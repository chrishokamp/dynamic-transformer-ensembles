       "   'summary': '– By now, everyone should know not to get too close to hippos in the wild or in captivity, but a California man didn\\'t get the memo. Officials at the Los Angeles Zoo tell the Los Angeles Times they\\'ve recruited the LAPD to help look for a most unusual sort of trespasser: a man caught on tape scaling a barrier and slapping one of two hippos in the pen below. The now-viral video, recorded from the other side of the enclosure by what sounds to be a young woman, shows the man slowly climbing over a railing, then reaching down to slap the butt of 4-year-old Rosie, who appeared to be snacking alongside her mother, Mara. Mara looks up briefly, and the person shooting the video can be heard giggling as the man lifts his arms up in an apparent victory stretch and runs off. But zoo officials warn that what happened was anything but funny. \"Any unauthorized interaction with an animal is unsafe for the animal and potentially unsafe for the patron,\" a zoo spokeswoman says, noting something like this also breaks down the animals\\' trust that zookeepers have worked so hard to instill. The BBC notes hippos are responsible for more human deaths in Africa than any other big animal. The suspect could be hit with a misdemeanor charge or other infraction—California law bars anyone from climbing into zoo enclosures—but the case is being investigated as a trespassing violation, not an animal cruelty one, as the animals didn\\'t seem particularly fazed by the incident.\\n'}),\n",

       "   'summary': '– An Italian WWII pilot who died battling US pilots 70 years ago has been found 13 feet underground, his remains still at the controls of a fighter plane armed with machine guns and cannons, Discovery reports. Lt. Guerrino Bortolani went down in a losing battle against Allied planes on March 11, 1944, and hit the ground so hard that he literally vanished into the countryside outside Padua in northern Italy. \"The crash site is now a cornfield,\" says a member of the wreck-hunting crew that found Bortolani. \"We were able to find the remains with the help of an elderly man, who on that day witnessed the fighter going into a nosedive and hit the ground.\" Bortolani was flying the best Italian fighter plane (the Macchi C.205) in a squadron led by the renowned Italian ace Adriano Visconti. But they went up against a daunting strike by the Mediterranean Allied Strategic Air Force—which had sent 111 B-17 planes over Padua to drop more than 300 tons of bombs. Allies said the Axis defense was \"aggressive,\" but five German planes and four Italian planes went down. Bortolani was \"dutiful until the end,\" the Week notes, sitting on his closed parachute and wearing a ring given him by a fighter pilot academy. Wreck-hunters found several parts of the plane as well, including the tail wheel, control stick, and pieces of the engine. Bortolani is expected to have a proper burial once relatives are found.

According to Local 10 News, 19-year-old Kenneth Davenport failed to serve Sgt. Jennifer Martin, who was in uniform and driving a patrol car according to USA Today, after she ordered in the drive-thru. Davenport\\'s manager allegedly told Martin that Davenport didn\\'t want to serve her because she was an officer and laughed while telling her Davenport had the right to not serve her, but then gave her the food himself. She was ultimately given a refund, though, after deciding she didn\\'t want to eat the food. “I am offended and appalled that an individual within our community would treat a police officer in such a manner,\" the Pembroke Pines chief of police tells CBS. \"It is unacceptable.\" In response to the alleged slight, officers\\' wives protested outside the restaurant today, and the Dade County Police Benevolent Association called for a boycott of Arby\\'s until the employee or employees responsible are fired, Local 10 reports. \"This is yet another example of the hostile treatment of our brave men and women simply because they wear a badge,\" according to a statement from the union president, who tells Local 10 he blames Obama for the lack of respect shown officers.

Mammuthus creticus is the tiniest mammoth ever found, and is another example of \"dwarfism\" on islands, where scare resources can keep animals small, notes the Telegraph. Fossilized teeth of the three-foot-tall mammoth were first discovered in 1904, but were initially believed to be elephant teeth. Scientists only recently re-examined them and determined they were evidence of a miniature mammoth. They also returned to the spot in Crete and discovered a mini leg bone. \"Dwarfism is a well-known evolutionary response of large mammals to island environments,\" said lead researcher Victoria Herrige from London\\'s Natural History Museum. \"Our findings show that on Crete, island dwarfism occurred to an extreme degree, producing the smallest mammoth known so far.\" Researchers believe the animals may have evolved from regular-sized mammoths as long as 3.5 million years ago.\\n'}),\n",

Fifteen months later, the little girl is still with social service workers, who won\\'t return her to her mother. The case is now \"an international legal row,\" the Telegraph says, and the anonymous woman\\'s lawyers call it \"unprecedented.\" The woman was in Britain in July 2012 for an airline training course, and called police when she suffered the panic attack. They arrived while she was on the phone with her mother, who told police the woman suffered from bipolar disorder and was off her medication, according to a Telegraph columnist. Police took her to a psychiatric facility, and restrained her under the Mental Health Act when she said she wanted to go back to her hotel. She underwent the C-section after having been there five weeks. The case is ongoing; the mother says she has made a full recovery, but a judge nonetheless ruled that her daughter should be put up for adoption. More on the case here and here.\\n'}),\n",
