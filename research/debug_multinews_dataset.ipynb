NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Several other people, possibly dozens, were found in the truck, which didn\\'t have a working air conditioning system, and they were taken to hospitals, firefighters said.

       "   'text': 'A still image taken from Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) video footage shows what they say is a small unidentified aircraft shot down in a mid-air interception after it crossed into southern Israel October 6, 2012. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR DUBAI (Reuters) - The incursion by an unmanned aircraft into Israeli airspace at the weekend exposed the weakness of Israeli air defenses, an Iranian military official was quoted as saying on Monday. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Israeli air force shot down a drone on Saturday after it crossed into southern Israel, the military said, but it remained unclear where the aircraft had come from. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Jamaluddin Aberoumand, deputy coordinator for Iran\\'s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said the incident indicated that Israel\\'s Iron Dome anti-missile defense system \"does not work and lacks the necessary capacity\", Fars news agency reported. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Iron Dome system, jointly funded with the United States, is designed to shoot down short-range guerrilla rockets, not slow-flying aircraft. It intercepted more than 80 percent of the targets it engaged in March when nearly 300 rockets and mortars were fired at southern Israel, the Pentagon said at the time. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The drone was first spotted above the Mediterranean near the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip to the west of Israel, said military spokeswoman Avital Leibovich. An Israeli warplane shot it down above a forest near the occupied West Bank. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israeli parliament member Miri Regev, a former chief spokesman of the military, wrote on Twitter it was an \"Iranian drone launched by Hezbollah\", referring to the Lebanese Shi\\'ite group that fought a war with Israel in 2006. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israeli defense officials have not confirmed this. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Aberoumand attributed claims the drone was made by Iran to a \"psychological operation\" by Israel, but did not confirm or deny them. \"The Zionist regime (Israel) has many enemies,\" he added. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR On at least one occasion, Iranian-backed Hezbollah has sent a drone into Israeli airspace. And in 2010, an Israeli warplane shot down an apparently unmanned balloon in the Negev near the country\\'s Dimona nuclear reactor. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Israeli military released a 10-second video clip of what it said was Saturday\\'s mid-air interception, showing a small aircraft just before a missile from a fighter jet destroys it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israel has threatened to bomb Iran\\'s nuclear sites if diplomatic efforts fail to stop the nuclear work it believes is aimed at getting weapons capability, a charge Tehran denies. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Iran has responded with threats to attack U.S. military bases in the region and retaliate against Israel if attacked.

       "   'text': 'GAZA Israel said it struck targets in the Gaza Strip on Monday after Palestinian militants fired rockets at southern Israel, in what they said was a response to an Israeli air strike that killed one militant and wounded a second a day earlier. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Israel said its air raid targeted 25-year-old Mohammed Makawi whom it linked to a radical group involved in a recent Sinai border attack in which an Israeli was killed. Hospital sources in Gaza said Makawi died of his wounds. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The armed wing of Hamas, the Islamists who control the Gaza Strip, said it had joined in Monday\\'s rocket attack along with the smaller Islamic Jihad group. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gaza has been under the control of Hamas since 2007. The Islamist group rejects permanent peace with Israel and the two sides fought a three-week war in December-January 2008-2009. The border is tense, with frequent clashes. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Israeli army says over 470 rockets have been fired from Gaza this year, but it was the first time since June that Hamas had acknowledged launching rockets at Israel. A Hamas spokesman said the movement would not remain passive in the face of what it called \"one-sided\" Israeli violence. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Israeli army said it had targeted \"Hamas terror activity sites and terrorist squads responsible for the rocket fire\", but gave no details. Israeli forces say they will not tolerate such attacks and will hold Hamas responsible for them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Gaza hospital officials said one Islamic Jihad militant thought to have been involved in the rocket attack had been wounded by Israeli tank fire east of the town of Rafah. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Residents of Khan Younis in southern Gaza said an Israeli tank fired at the suspected launch area, slightly wounding four children and damaging a minaret and a water tower. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Abu Ubaida, spokesman of the Hamas armed wing Izz El-Deen Al-Qassam Brigades, said the rocket firing was a message to Israel that it would not accept \"a formula of a one-sided aggression by the occupation on flimsy pretexts\". NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR With Egyptian mediation, Hamas has made efforts in the past to clamp down on smaller militant groups that persist in mounting attacks on Israel, partly in order to avoid another devastating war. The Israeli offensive in the winter of 2009 killed more than 1,000 Palestinians. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But on Monday Abu Ubaida said Hamas had displayed a \"high level of coordination\" with Islamic Jihad in unleashing the latest rocket barrage. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"Should the enemy continue its aggression against the Gaza Strip the reaction by the resistance will be stronger and broader,\" he said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The homemade weapons fired from Gaza are inaccurate, but potentially lethal. An Israeli spokeswoman said some exploded harmlessly on Monday near the border with the Gaza Strip. But one kibbutz resident said children could have been killed. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \"It was a very powerful barrage,\" Ilan Yosef of Kibbutz Nir Yitzhak near the Gaza border told Israel radio. \"The goat pen in the (children\\'s) petting corner was severely hit and a vet is treating the animals still alive and dealing with those that aren\\'t.\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR (Reporting by Nidal al-Mughrabi Writing by Ori Lewis; Editing by Alistair Lyon)\\n'}],\n",

      "      \"text\": \"(CNN) At least nine people are dead after a phone call from a Walmart employee led to the discovery of dozens of undocumented immigrants severely injured in the back of a tractor-trailer in Texas early Sunday, according to federal authorities. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR More than 100 undocumented immigrants may have been sandwiched in the back of the 18-wheeler during the journey, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement acting Director Thomas Homan said, citing initial interviews with survivors. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\\"Checking the video from the store, we found there were a number of vehicles that came in and picked up a lot of the folks that were in that trailer that survived the trip,\\\" San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said. \\\"We are looking at a human trafficking crime here.\\\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The employee told authorities the trailer was parked at a Walmart lot in San Antonio. A man who was in it asked the employee for water. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The employee brought water for the man, then called police and asked them to conduct a welfare check, McManus said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR That's when authorities discovered eight bodies and 31 people suffering from various injuries, authorities said. A ninth victim later died at a hospital, ICE officials said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR San Antonio officers investigate the scene where people were found dead in a tractor-trailer outside a Walmart. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\\"We quickly called a 'mass casualty incident' and had about 29 units arrive out there and start transporting people,\\\" San Antonio Fire Chief Charles Hood said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\\"With heat strokes or heat injuries, a lot of them are going to have some irreversible brain damage.\\\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR A heatstroke can cause swelling of the brain and other vital organs, possibly causing permanent damage, if a person's body temperature isn't quickly lowered, according to the Mayo Clinic NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Officials said the air conditioner in the trailer was not working. And the high temperature in San Antonio on Saturday was 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius). NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\\"Unfortunately, some of them were severely overheated, and that was a refrigerated truck with no refrigeration,\\\" Hood said. \\\"So the inside of the truck was just austere condition that nobody was going to survive in it. So we were very fortunate that they were found.\\\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Two of the people hospitalized are 15 years old, the fire spokesman said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Feds join the investigation NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Authorities don't know where the trailer is from or how long it was parked at Walmart, but they are reviewing surveillance video. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Police also searched the area with helicopters after some people ran into the woods. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR JUST WATCHED Fire chief: Truck had austere conditions Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Fire chief: Truck had austere conditions 00:47 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The US Attorney's Office said the driver, James Matthew Bradley Jr., 60, of Clearwater, Florida, was being held in connection with the incident, authorities said. Prosecutors plan to file a criminal complaint against Bradley in federal court on Monday morning. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\\"The driver and whoever else we find is involved in this will be facing state and federal charges,\\\" McManus said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\\"Fortunately, we came across this one and fortunately there are people who survived but this happens all the time,\\\" he said. \\\"You can see that it happens late at night under darkness because they don't want to be discovered.\\\" NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Once the victims undergo treatment, the case will be turned over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the police chief said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Homan deplored the discovery as the latest major case of human smuggling in the United States. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\\"By any standard, the horrific crime uncovered last night ranks as a stark reminder of why human smuggling networks must be pursued, caught and punished,\\\" Homan said in a statement. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR He said in fiscal year 2016, Homeland Security Investigations launched 2,110 human smuggling investigations, which resulted in 1,522 criminal convictions. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR During that same year, he said, HSI made 2,734 criminal arrests and 3,007 administrative arrests related to human smuggling operations. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In Sunday's case, \\\"These people were helpless in the hands of their transporters,\\\" said Richard L. Durbin Jr., US attorney for the Western District of Texas.

(AP) \\u2014 A suspect in the death of a pregnant woman initially claimed the woman gave up her newborn daughter but later admitted taking advantage of her to get the child, according to court documents filed Monday that shed no light on how the woman died. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Brooke Crews, 38, and her boyfriend William Hoehn (HAYN), 32, were each charged with conspiracy to commit murder in the death of 22-year-old Savanna Greywind.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\\"Savanna was a victim of a cruel and vicious act of depravity,\\\" Fargo police Chief David Todd said. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The complaint offers conflicting stories from the two suspects.

NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Family members declined to comment outside the courtroom. Amanda Vivier, a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, said she struggled with her emotions during the hearing. Greywind was also a member of the tribe.

Authorities recovered her body from the Red River on Sunday night, three days after finding the newborn. The girl, who was in good health, was with Crews when she was arrested.

I\\u2019m sitting in the passenger seat of a camo-painted ATV, rumbling through the northern Louisiana backwoods with Phil Robertson, founder of the Duck Commander company, patriarch at the heart of A&E\\u2019s smash reality hit Duck Dynasty, and my tour guide for the afternoon. There are seat belts in this ATV, but it doesn\\u2019t look like they\\u2019ve ever been used. Phil is not wearing one. I am not wearing one, because I don\\u2019t want Phil to think I\\u2019m a pussy. (Too late!) The crossbow\\u2014a Barnett model equipped with a steel-tipped four-blade broadhead arrow\\u2014is perched on the dash between us. It looks like you could shoot through a goddamn mountain with it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\u201cThat\\u2019ll bury up in you and kill you dead,\\u201d Phil says. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The bow is cocked and loaded, just in case a deer stumbles in front of us and we need to do a redneck drive-by on the poor bastard, but the safety is on. SAFETY FIRST. Still, Phil warns me, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t want to be bumping that.\\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR As we drive out into the woods, past a sign that reads parish maintenance ends, Phil is telling me all about the land around us and how the animals are a glorious gift from God and how blowing their heads off is part of His plan for us. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\u201cLook at this,\\u201d he says, gesturing to the surrounding wilderness. \\u201cThe Almighty gave us this. Genesis 9 is where the animals went wild, and God gave them wildness. After the flood, that\\u2019s when he made animals wild. Up until that time, everybody was vegetarian. After the flood, he said, \\u2018I\\u2019m giving you everything now. Animals are wild.\\u2019\\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR There\\u2019s a fly parked on Phil\\u2019s long beard. It\\u2019s been there the whole ride, and I desperately want to pluck it out, but I decide against it. Along with the crossbow, there\\u2019s a loaded .22-caliber rifle rattling around in the footwell. And yet, much like the 14 million Americans who Nielsen says tune in to Duck Dynasty every week\\u2014over 2 million more than the audience for the Breaking Bad finale\\u2014I am comfortable here in these woods with Phil and his small cache of deadly weaponry. He is welcoming and gracious. He is a man who preaches the gospel of the outdoors and, to my great envy, practices what he preaches. He spends most of his time out here, daydreaming about what he calls a \\u201cpristine earth\\u201d: a world where nothing gets in the way of nature or the hunters who lovingly maintain it. No cities. No buildings. No highways. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Oh, and no sinners, too. So here\\u2019s where things get a bit uncomfortable. Phil calls himself a Bible-thumper, and holy shit, he thumps that Bible hard enough to ring the bell at a county-fair test of strength. If you watch Duck Dynasty, you can hear plenty of it in the nondenominational supper-table prayer the family recites at the end of every episode, and in the show\\u2019s no-cussing, no-blaspheming tone. But there are more things Phil would like to say\\u2014\\u201ccontroversial\\u201d things, as he puts it to me\\u2014that don\\u2019t make the cut. (This March, for instance, he told the Christian-oriented Sports Spectrum magazine that he didn\\u2019t approve of A&E editing out \\u201cin Jesus\\u201d from a family prayer scene, even though A&E says that the phrase has been uttered in at least seventeen episodes.) NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Out here in these woods, without any cameras around, Phil is free to say what he wants. Maybe a little too free. He\\u2019s got lots of thoughts on modern immorality, and there\\u2019s no stopping them from rushing out. Like this one: NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\u201cIt seems like, to me, a vagina\\u2014as a man\\u2014would be more desirable than a man\\u2019s anus. That\\u2019s just me. I\\u2019m just thinking: There\\u2019s more there! She\\u2019s got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I\\u2019m saying? But hey, sin: It\\u2019s not logical, my man. It\\u2019s just not logical.\\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Perhaps we\\u2019ll be needing that seat belt after all. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The Duck Dynasty origin story is the mighty river from which all other Robertson-family stories flow. And it is an awesome story, one that improves the more it is told, so here is my stab at it: Phil Robertson grew up bone poor in the northwest corner of this state\\u2014a place where Cajun redneck culture and Ozark redneck culture intersect\\u2014to a manic-depressive mother and a roughneck father. He was a star quarterback in high school and earned a scholarship to play at Louisiana Tech, but quit after one season because football interfered with duck-hunting season. The guy who took his roster spot at Tech was Terry Bradshaw, because that\\u2019s how these kinds of stories go. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Phil On Growing Up in Pre-Civil-Rights-Era Louisiana NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\u201cI never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I\\u2019m with the blacks, because we\\u2019re white trash. We\\u2019re going across the field.... They\\u2019re singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, \\u2018I tell you what: These doggone white people\\u2019\\u2014not a word!... Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.\\u201d NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR According to Phil\\u2019s autobiography\\u2014a ghostwritten book he says he has never read\\u2014he spent his days after Tech doing odd jobs and his evenings getting drunk, chasing tail, and swallowing diet pills and black mollies, a form of medicinal speed. In his midtwenties, already married with three sons, a piss-drunk Robertson kicked his family out of the house. \\u201cI\\u2019m sick of you,\\u201d he told his wife, Kay. But Robertson soon realized the error of his ways, begged Kay to come back, and turned over his life to Jesus Christ. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR In 1972, with Jesus at the wheel, Robertson founded the Duck Commander company, which sold a line of custom-made duck-hunting calls that quickly became popular among avid hunters for their uncanny accuracy in replicating the sound of a real duck. He eventually sold half the company to his son Willie, now 41, and together they made a DVD series about the family\\u2019s duck hunts, which led to a show on the Outdoor Channel, which led to Duck Dynasty on A&E, which led to everything blowing right the fuck up. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR The show\\u2014a reality sitcom showcasing the semiscripted high jinks of Phil, his brother \\u201cUncle Si,\\u201d his four sons, Alan, Willie, Jase, and Jep, and the perpetually exasperated but always perfectly accessorized Robertson-family ladies\\u2014has become the biggest reality-TV hit in the history of cable television, reportedly earning the family a holy shit\\u2013worthy $200,000-an-episode paycheck. It\\u2019s a funny, family-friendly show, with \\u201cskits that we come up with,\\u201d as Phil describes the writing process. They plunder beehives. They blow up beaver dams. And when the Robertson-family ladies go up to a rooftop in a hydraulic lift, you just know that lift will \\u201caccidentally\\u201d get stuck and strand them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR But the show, whose fifth season premieres on January 15, is just one part of the family\\u2019s pop-cultural dominance. In 2013 four books written (kind of!) by Robertson family members made the top ten on the New York Times nonfiction best-seller list. Another book\\u2014penned by Jase Robertson and detailing his Christian rebirth at age 14, his struggle to forgive his father\\u2019s past behavior, and his young daughter\\u2019s struggle through five facial-reconstruction surgeries to overcome a severe cleft lip and palate\\u2014is forthcoming and destined to make it five best-sellers. There\\u2019s also a book of devotionals somewhere in there, along with Duck Dynasty\\u2013themed birthday cards, bobblehead dolls, camo apparel (pink camo for the ladies), Cajun-spice seasoning, car fresheners, iPhone games (from the press release: \\u201cAs players successfully complete the challenges, their beards grow to epic proportions and they start to transform from a yuppie into a full-blown redneck!\\u201d), and presumably some sort of camou flage home-pregnancy test. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR It\\u2019s easy to see the appeal. The Robertsons are immensely likable. They\\u2019re funny. They look cool. They\\u2019re \\u201csmarter than they look,\\u201d says sportswriter Mark Schlabach, who co-writes the family\\u2019s books. And they are remarkably honest both with one another and with the viewing audience: Phil\\u2019s old hell-raising, Si\\u2019s traumatic stint in Vietnam, the intervention that the family staged for Jep when he was boozing and doing drugs in college (Phil placed him under house arrest for three months)\\u2014all of it is out in the open. The more they reveal, the more people feel connected to them. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR And then, of course, there is their faith, which plays no small role here. During the family\\u2019s initial negotiations about the show with A&E, Jase told me, \\u201cthe three no-compromises were faith, betrayal of family members, and duck season.\\u201d That refusal to betray their faith or one another has been a staple of every media article about the Robertson family. It\\u2019s their elevator pitch, and it has made them into ideal Christian icons: beloved for staking out a bit of holy ground within the mostly secular, often downright sinful, pop culture of America. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR \\u00b7 \\u00b7 \\u00b7 NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Phil Robertson\\u2019s house is located in the sticks about twenty miles outside the city of Monroe (pronounce it mun-roe). It\\u2019s a rather small house\\u2014the kind of place its owner would proudly call \\u201chumble.\\u201d The kitchen table is covered with big plastic tubs of cinnamon rolls and mini muffins. There are candy dishes filled to the brim, bricks of softening butter, and packages of jerky made from unknown animals, sent by unnamed fans. (I tried some, and it was awesome.) Just inside the front door, a giant flat-screen TV shows Fox News on mute at all times, and a bunch of big squishy sofas are arranged in a rectangle around it. NEWLINE_CHAR NEWLINE_CHAR Si Robertson is sitting on the couch facing the TV. Jep Robertson, age 35, the youngest son, curls up in a recliner in the corner with a pistol strapped to his waist. He barely speaks, like a countrified Silent Bob. Jase, 44, and Willie share a love seat while Phil lounges barefoot on a camo-patterned recliner in the far corner of the room. Two dogs share the recliner\\u2019s footrest with Phil\\u2019s heavily callused bare feet. He has severe bunions, so his big toes jut in at forty-five-degree angles. The main TV room is cluttered with mismatched furniture and photos hung haphazardly on the walls. And Phil looks like part of the clutter himself, as if he\\u2019d been wedged into that recliner a while back by some absentminded homeowner who didn\\u2019t know where else to put him.\"\n",
