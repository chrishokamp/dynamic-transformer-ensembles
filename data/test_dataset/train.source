Republicans Keep Senate Majority As Democrats Make Gains In The House  [SEP]  Republicans Keep Senate Majority As Democrats Make Gains In The House Republicans will maintain control of the Senate for at least two more years, after Democratic losses in Indiana, Tennessee, Texas and North Dakota — states that President Trump won by double digits in 2016. Trump campaigned aggressively in those states. Senate GOP leaders capitalized on a battleground map that left Democrats defending 26 seats, including ten in states President Trump won in 2016. Now they must defend President Trump's hard-line rhetoric and policy on issues like immigration and trade, despite tensions within the party over those same issues. Trump was not on the ballot this year but he has been an unmistakable force in congressional contests and statewide elections across the country. Early vote data released early Tuesday indicated that the electorate was shaping up to be younger and more diverse from the last midterm election. Turnout levels were already significantly higher across several demographic groups, and up in states with competitive Senate contests — Arizona, Texas and Nevada. The president's impact played out differently in the roughly 80 competitive House races and more than a dozen close Senate contests. Senate races in mostly red states benefited from Trump focus Senate Democrats faced a steep challenge as they fought to keep seats in states Trump won by double-digit margins in the worst battlefield for any party in modern history. Just six Republicans were up for re-election, all but one of them ran in safely Republican states. They landed on a plan to allow each vulnerable Democrat to run an independent campaign without a unified platform. For example, Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota could stump on protecting farmers while Joe Manchin in West Virginia promised new health protections for coal miners. But Republicans had the advantage of simply reminding their base of all of the times Democrats voted against Trump. Heitkamp reached out to Trump White House officials and attempted to craft a bipartisan posture, but she voted against Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. And other red state Senate Democrats running for re-election — Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Joe Donnelly in Indiana — did the same. Trump personally played a significant role in tight Senate contests in the closing weeks of the election cycle. He traveled to Indiana, Florida, Montana, Nevada, Missouri and Mississippi — and in some cases landed in dramatic fashion aboard Air Force One to crowds of supporters enthusiastically cheering his red-meat speeches focused mostly on immigration and warnings about what Democratic control meant for his agenda. His visits included overt reminders to his base supporters that they weren't just voting for any Republican on the ballot — they were voting for senators promising to back his priorities. "They want to raise your taxes, the Democrats do, restore crippling regulations, shut down your new steel mills, take away your health care, and put illegal aliens before American citizens," Trump said in a closing rally in Indiana on Monday. "If you want more caravans, if you want more crime, vote Democrat tomorrow." House battlefield hinges on contests in suburban and exurban districts Democrats pinned their hopes for retaking the House on boosting turnout among women and minorities and wooing moderate suburban voters who were turned off by Trump. They focused on recruiting diverse candidates that might have once seemed outside the box for the party. That included gun owners and military veterans — and a lot of female candidates. The strategy was well tailored to turn out voters for House seats. It means Democrats will have to bridge the demands of a party that has grown to embrace progressives, like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is expected to win in a safely Democratic district in New York, while electing moderates like Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania, who won a special election earlier this year and is favored to win Tuesday in a reconfigured district. A Democratic caucus that's expected to expand will test the power and influence of leaders like Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who plans to seek another term as speaker of the House. Pelosi has been criticized by a vocal group inside the caucus as being out of touch with her changing party and unwilling to provide opportunities to newer members. She was the subject of millions of dollars in Republican attack ads this cycle, forcing more than a dozen candidates to publicly vow not to support her for speaker. That divide could make it difficult for House Democrats to unify around an agenda. Pelosi has vowed to pass campaign finance reform regulations and launch investigations into the Trump administration immediately. But there will be pressure from her most progressive flank to vote on proposals like a "Medicare-for-all" health care plan. Instead, Pelosi has promised to focus first on government and campaign finance reform measures. "When we win, on the opening day, our Democratic congress will be open and transparent," Pelosi said at an event Tuesday morning. Republicans will have to battle an opposite trend. Many moderate members chose to retire rather than face tough re-election campaigns. With the bulk of the competitive races focused in suburban districts, GOP candidates and leadership aides worried the president's tough rhetoric about immigration may have turned off women and independents in those areas. House Speaker Paul Ryan appealed to the president the weekend before the election to focus on the strong economy and benefits from the 2017 tax cut. While Trump did boast about these accomplishments, he continued to emphasize his push to crack down on the "caravan" — the group of Central American migrants heading toward the Mexican border with the United States. He also declared he would end birthright citizenship with an executive order — a proposal Ryan said would be unconstitutional. House GOP leaders are expecting to oversee a more conservative conference next year, with some losses expected in seats held by centrists. That tilt to the right will likely mean even more pressure by top leaders for members to stick together to vote on legislation that is closely aligned to Trump and his agenda. Democrats benefited from a flood of donations to official party organizations and outside groups working on their side. Democratic candidates and their outside supporters are expected to spend more than $2.5 billion on this year's election, according to the Center For Responsive Politics. Republican candidates and their backers are on track to spend $2.2 billion. Fundraising in 2018 far outpaced what is normal for a miderm election. Both parties saw dramatic surges in donations that were closely correlated with national political events like the hearings on sexual assault allegations during the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Donors responded to heated political battles, like funding a wall on the border with Mexico and Republicans' failed attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, by flooding candidates with cash.
Turing's Law: Thousands of convicted gay and bisexual men receive posthumous pardons  [SEP]  Thousands of gay men convicted of now-abolished sexual offences have been posthumously pardoned after a new law received Royal assent. The so-called Turing's Law, named after Alan Turing who was convicted of gross indecency in 1952 for having sex with a man, officially came into force today. The rule, contained in the Policing and Crime Bill, will allow gay and bisexual men convicted of consensual same-sex acts to be pardoned as long as it can be proved that the sexual act was consensual and the partner was over the age of consent.
Iranians mourn as former President Rafsanjani interred  [SEP]  TEHRAN, Iran – Hundreds of thousands mourned former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Tuesday, wailing in grief as his body was interred at a Tehran shrine alongside the leader of the country’s 1979 Islamic Revolution. Rafsanjani’s final resting place near the late Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, reflected his legacy as one of the pillars of Iran’s clerical-dominated political system, as he served in later years as a go-between for hard-liners and reformists. But even his hourslong funeral highlighted the divisions still at play. Parts of the crowd along his funeral procession at one point chanted in support of opposition leaders under house arrest. Other politicians did not attend the memorial. Throngs filled main thoroughfares of the capital, with many chanting, beating their chests and wailing in the style of mourning common among Shiite Muslims. The funeral for Rafsanjani, who died Sunday at age 82 after a heart attack, drew both the elite and ordinary people. Shops and schools were closed in national mourning. Top government and clerical officials first held a funeral service at Tehran University. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei prayed by Rafsanjani’s casket, as other dignitaries knelt before the coffin on which his white cleric’s turban was placed. Mourners reached out their hands toward the coffin. Just behind Khamenei was President Hassan Rouhani, whose moderate administration reached the recent nuclear deal with world powers. Rouhani, who is all but certain to run for re-election in May, is viewed as embodying Rafsanjani’s realist vision. Hard-liners also took part in the ceremony Tuesday, like the head of Iran’s judiciary, Sadeq Larijani, who stood near his moderate brother, parliament speaker Ali Larijani. Also among them was Qassem Soleimani, a general who heads the Revolutionary Guard’s elite Quds Force, which focuses on foreign operations like the war in Syria. Both Soleimani and Rafsanjani are from Iran’s southeastern province of Kerman and worked together during the war with Iraq in the 1980s. “In my opinion, Mr. Hashemi remained the same person from the beginning until the end and held his line in all stages of his life,” Soleimani told state television in a rare public interview. “Nevertheless, Mr. Hashemi sometimes used different tactics.” Apparently banned from the funeral was former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, a reformist who remains popular among the young but is deeply disliked by hard-liners. State media have banned the broadcasting of any images of Khatami. There was also no word of hard-line former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad attending the ceremony, though he offered condolences Monday. There was no love lost between the two as Ahmadinejad defeated Rafsanjani in Iran’s 2005 presidential election and later drew his dismay over the crackdown following his contested re-election in 2009. Outside, mourners carried posters bearing Rafsanjani’s image as his casket slowly made his way through the crowds in the streets. “I rarely attend religious ceremonies, but I am here as an Iranian who cannot forget Rafsanjani’s contribution to developing the political sphere in favor of people in recent years,” said Nima Sheikhi, a computer teacher at a private school. “I am here to say goodbye to a man who dedicated his life to making Iran better,” said Reza Babaei, a cleric from the eastern town of Birjand near the Afghan border. “He founded the university in my city and developed our region when he was in power.” Officials put the number of participants in the funeral at over 2 million, though that figure could not be independently verified. Iran’s internal politics also were on display. The semi-official ILNA news agency said that on the sidelines of the funeral, prominent moderate lawmaker Ali Motahari was asked by several mourners to free opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mahdi Karroubi from the house arrest the two have been under since 2011. “Our message is clear: The house arrest should be lifted,” some chanted. Police and security forces did not react to the chants, nor others that followed and could be heard in state television footage. Rafsanjani’s casket later arrived at the ornate, massive shrine to Khomeini, who led the revolution that toppled the American-backed shah. Rafsanjani’s interment there marked a rare privilege inside of Iran’s system, where clerics dominate the levers of power. Only Khomeini’s son Ahmad, who died in 1995 and served as a close aide to his father, had been buried next to his tomb before Tuesday. Rafsanjani, a close aide to both Khomeini and Khamenei, served as president from 1989 to 1997. He helped launch Iran’s nuclear program and then pushed for reconciliation with the West. Internally, however, his legacy remains mixed. He was massively wealthy and a veteran at maneuvering within Iran’s opaque political system. He was considered a protector of the moderates, but others distrusted him because he was such an insider and because of accusations he was involved in killing dissidents during his eight-year presidency, which he always denied. Hard-liners distrusted him because of his support of moderates and sought to sideline him, with little success. His absence in balancing the competing powers, however, will affect Iran going forward, especially as the country edges closer to picking a new supreme leader. “The unexpected death of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani could be the first scene in Iran’s nascent leadership transition theater, whose subsequent acts are probably yet to be written,” said Mehdi Khalaji, a fellow at The Washington Institute.
Thousands evacuated in South Africa as storm fans fires  [SEP]  Up to ten thousand people were evacuated from their homes as fires continued to ravage South Africa's Western Cape region on Thursday, fanned by a ferocious winter storm. Knysna, a town of 77,000 people 500 kilometres (310 miles) east of Cape Town on South Africa's famed Garden Route, was worst hit as firefighters battled to quell 26 fires along the tourist trail. High winds from a storm that claimed eight lives as it battered the Western Cape region have caused the blaze to spread rapidly. The storm, which struck on Tuesday, has damaged buildings, felled trees, left 46,000 homes without electricity and caused travel chaos as flights and rail services were hit by gale-force winds and flooding. Colin Deiner, the chief director of the Western Cape's fire service, told Voice of the Cape radio that at least 150 structures had been destroyed. Local officials are now considering calling on the air force to help extinguish the blazes. Western Cape premier Helen Zille told Kaya FM: "What we need is air power -- water-bombing, and helicopters to see which areas are affected and who needs to be evacuated." Zille has been suspended from her party -- the main opposition Democratic Alliance -- over tweets apparently endorsing colonialism, but remains head of the regional government. She spent the night in Knysna to coordinate the response of emergency services to the crisis. "The fire in Knysna is the largest and most destructive fire in a built up area in the Western Cape in recent memory with thousands displaced. It comes on the back of the worst storm seen in the Western Cape in at least thirty years," said Western Cape government spokesman James-Brent Styan in a statement. "To date between 8,000 and 10,000 Knysna inhabitants have been safely evacuated."
Wanted ex-Catalan Minister surrenders in Scotland  [SEP]  Edinburgh (UK), March 28 (IANS) A Catalan politician and academic wanted by Spain for her alleged role in a secessionist referendum ruled illegal by the judiciary handed herself to Scottish police on Wednesday as authorities began to deliberate over whether to execute an extradition order lodged by Madrid. Clara Ponsati, former regional Education Minister in Catalonia and Professor of Economics at the prestigious St. Andrews University in Scotland, arrived at St. Leonard’s police station accompanied by her lawyer Aamer Anwar, Efe news reported. “After we enter the police station, my client will be formally placed under arrest. The European arrest warrant will then be served upon and Ponsati will be transferred to Edinburgh Sheriff Court where she will appear from custody,” said Anwar, who is also the rector at the University of Glasgow. “The Spanish authorities wish to extradite Ponsati on charges of violent rebellion and misappropriation of public funds for helping to organise the referendum,” he said. “She does not believe that the Spanish Courts can guarantee independence, human rights or justice. Ponsati remains defiant, resolute and is determined to fight back,” he added. Ponsati was a close associate of Carles Puigdemont, the former Catalan President, who is currently held in a German jail awaiting a final decision on his extradition back to Spain. Puigdemont could face the same fate as several former Catalan political figureheads currently retained in pre-trial detention on the same potential charges. The former Education Chief, who could face decades in prison, travelled back to Scotland via Brussels to avoid a Spanish arrest warrant issued in relation to her alleged role in the independence referendum in October. The Principal of St. Andrews University, Professor Sally Mapstone, criticised the action taken by the Spanish judiciary as “an attack on free speech”. Ponsati was due to retake her economic research post at the University. The Scottish government, led by separatist Nicola Sturgeon, said it would raise the issue of the European arrest warrant with the European Commission. Shortly before she entered the police station, a crowdfunding initiative in support of Ponsati raised over $1,00,000 in a matter of hours.
Slovakia's Prime Minister Offers To Resign Amid Protest Over Journalist's Murder  [SEP]  The prime minister of Slovakia said Wednesday that he is ready to bow to demands for his resignation as the country's ruling coalition sought to calm anger sparked by the murder of an investigative journalist and his fiancée. Premier Robert Fico told reporters in the capital that he was prepared to leave office if his left-wing Smer-Social Democracy party is allowed to choose his successor. "I visited the president today, together with the coalition partners, and I proposed that in order to solve the political crisis I am ready to resign as prime minister," Fico said in a televised news conference. As Reuters notes, "President Andrej Kiska has called for a government revamp or early elections to rebuild what he says is a crisis of trust." The offer to resign follows Slovakia's largest protests since the Velvet Revolution of 1989. Demonstrators are calling for a thorough investigation of the shooting deaths of Jan Kuciak and Martina Kusnirova. At the time of his death last month, Kuciak, 27, had been writing about ties between the Italian mafia and individuals close to Fico. Deutsche Welle reports: "The killings reignited debate about corruption and press freedom in Slovakia, triggering mass anti-government demonstrations across the country." No one has been charged with the murders, although police have interviewed more than 100 people as part of their probe. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, reporting from Bratislava, says, "many Slovaks say Fico's departure won't be enough. They say the reputation of his government has been damaged." If the Slovak president accepts Fico's resignation, his successor could be named on Thursday, Soraya says.
Sen. McCain: Americans 'stupid' enough to want to visit North Korea should sign a waiver  [SEP]  U.S. Sen. John McCain said on Tuesday that Americans who are “stupid” enough to still want to visit North Korea should be required to sign a waiver absolving the U.S. government of any blame if they’re harmed while there. “There should at least be a form for them to fill out that says, ‘If I go to North Korea, I understand I am taking great risk, and I do not hold the American government responsible," the senator from Arizona said. "If people are that stupid that they still want to go to that country, then at least they assume the responsibility for their welfare.” U.S. college student Otto Warmbier died Monday, days after his release from North Korea. McCain is the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
US grand jury impaneled for Russia probe: report  [SEP]  The newspaper, citing two unnamed sources familiar with the matter, reported that the grand jury had begun its work in the US capital Washington “in recent weeks.” The move is a sign that the sweeping federal investigation — which includes allegations that Trump campaign officials coordinated with Russia to tilt the election in the Republican’s favor — is gathering pace. The establishment of a grand jury will allow Mueller — a former FBI director — to subpoena documents and get sworn testimony. It could well lead to criminal indictments. “You don’t impanel a grand jury unless your investigation has discovered enough evidence that you feel reflects a violation of at least one, if not more, criminal provisions,” he said. “If you secure an indictment, your next step is to arrest the defendant.” Presidential lawyer Ty Cobb said he was not aware that a grand jury had been convened. “Grand jury matters are typically secret,” Cobb said, adding that “the White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly.” “The White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr Mueller.” White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders claimed the president was not likely the subject of the investigation. “Former FBI director Jim Comey said three times the president is not under investigation and we have no reason to believe that has changed,” she said. Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores declined to comment on the report. Trump has repeatedly denied allegations of collusion, saying he is the victim of a political “witch hunt” and “fake news.” But Trump has been forced to acknowledge that his eldest son, Donald Jr, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then campaign advisor Paul Manafort did meet a Kremlin-connected lawyer to get dirt on Hillary Clinton. Mueller is also said to be investigating Trump’s financial records unrelated to Russia or the election, CNN reported. Trump has publicly warned Mueller that his financial dealings should be out of bounds and investigating them would cross a red line. If called to testify before a grand jury, Trump would not be the first president to do so. Then president Bill Clinton was forced to give details about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, evidence that was used in his impeachment. Thursday’s revelations will only fuel speculation that Trump may try to curb the investigation by firing Mueller. Two US senators introduced a bipartisan bill Thursday to pre-empt that move by insulating Mueller. The legislation, sponsored by Democrat Chris Coons and Republican Thom Tillis, would bar a president from directly firing the special counsel without a judicial review. Under the bill, Mueller would be allowed to challenge his removal in court in the event he is fired without good cause. “A back-end judicial review process to prevent unmerited removals of special counsels not only helps to ensure their investigatory independence, but also reaffirms our nation’s system of check and balances,” Tillis said in a statement. Coons added: “Ensuring that the special counsel cannot be removed improperly is critical to the integrity of his investigation.”
China police confirm illegally made, stored explosives killed 14  [SEP]  The explosion in the northwestern town of Xinmin in Shaanxi province injured 147 people and damaged dozens of buildings, including a hospital. "Three suspects were arrested early Tuesday morning. All three confessed their guilt," Xinhua said late on Tuesday, adding that authorities had launched a province-wide investigation into the production and storage of explosives. The five houses where the blast occurred were rental properties and their owner had been taken into police custody, the news agency said. It was unclear what type of explosives caused the blast or what their intended use was, but Shaanxi is a coal-mining province and explosives are widely used in the industry. Previous blasts have been blamed on improperly stored chemicals or industrial explosives. Explosions at fireworks factories are also not uncommon. A series of powerful blasts last year at a chemicals warehouse in the northern port city of Tianjin killed 165 people. There have also been cases of people deliberately setting off blasts to settle grievances such as land disputes.
Belgians, Dutch join in opposing Trump's anti-abortion plans  [SEP]  BRUSSELS (AP) — Belgium is joining the Netherlands in backing the creation of an international fund to finance access to birth control, abortion and sex education for women in developing countries in an attempt to make up for U.S. President Donald Trump’s ban on U.S. funding. Alexander De Croo, Belgium’s minister for foreign trade and development, says he is fully behind the initiative of his Dutch counterpart to set up an international fund for safe abortions. De Croo says Wednesday that “this decision of the White House has an immediate impact on the lives of millions of girls and women in developing nations.” Trump’s executive memorandum signed Monday reinstituted a ban on U.S. funding to international groups that perform abortions or even provide information about abortions. A day later, The Netherlands said it wanted to set up the fund and invited governments, businesses and social organizations to join in to “compensate for this financial setback.” The ban on performing or even talking about abortions has been instituted by Republican administrations and rescinded by Democratic ones since 1984. Former President Barack Obama last lifted it in 2009. Belgium already has teenage pregnancy programs in Mali and Niger and works with U.N. organizations in Guinea for better family planning. De Croo insisted Trump would only achieve the opposite of what he wanted. “Research shows that ending support to these organizations leads to less access to contraceptives. Hence, it increases the numbers of abortions” and often in unsanitary conditions, he said. “The result of the measure is that many teenage girls will be scarred for the rest of their lives, or even lose their lives.” De Croo’s Dutch counterpart, Lilianne Ploumen, said Trump’s measure would undermine the progress of the last few years. “We cannot let this happen,” she said.

Dick Morris: Trump Is Doing It for Himself  [SEP]  How much difference can one man make, even if he is president? Donald Trump is a testament to the answer: An enormous amount! Credit his tax cut and other policies, but the fact is that the economy turned around as soon as it became clear that Trump was elected. Business people changed their investment plans and job-hiring policies the minute they saw who the new president was. The power of Trump over the economy was partially due to trust in his private-sector background and instincts. But it was also due to the massive anti-business, anti-growth and anti-jobs agenda of his predecessor. How could anyone fail to notice the difference? And then, the promise of his inauguration was quickly vindicated by a host of deregulatory decisions. He pulled out of the Paris Climate Accords. He deregulated the energy and coal sectors. He opened new areas for oil exploration and drilling. He reversed anti-business labor policies. And, 1 year into his term, he passed an enormous tax cut and an even more important tax reform. In foreign policy, his personal impact was even more profound. It has taken a year, but Donald Trump has managed to right our priorities in foreign affairs. He has bonded closer with Israel with his historic decision to let the Jewish state decide for itself on where its national capital is to be located. We are working again with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf monarchies against Iran. Sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin have tightened and Ukraine is getting effective military aid, stalemating Russian aggression. NATO members are increasing their defense spending by 5 percent each and the American military is being upgraded. We have left the Paris Climate Accords and are on the verge of tearing up the one-sided deal with Iran. This will leave the Ayatollah with no real choice but compliance, otherwise the harsh sanctions that led him to negotiate in the first place will return — this time with Trump running them. Sanctions on Russia are tighter. We are challenging China on trade. We have brought Venezuela to its knees. North Korea is in retreat. Finally, our sanctions are working. Credit our tough stance in forcing bold sanctions resolutions through the U.N. And we have unveiled a new sanctions weapon: sanctions targeting individuals and businesses. If you defy the international consensus on human rights, you risk not being able to put your money in the bank … or take it out. You can’t send or receive wires. You are excommunicated from the global banking system, a punishment as dire as any Medieval pope could impose.

Finland deadly stabbing now called terrorism  [SEP]  A woman from the town in Finland is in Denver right now.
Egypt security forces kill 40 suspected militants  [SEP]  Egyptian security forces have killed 40 suspected militants in three separate incidents in North Sinai and Giza, the ministry of interior said on Saturday, a day after a deadly bombing on a tourist bus in Giza killed four people. The ministry did not say whether the suspected militants were connected to Friday’s attack, but said its forces killed 30 people during raids on their hideouts in Giza where it said “terrorist elements” were planning a series of attacks targeting state institutions and the tourism industry. Security forces also killed 10 suspected militants in North Sinai, where the country is fighting an insurgency led by Islamic State, also known as Isis. State news agency Mena said that the suspects were killed in a gun battle. The ministry did not give any details about the suspects’ identity or whether there had been any casualties or injuries among the security forces. The statement said the three raids took place simultaneously. The ministry published photos of bloodied bodies with their faces concealed and assault rifles and shotguns lying on the floor beside them. Three Vietnamese tourists and an Egyptian guide were killed and at least 10 others injured when a roadside bomb blast hit their tour bus on Friday less than 4km (2.5 miles) from the world-famous Giza pyramids. Egypt’s military and police launched a major campaign against militant groups in February, targeting the Sinai Peninsula as well as southern areas and the border with Libya. The government says fighting Islamist militants is a priority as it works to restore stability after the years of turmoil that followed the “Arab Spring” protests of 2011. – Reuters
Human rights group applies to join extradition to Poland case  [SEP]  A civil society group has applied to join High Court proceedings in which an Irish judge has asked the European Courts to rule on whether mutual trust continues to exist between Poland and other Member States in EU extradition cases. Fair Trial Europe, a non-Governmental organisation (NGO) which aims to “defend the human right to a fair trial”, has applied to join High Court extradition proceedings involving Artur Celmer, who is wanted to face trial in his native Poland on drug trafficking charges. The proposed surrender of Mr Celmer, who was arrested in Ireland on foot of a European Arrest Warrant last May, was referred to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) last week for a ruling on the effect of recent legislative changes in Poland concerning the Polish judiciary, courts and public prosecutor. In her decision to refer the case to Europe, Ms Justice Aileen Donnelly said a number of recent legislative changes in Poland were “so immense” that the High Court was forced to conclude that the rule of law in Poland had been “systematically damaged”. Ms Justice Donnelly received suggested questions to send to Europe from the parties today although the precise wording is a matter for her. She said she would conclude all matters by the end of this week adding that she wouldn’t delay matters any further. The proposed questions centre on which legal tests apply where the High Court, as an executing judicial authority, has found that the common value of the rule of law in Poland has been systemically breached. A representatives from the Embassy of the Republic of Poland in Dublin was present in court for the matter. Also in court were lawyers for Fair Trial Europe who made an application to join proceedings as an ‘amicus curiae’, or friend of the court, to assist matters. Counsel for Fair Trial Europe, Brian Gageby BL, told Ms Justice Donnelly that his client wished to become involved in the matter when it goes before the CJEU and to provide assistance in terms of the questions being asked. Mr Gageby said he fully appreciated the timing of the application, coming in at the “tail end of the case”. He said his client did not wish to meddle in proceedings. Their desired intention was to assist the CJEU, whether the NGO was permitted to be joined as an ‘amicus curiae’ or not. Mr Gageby said the question was one of utility and what the proposed ‘amicus curiae’ could add to the proceedings. Referring to an unsuccessful attempt by a “pro-life group” to join a recent Supreme Court case, Mr Gageby said it was held that the proposed ‘amicus curiae’ in that case had not indicated what they were “bringing to bear” in those proceedings. He said Fair Trial Europe was an organisation with very considerable experience in dealing with the questions that were before the court in a pan-European context. Counsel for the Minister for Justice, Remy Farrell SC, said Fair Trial Europe’s application had been made at the eleventh hour. That militated against allowing the NGO to be joined when an urgent preliminary ruling procedure was being contemplated. Mr Farrell said the rules of the CJEU clearly stated that a person or body, who is not a party to the original proceedings before the domestic courts, cannot apply to be joined to proceedings in the CJEU. He said it was difficult to understand what kind of unique perspective Fair Trial Europe could bring when their expertise related to the analysis and monitoring of trials after people had been surrendered or extradited. That was “precisely the issue that’s missing in this case,” referring to the fact Mr Celmer has not been surrendered or extradited. Ms Justice Donnelly said she was going to consider all of the issues before her and would not delay matters any further. She said she would send the referral to Europe “as soon as possible”. She said the application by Fair Trial Europe to join proceedings had, in one sense, caused a delay because the court had to consider the matter but the NGO was entitled to a ruling. She said she would conclude all issues by the end of this week. Mr Celmer was remanded until July 23rd next with liberty to bring the matter forward pending a decision from the CJEU. Ms Justice Donnelly asked Mr Farrell how many Polish European Arrest Warrants were directly affected by this issue and, in particular, how many affected people were in custody. Since her ruling, a distinction has been made between persons wanted in Poland for prosecution and persons wanted who had already been convicted and/or sentenced. Since her ruling, a number of people have been surrendered to Poland but only those who were already convicted and/or sentenced. Mr Farrell said it should be possible to provide the court with some figures in that regard.
Iran celebrates an Oscar win — and a chance to needle President Trump  [SEP]  Iranians delighted Monday in the Oscar victory by director Asghar Farhadi, who won his second foreign language film award but boycotted the ceremony in protest of President Trump’s immigration policies. Farhadi, who won for his drama “The Salesman,” had an Iranian American engineer — Anousheh Ansari, the first Iranian-born person to travel to space — deliver a statement on his behalf condemning Trump’s “inhumane” executive order banning citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iran, from entering the U.S. “Dividing the world into the ‘us’ and ‘our enemies’ categories creates fear — a deceitful justification for aggression and war,” Farhadi wrote. “These wars prevent democracy and human rights in countries which have themselves been victims of aggression.” Iran’s theocratic regime and military establishment are accused of human rights abuses, supporting foreign extremist groups and curbing free speech. But Tehran seized an opportunity with the Oscar win to stake out some moral high ground over the United States. Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, tweeted, “Proud of cast & crew of ‘The Salesman’ for Oscar & stance against #MuslimBan.” Iranian state media gave scant coverage to the Oscar news, but many Iranians learned of Farhadi’s victory — which followed his 2012 triumph in the same category for the film “A Separation” — through social media. Farhadi had announced in January that he wouldn’t attend the ceremony. On Friday he joined the directors of the four other Oscar-nominated foreign language films — from Denmark, Germany, Australia and Sweden — in issuing a statement expressing “our unanimous and emphatic disapproval of the climate of fanaticism and nationalism we see today in the U.S. and in so many other countries.” Hours before the ceremony on Sunday, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, a Muslim, held a free public screening of “The Salesman” that drew thousands. Khan has called Trump’s travel ban “shameful.” The travel order has been held up in court. Trump has singled out Iran for criticism since taking office, ordering fresh sanctions following an Iranian missile test and threatening to reconsider a nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, including the United States, that has eased economic restrictions against the Islamic republic. For many Iranians, who have reacted with a mixture of fear and contempt to Trump’s harsh rhetoric, Farhadi’s victory was a moment to celebrate. “The Oscar for ‘The Salesman’ shows the world of art is beyond man-made frontiers, with an emphasis on humanity,” said Rahim Zohabi, a 65-year-old businessman in Tehran. “Art cannot be limited by bans and walls. Hopefully [the Oscar] will promote peace and understanding between nations, if not politicians.” The film centers on an Iranian couple — actors starring in a local production of Arthur Miller’s play “The Salesman” — whose life is upended when the woman is assaulted by an intruder. Some hardliners criticized the film for presenting a negative image of Iran. Others speculated that Iranian authorities submitted the film for Oscar consideration in an attempt to show a humane side to the theocracy — and that Farhadi was rewarded by a liberal Hollywood for his opposition to Trump. “The award was politicized,” said Farshid Farivar, a 54-year-old publisher of art magazines. “‘The Salesman’ didn’t deserve the Oscar.” Ahmad Kassaeian, an optician and writer, said Iranians worldwide would cheer the success of one of their own. “I think Mr. Farhadi cannot make any tangible impact in reducing the tension between Iran and America,” said Kassaeian, 54. “But culturally, if we gain greater recognition and respect among Americans, that’s important.” Special correspondent Mostaghim reported from Tehran and Times staff writer Bengali from Thiruvananthapuram, India.

German official: Dortmund attack suspect acted out of greed  [SEP]  BERLIN (AP) A 28-year-old German-Russian citizen was arrested Friday in Germany on suspicion of bombing the bus carrying the Borussia Dortmund soccer team in an attack last week that officials alleged was motivated by financial greed. A Dortmund player and a policeman were injured in the triple blasts last week as the bus was heading to the team’s stadium for a Champions League match against AS Monaco. Investigators found notes at the scene claiming responsibility on behalf of Islamic extremists, but quickly doubted their authenticity. Federal prosecutors said the suspect, identified only as Sergej W. in keeping with German privacy law, was arrested by a police tactical response team early Friday in or near the southwestern city of Tuebingen. The man faces charges of attempted murder, causing an explosion and serious bodily harm. Prosecutors said they planned to make a statement later Friday, but revealed that the suspect had taken out a loan and bought a large number of so-called put options for shares of Borussia Dortmund, betting on a drop in the share price. ”A significant share price drop could have been expected if a player had been seriously injured or even killed as a result of the attack,” they said. Ralf Jaeger, the top security official in North Rhine-Westphalia state, said the suspect had hoped to earn millions ”The man appears to have wanted to commit murder out of greed,” said Jaeger. Prosecutors said they were able to trace the computer used to purchase the put options to the luxury hotel in Dortmund where the team had been staying. They said W. had also booked a room there and placed three explosives, packed with shrapnel, along the route the bus would take to reach the stadium. ”The explosive devices were detonated at the optimum time,” prosecutors said, noting that the team bus was equipped only with security glass and not reinforced glass. Several windows on the bus were shattered in the blasts, injuring defender Marc Bartra. A police officer accompanying the bus also suffered trauma from the blast. After the three identical notes claiming responsibility for the attack were found at the scene investigators initially considered the possibility that it might have been the work of Islamic extremists. The notes demanded that Germany withdraw reconnaissance jets assisting the fight against Islamic State group and close the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany. But experts said the letter’s mix of correct, complicated German and obvious mistakes suggested it was a red herring – as were two subsequent claims pointing to left-wing and right-wing extremists. Still, a 26-year-old Iraqi man detained after the attack was ordered held on suspicion of membership of IS. The man, identified only as Abdul Beset A., allegedly led a unit of about 10 IS fighters involved in preparing kidnappings, extortions and killings in Iraq, before traveling to Germany in early 2016.
Three killed after magnitude 6.3 quake off Java and Bali  [SEP]  Three people were killed and houses were damaged after a magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck off East Java province and Bali at around 2am on Thursday (Oct 11). Not much damage, however, was reported, the Indonesian government said. The three victims were residents of Sumenep, East Java, and were asleep when their house nearly collapsed after the shallow quake, 12km underground, Indonesian disaster management agency (BNPB) said in a statement. The United States Geological Survey recorded the quake as having a magnitude of 6.0. The quake’s epicentre was 55km north-east of East Java. Indonesia's most populous Java island is right next to the main tourist island of Bali, where the International Monetary Fund and World Bank annual meetings are being held this week. "The quake didn't trigger any tsunami for sure," Ms Dwikorita Karnawati, head of Indonesia’s meteorology, climatology and geophysics agency (BMKG), told AFP. "Wow, that was really strong and it lasted a long time," AFP reported, citing a woman named Davy who took refuge in the carpark of a Bali hotel, several kilometres from the IMF-World Bank meetings' venue. AFP reported that some guests at hotels in Nusa Dua, south of Bali's main international airport, briefly fled outside after the strong tremor shook the building. Most affected areas, however, were in Sumenep, East Java, which were exposed to higher tremors felt from the quake – and residents felt the tremors for between two seconds and five seconds – due to its closer proximity to the epicentre. Bali received less tremors. 3 orang meninggal dunia, 4 orang luka dan beberapa rumah rusak di Kabupaten Semenep akibat gempa M6,3 yang mengguncang wilayah Jawa Timur dan Bali. Pusat gempa di 61 km timur laut Situbondo pada kedalaman 10 km. Tidak berpotensi tsunami. pic.twitter.com/xAQ6wij6tC — Sutopo Purwo Nugroho (@Sutopo_PN) October 10, 2018 About 25 minutes ago yet another earthquake in Indonesia -- 6.0 magnitude 193 km E of #Surabaya (#Indonesia). But was strong enough to wake up everyone in our hotel in Bali. pic.twitter.com/DSij0RNp3p — Ahmed Shihab-Eldin (@ASE) October 10, 2018 Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, making it vulnerable to earthquakes as well as volcanic eruptions. "Based on our analysis of the earthquake map, its corresponding intensity was felt between III and IV Modified Mercalli Intensity scale (MMI), or between light and moderate. Generally, there is not much damage impact from the quake," Dr Sutopo said in the statement. Last month, a magnitude 7.4 earthquake in Central Sulawesi killed more than 2,000 people and destroyed tens of thousands of houses. This came after earthquakes in Lombok, east of Bali, killed more than 500 in August. Residents in the affected areas in Central Sulawesi were exposed to intensity VI-VII MMI. “Intensity IV MMI could cause doors, windows to produce cracking sound. Intensity III would feel like you are near a passing truck,” Ms Dwikorita told Elshinta radio. “Intensity V could cause most of the items in a house to sway, with some of them falling on the floor. Intensity VI could cause a wall, part of a house to collapse,” she added. She explained that serious damage to houses would normally occur only at intensities above V MMI, but it is not always so in many cases in Indonesia because of the poor construction quality and design. Besides a quake’s magnitude, corresponding intensity and how strong the ground the house is built on are key factors affecting the impact in the aftermath, Ms Dwikorita also said in a phone interview with Elshinta radio. BMKG recorded 13 aftershocks within five hours of the quake, with the magnitude on a declining trend. The latest recorded aftershock was a magnitude 2.5 at 6.50am local time. “The quake has no tsunami potential. Residents should not panic or rush to higher ground,” Ms Dwikorita added. The Straits Times understands that Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs is closely monitoring the situation in Indonesia. No Singaporeans have been affected by the earthquake so far.

1 Dead, 19 Injured as Car Plows Into Pedestrians in s Square  [SEP]  One person was killed and 19 others were hurt Thursday when a car driving through Times Square in New York City slammed into pedestrians, the New York City Fire Department said. The car's driver, a 26-year-old, was taken into custody at the scene of the crash, the NYPD said. The driver, who has a history of DWI arrests, appeared to have been intoxicated with drugs or alcohol, the NYPD told the New York Times . Law enforcement is testing the driver for alcohol while in custody, the Associated Press reported . The conditions of those injured were not known, officials said. NYPD believes it was an isolated incident. An investigation is currently underway. “There was like blood everywhere. Really terrifying,” one witness told CBS New York. “We kept looking at ourselves, like, ‘What can we do?’” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio arrived on the scene in Times Square after the crash. President Donald Trump has been briefed on the incident, White House press secretary Sean Spicer tweeted . One of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, more than 300,000 people pass through Times Square each day.
Democrats' Next Phase in Kavanaugh Onslaught Revealed  [SEP]  Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh may keep facing political attacks from the left if he is confirmed to the nation’s highest court. Kavanaugh faced an onslaught of attacks from Democrats and liberal activists even before Palo Alto University professor Christine Blasey Ford accused him of drunkenly trying to force himself on her while the two were in high school. Kavanaugh emphatically denied Ford’s accusation in an emotional testimony on Thursday. Brian Fallon, former press secretary on Hillary Clinton’s unsuccessful 2016 presidential campaign, predicted that Kavanaugh “will not serve for life” if confirmed to the Supreme Court. Fallon leads Demand Justice, a Democratic dark money group dedicated to opposing Kavanaugh’s confirmation, and previously called for Kavanaugh to be impeached from his current position on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. “If Senate GOP ignores Dr. Blasey Ford and tries to muscle an attempted rapist onto the Supreme Court: 1. They will pay dearly this November. 2. Senators up in 2020 (Collins, Gardner et al) will feel intense heat for next two years. 3. Kavanaugh will not serve for life,” Fallon predicted. Some congressional Democrats are already pledging to investigate Kavanaugh if they retake Congress with him sitting on the Supreme Court. Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Senate Judiciary Committee member, pledged to investigate Kavanaugh “as soon as Democrats get the gavel.” “This is such bad practice that even if they were to ram this guy through, as soon as Democrats get gavels we’re going to want to get to the bottom of this,” Whitehouse told CNN on Sept. 20. “His background is fair for consideration, both before he is confirmed and, if he should be confirmed, we would be duty-bound to follow-up on any blemishes on his record that were not fully discovered prior to his confirmation,” Democratic Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson told The Intercept on Wednesday. “We would owe that to the American people.” Democratic California Rep. Ted Lieu “would need more information” before weighing in on Kavanaugh’s impeachment, he told The Daily Caller News Foundation in a private Twitter message on Thursday. Lieu noted he hasn’t “heard Mark Judge or the other accusers questioned under oath” but didn’t rule out supporting impeachment. One of Lieu’s fellow California Democrats, Rep. Eric Swalwell, previously floated the possibility of a “judicial impeachment” in the event that Kavanaugh is confirmed. “If the Republicans rush through a nominee where you have unanswered sexual assault allegations, I can promise you that Democratic senators will be interested in going and looking at those allegations, and if Judge Kavanaugh lied under oath, you could see a judicial impeachment, and that’s not good for anybody, so we should try and avoid that,” Swalwell told Fox News in a Sept. 22 interview. Liberal activists and journalists on Thursday predicted a push to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed and Democrats retake Congress. RELATED: Democrats Stomp Out of Kavanaugh Hearing After Motion Gets Voted Down Kavanaugh slammed Senate Democrats’ no-holds-barred campaign to stop his nomination in his statement before the judiciary committee on Thursday. “This confirmation process has become a national disgrace,” Kavanaugh said. “The Constitution gives the Senate an important role in the confirmation process, but you have replaced ‘with advice and consent’ with ‘search and destroy.'” “What you want to do is destroy this guy’s life, hold this seat open, and hope you win in 2020,” Graham said. He went on to call the entire process “the most unethical sham since I’ve been in politics.” Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Scores feared dead after plane crashes in southern Iran  [SEP]  An Iranian commercial plane has crashed in a foggy, mountainous region of southern Iran, killing all 66 people on board, state media reported. An Iranian commercial plane has crashed in a foggy, mountainous region of southern Iran, killing all 66 people on board, state media reported. An Aseman Airlines ATR-72, a twin-engine turboprop used for short-distance regional flying, went down near its destination of the southern Iranian city of Yasuj, some 485 miles south of the Iranian capital, Tehran. “After searching the area, we learned that unfortunately … our dear passengers had lost their lives,” Mr Tabatabai said. “This plane had 60 passengers, 59 adults and one child, as well as a pilot, a co-pilot, two flight attendants and two air marshals on board.” Due to foggy conditions, rescue helicopters could not reach the crash site in the Zagros Mountains, state TV reported. Mr Tabatabai said the plane crashed into Mount Dena, which is about 4,400 meters (14,435 feet) tall. Aseman Airlines, owned by Iran’s civil service pension foundation, is a semi-private air carrier headquartered in Tehran that specialises in flights to remote airfields across the country. It also flies internationally. It is Iran’s third-largest airline by fleet size, behind state carrier Iran Air and Mahan Air. However, Aseman Airlines is banned from flying in the European Union over safety concerns. The carrier has a fleet of 29 aircraft, including six ATR aircraft, according to FlightRadar24, a plane-tracking website. The ATR-72 that crashed had been built in 1993, Aseman Airlines CEO Ali Abedzadeh told state TV. The plane took off from Tehran at 0433 GMT and gave its last signal at 0555 GMT, when the flight was at 16,975 feet and was descending, FlightRadar24 said. Aseman Airlines has suffered other major crashes with deaths. In October 1994, a twin-propeller Fokker F-28 1,000 commuter plane flown by the airline crashed near Natanz, 180 miles south of Tehran, also killing 66 people on board. An Aseman Airlines chartered flight in August 2008, flown by an Itek Air Boeing 737, crashed in Kyrgyzstan, killing 74 people. The Iranian Red Crescent said it has deployed to the area. Authorities said they would be investigating. Locals described hearing the crash, though no one had found the crash site yet, according to state TV. European airplane manufacturer ATR, a Toulouse, France-based partnership of Airbus and Italy’s Leonardo SpA, said it had no immediate information about the crash. The manufacturer specialises in regional turboprop aircraft of 90 seats or fewer. Under decades of international sanctions, Iran’s commercial passenger aircraft fleet has aged, with air accidents occurring regularly in recent years. Following the 2015 landmark nuclear deal with world powers, Iran signed deals with both Airbus and Boeing to buy scores of passenger planes worth tens of billions of dollars. US politicians have expressed concern about the airplane sales to Iran. US President Donald Trump remains sceptical of the atomic accord overall and has refused to re-certify it, putting the deal in question.
Attorney General Sessions to visit Guantanamo Bay prison  [SEP]  Attorney General Jeff Sessions is visiting Guantanamo Bay Friday in a show of support for the prison he has called a fine place to detain new terrorism suspects, as opposed to having them prosecuted by the Justice Department in U.S. courts. Sessions is traveling to the detention facility in Cuba with his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, to gain "an up-to-date understanding of current operations," Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior said. They will "meet with the people on the ground who are leading our government-wide efforts" there. It is Sessions' first trip there since becoming attorney general. "Recent attacks in Europe and elsewhere confirm that the threat to our nation is immediate and real, and it remains essential that we use every lawful tool available to prevent as many attacks as possible," Prior said. Sessions has long been a vocal supporter of the continued use of Guantanamo, calling it a "very fine place for holding these kind of dangerous criminals." "We've spent a lot of money fixing it up," Sessions told the conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt in a March interview. "And I'm inclined to the view that it remains a perfectly acceptable place. And I think the fact that a lot of the criticisms have just been totally exaggerated." The support for Guantanamo now represents a complete reversal of eight years of efforts to close it. The Obama administration sent no new detainees there, and though it didn't fulfill a promise to shut it down, whittled the population from 242 to 41. Obama's Justice Department maintained that the U.S. civilian court system was the most legally sound forum in which to prosecute terror suspects captured in the U.S. and overseas and cited hundreds of convictions in New York and other cities as proof. Former Attorney General Eric Holder sought unsuccessfully in 2009 to move the suspected ringleader of the Sept. 11 attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, from Guantanamo to New York for trial, and though the plan was derailed by political opposition, has since expressed vindication as the military tribunal system at Guantanamo stalled.
CNN host humiliates former GOP senator for claiming any good news about Obamacare is ‘fake’  [SEP]  CNN host Carol Costello on Wednesday hammered former Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC), who now works at the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation. During an interview DeMint accused Obamacare of being “unworkable and unaffordable,” with a chance of destabilizing the market. He said he was encouraged by the GOP’s efforts to repeal the law and ensure health care was “available to every American.” That’s when Costello nailed DeMint with some difficult questions. “It seems that Mr. [Donald] Trump, wants a replacement plan before it’s repealed, as you suggested,” she began. “This is what he said on ’60 minutes’ back in December, and I’m going to quote him. He said, ‘This is an un-Republican thing for me to say, I’m going to take care of everybody. I don’t care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody is going to be taken care of much better than they’re taken care of now.’ That sounds an awful lot like Obamacare, except he’s not calling it that.” DeMint claimed that Americans aren’t being taken care of now, rather they’re “just been pushed onto Medicaid.” “So, how do you take care of people much better than they’re taken care of now? How can everybody be covered, and Donald Trump added that the government would pay for that?” Costello asked. DeMint struggled to answer. “Well, we know that you can — we never needed a new health care system. We needed to make it more affordable and available,” he said, before bashing the law again. He urged Congress to pass a law that offers everyone private insurance that is more affordable. “So, the insurance companies will just go along with that?” Costello asked. DeMint said that unless the companies want to go out of business, they’ll have to offer affordable plans. “What we have to do is create competition,” he explained. He said that Trump will do that, as well as “create a vibrant insurance market.” Costello wondered who has that plan and why no plan has been proposed by the GOP in the last several years. DeMint explained that the last thing America needed was another 200-page comprehensive bill, but declared that he wanted to make the existing system work better. Costello agreed that there are problems, but said there are still positives to the law. “For example, this is according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office: Preventive care paid for by Obamacare saves health care costs overall. The typical price increase before Obamacare was around 3 to 4 percent. Obamacare will lower the deficit by $143 billion over the next ten years. So, there are pluses to Obamacare. So, how do you keep the pluses and get rid of the minuses?” she asked. DeMint called those facts things that could fall “under the category of fake news.” Costello corrected him, noting that they were from the Congressional Budget Office, which scores all the financial information for such bills on both sides of the aisle. He insisted those numbers weren’t real. “So, all of those 20 million people enrolled in Obamacare, they’re all going broke and it’s not working for any of them?” she asked. DeMint struggled again, claiming that only 2 to 3 million Americans didn’t have health insurance before Obamacare. The uninsured rate actually peaked at 18 percent before the individual mandate went into effect, according to Gallup. That’s significantly more than just 2 to 3 million people. Yet, DeMint explained that even those uninsured who are now insured are suffering under Obamacare. “Even those Americans who are on Obamacare, who have catastrophic illnesses like cancer?” she asked. He claimed cancer was covered by private insurance. “What if you can’t afford private insurance?” she persisted. “Because it ain’t cheap. Unless you get it through your employer, which most Americans still do, by the way.” DeMint, again, claimed the GOP plan would make care more affordable and more available to every American. The president-elect spent the last two years talking about repealing and replacing Obamacare. House Republicans have voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act over 80 times. Yet, Republicans have never agreed on an alternative plan that achieves the same goal but is acceptable to their party and the insurance agencies. In 1989, The Heritage Foundation was the author of the individual mandate that has been critical in getting insurance companies to being comfortable with the law. In the early 1990s, a Republican plan emerged that ultimately didn’t garner a lot of Republican support. President Obama has urged Republicans to simply change the name to “Trumpcare” so that they’ll be comfortable with the law and making sure people are covered. Some pundits have even assumed that the GOP will change a few small things with the law and rebrand it exactly that way so that they can take credit for the law Obama and Democrats passed.

Aaron Hernandez’s brain is being held ‘illegally,’ attorney says  [SEP]  MASSACHUSETTS — The family of Aaron Hernandez plans to donate his brain to scientists to determine whether he had Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, the degenerative brain disease linked to a number of NFL athletes. But the brain is being held “illegally” by the Massachusetts Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Hernandez family attorney Jose Baez said on Thursday. “It is our position that they are holding Aaron Hernandez’s brain illegally,” he said. “They have released the body and withheld Aaron’s brain.” The brain custody battle comes a day after prison officials said Hernandez, a former NFL star for the New England Patriots, hanged himself with a bedsheet attached to a window in his prison cell. Hernandez, 27, was serving a sentence of life without parole for the June 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd. His death came less than a week after he was acquitted in a separate double-murder trial. Baez, who has been retained by the Hernandez family to investigate his death, said he may take the medical examiner’s office to court. Hernandez’s body is at Faggas Funeral Home in Watertown, Massachusetts, according to funeral home secretary Jennifer Smith. Baez said the family made arrangements for the Boston University CTE Unit to take possession of the brain, and the medical examiner’s office agreed to those plans. “The family of Aaron Hernandez has decided to donate to this study so that we could possibly help other young men who decide to play football, and to help further that cause, and also possibly shed light and more evidence on this case,” Baez said. However, the medical examiner’s office changed its mind, Baez said, and it plans to do the examination and the fixing procedure of the brain. “The family does not have confidence in this medical examiner’s office, specifically given the history of this case, the history of missing evidence, the history of misconduct, and the issues that came out in this trial of certain things that were done by the medical examiner’s office which did not follow proper protocols,” Baez said. The Boston University CTE Center, led by Dr. Ann McKee, has found evidence of CTE in the brains of 200 people, including in high school and professional football players. The degenerative disease is believed to be caused by repeated head trauma, and has been found in famed NFL players including Junior Seau and Dave Duerson. Scientists can only diagnose the disease after death. “It is our policy that we do not and cannot discuss any ongoing, completed or potential case(s) without specific consent from the family,” the center said. Baez said he was not suggesting Hernandez had CTE. He said the CTE center was one of the finest in the country, whereas the medical examiner’s office did not have the protocols in place to properly examine the brain. “This is not amateur hour, and the medical examiner’s office shouldn’t decide to play amateur hour,” he said. “It is literally a destruction of evidence issue, and that is the problem here.”
New tropical storm forms over eastern Pacific Ocean  [SEP]  MEXICO CITY (AP) — A newly formed tropical storm is blowing over the eastern Pacific, far off the coast of Mexico. The U.S. National Hurricane Center says Tropical Storm Hector is likely to grow to hurricane force, but it poses no threat to land. The storm was centered about 905 miles (1,455 kilometers) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula early Wednesday and it was moving toward the west-northwest at 15 mph (24 kph). It had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph).
Ten new moons—including one ‘oddball’—discovered around Jupiter  [SEP]  Ten new moons—including one ‘oddball’—discovered around Jupiter Jupiter’s orbital family has just rapidly expanded, with scientists today announcing the discovery of 10 new miniature moons around the gas giant. That brings its total known satellites to 79, the most in the solar system. The new moons, pictured as circles above, were discovered last year by a team of astronomers. After verification, they are being reported today by the International Astronomical Union, based in Paris. At the time, the researchers were searching for a theorized massive planet far beyond Pluto, known as Planet X or Planet Nine, which is thought to be tugging on the orbits of distant solar system objects. Although the scientists’ planet hunt has so far come up dry, the team, using the recently upgraded Blanco 4-meter telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, also had Jupiter in view, leading to the discovery. Additional observations over a year confirmed the orbits of the moons, all of which are 3 kilometers or less in diameter. The moonlets mostly follow Jupiter’s known patterns: Located far beyond the planet’s large primary moons (purple), two of the new moonlets belong to a grouping (blue) that spins in the same direction as the planet, all of which are believed to be the fragments of one large shattered moon. Seven fall in a farther out “retrograde” cluster (red) rotating against the planet’s spin, their opposing path kick-started when ancient moons collided with comets, asteroids, or other moons. But one moon, tentatively dubbed “Valetudo” (green), is an oddball, orbiting with Jupiter’s spin but within the retrograde cluster. The satellite, named for Jupiter’s great-granddaughter, could be a bit of unfinished business, the last remnant of the ancient moons that provided the grist for the retrograde cluster, the team theorizes. Its path weaving within the retrograde moons is unstable, they add; a collision, at some point, is likely. *Correction, 17 July, 10:30 a.m: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of new moons discovered. Although the team did discover 12 new moons, two were announced last year.
Has there ever been a more exciting Grey Cup game?  [SEP]  TORONTO — If you believe in karma, you felt the Redblacks had a very good chance to pull off one of the greatest upsets in CFL history all along. If only because of where the 104th Grey Cup game was played. The last seven times it was held at Exhibition Stadium, which is now BMO Field, the results either a positive Ottawa twist or a negative Calgary twist or both. The winning coach in the last three (1982, 1980, 1978) was Rick Campbell’s dad, Hugh. In 1973, Ottawa defensive end Charlie Brandon was the MVP in a 22-18 win over Edmonton. And in 1968, Ottawa was a 24-21 winner over Calgary. This was brought to my attention by superb play-by- play man Chris Cuthbert Sunday morning. He also shared a conversation he had with Rick Campbell last week. “I reminded him his dad lost the first one and then won five in a row,” said Cuthbert, who called his 18th Grey Cup game Sunday night. “And that he also lost his first one.” If you believe in karma, you’re thinking the Redblacks could be just starting a very special run. Has there ever been a more exciting Grey Cup game? Can’t imagine … Earlier in the week, Henry Burris left some doubt as to whether he would be back next season, suggesting this game could be his “last hurrah”. A performance like he had Sunday might be the perfect time to walk away, except how could he when there exists the possibility to play in a Grey Cup game in Ottawa next November? My money says Burris will be back in ’17 … What, in overtime of the Grey Cup game you forgot Ernest Jackson doesn’t drop the ball? … Attendance was announced as 33,421 and declared a “capacity crowd.” But there sure looked to be a lot of empty seats on a night that no one would have stayed home because of the weather … When Brad Sinopoli rolled over a body to score a nine-yard TD with 11:21 to go in the third quarter, the follow-up convert put the Redblacks up 27-7. As great as the Stamps are, it just didn’t feel like they had a chance to come back from that … Is there anybody other than Sinopoli you would want to have an onside kick go to? Maybe Ernest Jackson, but after that? … Two years, two Grey Cup game, two costly fourth quarter pass interference penalties for Abdul Kanneh … Kanneh did make up for the one Sunday night, however, with an incredible diving tackle of Calgary QB Andrew Buckley to prevent the go-ahead TD with less than 20 seconds left in regulation time … I don’t care what the explanation is, when Stamps DB Joshua Bell stunned Khalil Paden with a flagrant and vicious helmet-on-helmet hit, there should have been a penalty called. A flag would have been thrown if that happened in the NFL, for sure … The guy that made the spectacular one handed catch at Friday’s practice, Juron Criner, made a couple of huge fourth quarter receptions Sunday night … How is it possible that not a single Redblack was able to even one-hand-touch DaVaris Daniels as he scored on a 19-yard run late in the fourth quarter? After the discipline problems they had for much of the season, the Redblacks didn’t take their first penalty Sunday until 4:43 of the second quarter, when centre Jon Gott was flagged for holding. On the very next play they gave up their first sack of the day. Maybe they should have tried to get away with holding again … The first two big plays by the Redblacks offence were 21-yard Burris-to-Greg Ellingson gains. The next drive saw a 21-yarder to Jackson. If you were watching from the Casino du Lac-Leamy in Gatineau, Que., you must have been a couple of chips on 21 at that point … Redblacks DB Forrest Hightower made a great catch on his second quarter interception then celebrated like it was no big deal. It was just the third pick of his CFL career, all coming in the last six weeks … Mitchell White dropped what should have been another interception the next time MOP Bo Levi Mitchell threw the ball …. Redblacks DB Jeff Richards looked like he was camping under a long and lazy fly ball when he intercepted Mitchell a few minutes later … The biggest pick of all, however, was Hightower’s second of the game, with Ottawa up by 10 and just over three minutes left on the clock … Bo doesn’t know many bad nights, but on this one he was horrible. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau delivered a pre-game message on the end zone video board. Perhaps he wouldn’t have been booed had he shown up and kicked the ball like his old man … Minus that rogue Remigio Pereira, this time The Tenors pulled off the anthem without a hitch … How loud is the horn at Air Canada Centre that sounds when the Maple Leafs score or win? We could hear it on the 29th floor of the building three blocks away … Neon digits on the yard sticks made the numbers much easier to see. Who knew? … Never has there been a louder groan from a press box than when Burris just missed Khalil Paden with a bomb off a flea flicker early in the third quarter….

Don Chevrier was such a great and diverse broadcaster everyone just assumed he was a member of the Football Reporters of Canada Hall of Fame. Except he wasn’t, at least not until Sunday morning. “It really is surreal this is happening now,” TSN broadcaster Chris Cuthbert said at the annual FRC breakfast before presenting the induction plaque to Jeff Chevrier, whose father passed away in 2007 at the age of 69. “Two years ago I was fortunate enough to be inducted, and in processing it all I spent some time kind of reflecting on all of the great names that had been here before me. “I kept scanning the list for Don Chevrier’s name because he was my broadcast idol, and I couldn’t find it. I just thought it must be a mistake. I finally realized that somehow, unbelievably, that Don Chevrier’s name was not on the Hall of Fame list. “My guess is it was so impressive, all of his achievements, in multiple sports, radio and TV networks, across North America in a remarkable 52-year career, that either the selection committee at the time had taken for granted, as I did, that Don was already in, or that maybe just that his football work had been overshadowed by his endless string of achievements in other venues.” Chevrier, who was born in Toronto, started out in radio and worked at a number of stations across the country, including CFRA. “It’s fitting Ottawa is in the Grey Cup the year of Don’s induction, as his work coincided with the glory years of Ottawa football,” said Cuthbert. “His first Grey Cup call was in 1969, Russ Jackson’s final game. Russ would later become his analyst on CBC telecasts. “For four decades, on radio and TV, Don Chevrier called the Canadian Football League in its golden era, and as Brian Willams so aptly described it, called it with the voice of God.” Chevrier also called the first Blue Jays game and did play-by-play for Ottawa Senators. His talents also took him abroad for the Olympics and to the U.S. for the Kentucky Derby and heavy weight title fights. “He rode shotgun with Howard Cosell,” said Cuthbert. “After working with Don for the first time, Howard asked ‘are all Canadian sportscasters as Don Chevrier?’ Well, the answer then, as it is now, is that few anywhere are in Chevy’s league.” Defensive back Abdul Kanneh was desperate to make up for his mistake. And receiver Ernest Jackson was determined to stay with a ball that was getting away from him. Together, they saved a game that was getting away from the Redblacks. Together, they played leading rolls as Ottawa pulled off a stunning 39-33 overtime victory over the Calgary Stampeders in Sunday’s Grey Cup game. Kanneh, whose pass interference penalty late in the final minute of the fourth quarter, made a diving tackle on quarterback Andrew Buckley to prevent Calgary from scoring what would have almost certainly been the game winning touchdown. “I had to make a play. I messed up the play before and I gave myself another chance. It was a all or nothing,” said Kanneh. “I said to myself, ‘dive, it’s all or nothing, if you don’t dive, it’s game over with. And it’s going to be on you.’” Asked how close he came to missing Buckley’s foot, Kanneh said: “It’s all about the shoelaces baby.” “It’s been a long road, ups and downs, a lot of adversity a lot of people kicking us down,” added Kanneh. “They’ve been thinking we suck, thinking we’re not good enough. Thinking ‘Oh, Calgary is going to come in here and stomp on us.’ But we came in and stampeded on the Stampeders.” While Kanneh got the Redblacks to overtime, Jackson put them over the hump with his 18-yard TD reception in overtime. Jackson, the East Division’s nominee for Most Outstanding Player, was praised at the end of the regular season for not dropping a single pass. He almost lost the OT ball thrown by Henry Burris, however, but after bobbling it a couple of times Jackson regained control.“I snapped it off and I was so open, I was thinking touchdown before I caught the ball,” said Jackson. “I turned and looked up field, but I didn’t have the ball. It wasn’t really in my hands. I bobbled it and just kept my eyes on it, stayed focused until the end zone.”
Jamal Khashoggi was strangled, body dismembered, Turkish prosecutor says  [SEP]  Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was strangled to death and his body dismembered soon after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, the Istanbul prosecutor's office said Wednesday. Khashoggi's body parts were disposed of after being dismembered, the office said in a report obtained by Turkey's Anadolu news agency. The report appears to confirm media reports that have been coming out of Turkey since Khashoggi's death. "The body of Khashoggi has been dismembered after being killed in the Saudi Consulate," the office said in a statement. Saudi officials provided no information on any "local collaborator" involved in the killing of Khashoggi, the statement added. Media outlets have quoted a Saudi official as saying the body had been given to someone for disposal. Saudi prosecutor Saud Al Mojeb arrived in Istanbul Sunday for talks Monday and Tuesday with Istanbul’s chief prosecutor, İrfan Fidan, Turkish media reported. Mojeb toured the consulate Tuesday. Khashoggi disappeared in early October after entering the consulate to obtain documents in preparation for his marriage. Video footage showed Khashoggi entering, but no video ever showed him leaving. For weeks Saudi Arabia denied any knowledge of Khashoggi's fate, saying he had left the consulate shortly after entering. The disappearance and subsequent reports that Khashoggi had been tortured and killed drew international outrage. The Saudis ultimately gave some ground, saying Khashoggi died after a fight that broke out during his interrogation. The regime said 18 people had been arrested in the incident. The Istanbul Prosecutor's Office said it had requested the extradition of the suspects held by Saudi Arabia. Khashoggi, a Saudi and contributor for the Washington Post, had drawn the ire of his government for repeated criticisms of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's defacto leader, of King Salman, and of Saudi involvement in the war in Yemen. The prince last week called the killing a “heinous” crime and vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. President Donald Trump has taken the Saudis to task for the "total fiasco" and their lack of transparency. But he also expressed support for the kingdom's ruling family. And he has rejected calls to cancel a $110 billion arms deal, saying such a move would only hurt the United States while aiding Russia and China. Khashoggi's son, Salah, left Saudi Arabia last week after the Saudis revoked his travel ban. Saudi Arabia had banned him from leaving the country several months ago amid his father's criticism of the Crown Prince. The Saudi decision to let the younger Khashoggi leave came after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's recent visit to Riyadh where he "made it clear" that Washington wanted him free to leave the kingdom, U.S. State Department spokesman Robert Palladino said.
President Trump's travel ban is back at the Supreme Court  [SEP]  WASHINGTON — It didn't take long for the Supreme Court's decision on President Trump's travel ban to reach the ... Supreme Court. But the latest battle isn't over whether travelers from predominantly Muslim nations can be barred from entering the United States, or which countries are included. It's about picking and choosing who can get in and who must stay out. The Justice Department asked a federal appeals court Saturday to block a federal district judge's ruling Thursday allowing more immigrants and refugees into the country. By changing the government's interpretation of the Supreme Court's June 26 decision, which partially restored the travel ban after a series of lower court defeats, the department argued that the latest order invites "precisely the type of uncertainty and confusion that the government has worked diligently to prevent." The administration also asked the Supreme Court late Friday to clarify its June ruling by allowing the more stringent requirements on travelers that the government had imposed. The justices gave lawyers for Hawaii, which initiated the challenge, until Tuesday to respond. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas had predicted this next round of court battles when the high court partially restored the controversial travel ban after a series of lower court decisions against it. The justices said only immigrants and refugees with a "bona fide" connection to the U.S. can be exempt. "The compromise ... will invite a flood of litigation until this case is finally resolved," Thomas wrote. Federal district court Judge Derrick Watson ruled Thursday that the Trump administration was "unduly restrictive" in implementing the ban by allowing only spouses, children, parents, siblings, fiancés and in-laws. Watson opened the door to grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, cousins and siblings-in-law. And while the administration decided only refugees already in contact with resettlement agencies could enter, Watson's ruling would allow for more. That led the Justice Department to ask Friday night for the Supreme Court's "immediate intervention" in the case, just 18 days after it blocked lower court rulings that put the travel ban on hold. "Only this court can definitively settle whether the government's reasonable implementation is consistent with this court's stay," the government argued in seeking to have the June 26 decision clarified. The court also had accepted the case for a more complete oral argument in the fall, in order to decide whether it violates the Constitution's protection of religion by targeting Muslims. That case, however, could become moot if the administration concludes its vetting procedures this summer. Watson's ruling on travelers from six countries — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — "empties the court's decision of meaning, as it encompasses not just close family members, but virtually all family members," the government said in seeking the justices' intervention. The judge's ruling on refugees, the administration argued, would apply to "every refugee permitted to enter the United States." Lawyers for Hawaii, which along with immigration rights groups had stymied Trump's efforts in courts across the nation, have until Tuesday to respond to the administration's request. strike down Watson's ruling or temporarily block it from increasing the flow of immigrants and refugees while it's appealed. Trump's order calls for a 90-day ban on entry to the U.S. from the six countries and a 120-day ban on admitting all refugees, in order to give the administration time to improve screening efforts to ensure terrorists do not sneak into the country. Watson's latest interpretation was being reviewed Friday by the State Department, which said it would would work with Justice Department lawyers to ensure "immediate implementation." Watson's ruling comes in the same week the U.S. admitted its 50,000th refugee for the 2017 fiscal year, reaching the annual cap established by Trump that is down from the 110,000 limit established by President Obama in his final year in office. That means the administration will stop accepting new refugees for the remainder of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. The only exceptions will be those with close family relationships as defined by the Supreme Court.
Iraqi forces begin operation to retake Tal Afar from IS  [SEP]  BAGHDAD — U.S.-backed Iraqi security forces on Sunday began a multi-pronged military operation to retake the town of Tal Afar, west of Mosul, from the Islamic State group, Iraq’s prime minister announced. Tal Afar and the surrounding area is one of the last pockets of IS-held territory in Iraq after victory was declared in July in Mosul, the country’s second-largest city. The town, about 150 kilometers (93 miles) east of the Syrian border, sits along a major road that was once a key IS supply route. “The city of Tal Afar will be liberated and will join all the liberated cities,” Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said in a televised speech to the nation broadcast on state television early Sunday. He was dressed in a black uniform of the type worn by Iraqi special forces. Al-Abadi said his message to IS was: “You either surrender or die.” By early afternoon, Lt. Gen. Abdul-Amir Rasheed Yar Allah, who commands the operation, said the forces had recaptured five villages east of town. In a statement, the U.S.-led coalition praised Iraqi security forces as a “capable, formidable, and increasingly professional force and they are well prepared to deliver another defeat” to IS in Tal Afar like in Mosul. “Mosul was a decisive victory for the Iraqi Security Forces, but it did not mark the end of (IS) in Iraq, or its worldwide threat,” said U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the commander of U.S. and Coalition forces in Iraq and Syria. The Coalition estimates that approximately 10,000-50,000 civilians remain in and around Tal Afar. Along with Tal Afar, IS militants are still fully in control of the town of Hawija west of Kirkuk, as well as the towns of Qaim, Rawa and Ana in western Iraq near the Syrian border. Tal Afar has been a stronghold for extremists in Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Many senior leaders al-Qaida in Iraq and IS were from Tal Afar. Iraq’s mostly Shiite militiamen largely stayed out of the operation to retake Mosul, a mostly Sunni city about 80 kilometers (50 miles) to the east, but have vowed to play a bigger role in the battle for Tal Afar, which was home to both Sunni and Shiite Turkmen before it fell to IS, a Sunni extremist group. The militias captured Tal Afar’s airport, on the outskirts of the town, last year. Their participation in the coming offensive could heighten sectarian and regional tensions. The town’s ethnic Turkmen community maintained close ties to neighboring Turkey. Turkish officials have expressed concern that once territory is liberated from IS, Iraqi Kurdish or Shiite forces may push out Sunni Arabs or ethnic Turkmen. A stepped up campaign of airstrikes and a troop buildup has already forced tens of thousands to flee Tal Afar, threatening to compound a humanitarian crisis sparked by the Mosul operation. Some 49,000 people have fled the Tal Afar district since April, according to the United Nations. Nearly a million people remain displaced by the nine-month campaign to retake Mosul.
Warning system might have saved lives in Indonesian tsunami  [SEP]  An early warning system that might have prevented some deaths in the tsunami that hit an Indonesian island on Friday has been stalled in the testing phase for years. MAKASSAR, Indonesia (AP) — An early warning system that might have prevented some deaths in the tsunami that hit an Indonesian island on Friday has been stalled in the testing phase for years. The high-tech system of seafloor sensors, data-laden sound waves and fiber-optic cable was meant to replace a system set up after an earthquake and tsunami killed nearly 250,000 people in the region in 2004. But inter-agency wrangling and delays in getting just 1 billion rupiah ($69,000) to complete the project mean the system hasn’t moved beyond a prototype developed with $3 million from the U.S. National Science Foundation. It is too late for central Sulawesi, where walls of water up to 6 meters (20 feet) high and a magnitude 7.5 earthquake killed at least 832 people in the cities of Palu and Donggala, tragically highlighting the weaknesses of the existing warning system and low public awareness about how to respond to warnings. “To me this is a tragedy for science, even more so a tragedy for the Indonesian people as the residents of Sulawesi are discovering right now,” said Louise Comfort, a University of Pittsburgh expert in disaster management who has led the U.S. side of the project, which also involves engineers from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and Indonesian scientists and disaster experts. “It’s a heartbreak to watch when there is a well-designed sensor network that could provide critical information,” she said. After a 2004 tsunami killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries, more than half of them in the Indonesian province of Aceh, a concerted international effort was launched to improve tsunami warning capabilities, particularly in the Indian Ocean and for Indonesia, one of world’s most earthquake and tsunami-prone countries. Part of that drive, using funding from Germany and elsewhere, included deploying a network of 22 buoys connected to seafloor sensors to transmit advance warnings. A sizeable earthquake off Sumatra island in 2016 that caused panic in the coastal city of Padang revealed that none of the buoys costing hundreds of thousands of dollars each were working. They’d been disabled by vandalism or theft or just stopped working due to a lack of funds for maintenance. The backbone of Indonesia’s tsunami warning system today is a network of 134 tidal gauge stations augmented by land-based seismographs, sirens in about 55 locations and a system to disseminate warnings by text message. When the 7.5 quake hit just after 6 p.m. Friday, the meteorology and geophysics agency issued a tsunami alert, warning of potential for waves of 0.5 to 3 meters (2 to 10 feet). It ended the warning at 6:36 p.m. That drew harsh online criticism, but the agency’s head said the warning was lifted after the tsunami hit. It’s unclear exactly what time tsunami waves rushed into the narrow bay that Palu is built around. “The tide gauges are operating, but they are limited in providing any advance warning. None of the 22 buoys are functioning,” Comfort said. “In the Sulawesi incident, BMKG (the meteorology and geophysics agency) canceled the tsunami warning too soon, because it did not have data from Palu. This is the data the tsunami detection system could provide.” Adam Switzer, a tsunami expert at the Earth Observatory of Singapore, said it’s a “little unfair” to say the agency got it wrong. “What it shows is that the tsunami models we have now are too simplistic,” he said. “They don’t take into account multiple events, multiple quakes within a short period of time. They don’t take into account submarine landslides.” Whatever system is in use, he said, the priority after an earthquake in a coastal area should be to get to higher ground and stay there for a couple of hours. Power outages after the earthquake struck meant that sirens meant to warn residents to evacuate did not work, said Harkunti P. Rahayu, an expert at the Institute of Technology in Bandung. “Most people were shocked by the earthquake and did not pay any thought that a tsunami will come,” she said. Experts say the prototype system deployed offshore from Padang — a city extremely vulnerable to tsunamis because it faces a major undersea fault overdue for a massive quake — can provide authoritative information about a tsunami threat within 1 to 3 minutes. That compares with 5 to 45 minutes from the now defunct buoys and the limited information provided by tidal gauges. The system’s undersea seismometers and pressure sensors send data-laden sound waves to warm surface waters. From there they refract back into the depths, traveling 20 to 30 kilometers (12 to 20 miles) to the next node in the network and so on. The Padang network’s final undersea point needs just a few more kilometers of fiber optic cable to connect it to a station on an offshore island where the cascades of data would be transmitted by satellite to the geophysics agency, which issues tsunami warnings, and to disaster officials. The Associated Press first reported on the system in January 2017, when the project was awaiting Indonesian funding to lay the cables. Since then, agencies involved have suffered budget cuts and the project bounced back and forth between them. A December 2017 quake off the coast of Java close to Jakarta reignited interest and the geophysics agency made getting funding a priority. In July, the Ministry of Finance in July approved funding to purchase and lay the cable. But at an inter-agency meeting in September, the three major agencies involved failed to agree on their responsibilities and the project was “simply put on hold,” Comfort said. Indonesian officials who’ve been supportive of the new early warning system did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Since the 2004 tsunami, the mantra among disaster officials in Indonesia has been that the earthquake is the tsunami warning and signal for immediate evacuation. Not everyone is convinced a tsunami detection system is essential. “What Indonesian colleagues have commented upon is that people were confused about what to do with the alert information,” said Gavin Sullivan, a Coventry University psychologist who works with the Indonesian Resilience Initiative on a disaster preparation project for the Indonesian city of Bandung. The fact that people were still milling around Palu’s shoreline when waves were visibly approaching shows the lessons of earlier disasters haven’t been absorbed. “This points to the failing to do appropriate training and to develop trust so that people know exactly what to do when an alert is issued,” he said. “In our project in Bandung, we’re finding a similar unwillingness to prepare for something that seems unlikely.” Associated Press writer Margie Mason in Jakarta, Indonesia, contributed to this report.

Dileep’s police custody extended till Saturday  [SEP]  A court on Friday extended till Saturday the police custody of popular Malayalam actor Dileep, arrested in connection with the alleged abduction and assault of a South Indian actress. The magistrate court in Angamalay granted police custody of the actor till 5 pm Saturday, partly allowing a prosecution plea, when he was produced on expiry of the two-day custody granted on July 12. In its application, the prosecution sought police custody for three more days saying it was necessary for carrying out the investigation into the conspiracy in the case. Police later took the actor, arrested on July 10, to the Aluva Police Club for interrogation. Initially the court had remanded the actor to 14 days judicial custody. “The prosecution has nothing to hide. We have all sufficient records and evidences with us. Custody (of the actor) is permitted. We will submit a report about the investigation in the court,” Special Prosecutor A Sureshan in the case told reporters. Counsel for Dileep said the court would consider the actor’s bail application on Saturday. In the past two days, police had taken the actor to various places by police as part of evidence gathering. Earlier, the 48-year-old actor, charged with criminal conspiracy in the sensational case, was brought to the court amid tight security. Police have claimed that the conspiracy to abduct and assault the actress and film the dastardly act was hatched by Dileep and ‘Pulsar’ Suni, the prime accused in the case. Dileep’s counsel has maintained that the actor had been framed in the case. Police in its remand report had claimed that Dileep had developed a grudge against the actress for letting his former wife know about his alleged affairs and hatched a conspiracy to take revenge way back in 2013. The popular actress, who has worked in Tamil and Telugu films, was abducted and allegedly molested inside her car for two hours by the accused, who had forced their way into the vehicle on February 17 and later escaped in a busy area Kochi. Six persons, including ‘Pulsar’ Suni, have been arrested in connection with the incident. After his arrest, on the charge of conspiracy, Dileep has been expelled from various film forums, including the Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes (AMMA), as the industry rallied behind the actress. Breaking her silence, the actress had yesterday expressed hope that truth would come out in the case. For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App
5.3 magnitude earthquake strikes off southern California coast  [SEP]  A significant earthquake shook the Los Angeles area Thursday afternoon, the US Geological Survey reports. Initial readings by the USGS report that the 5.3 magnitude quake struck about 60 miles off the Santa Monica coast near Santa Cruz island. There are currently no reports of any damage or injuries. NOAA has also not issued any tsunami warnings. More on this as it develops.
S. Korea's coast guard rescues all 163 after ferry hits rock  [SEP]  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's coast guard said it rescued all 163 people from a ferry that hit a rock in waters off the country's southwestern coast on Sunday. At least six people sustained minor injuries. A coast guard official said the ferry's 158 passengers and five crew members were being taken to shore on four coast guard vessels and a number of civilian fishing boats. The rescue operation went smoothly because the ferry wasn't flooded and didn't lose its balance despite the crash off islands in Sinan County, he said. The coast guard initially said the ferry was carrying 187 passengers, but later revised the number to 158. The official said it appeared the ferry hit the rock while trying to avoid a fishing boat while traveling in foggy waters. Rescue workers treated six people for minor injuries caused from the shock of the crash, which left the ferry's front pushed atop the rock, he said. Another coast guard official, from the nearby port of Mokpo, said his department planned to question the ferry's captain and crew members to investigate the cause of the crash. Tests from alcohol detectors showed that none of them had been drinking before the accident, he said. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity, citing office rules. The area is not far from where a ferry sank and killed more than 300 people in 2014, triggering a national outpouring of grief and soul-searching over lax safety standards.

U.S. slams Syria with 271 sanctions  [SEP]  The United States has issued 271 sanctions in response to Syrian President Bashar Assad’s alleged use of chemical weapons. It’s one of the largest sanction actions in U.S. history. The Trump administration said Monday that it issued sanctions against 271 employees of Syria’s Scientific Studies and Research Center, the Syrian government agency responsible for developing and producing non-conventional weapons. The action was announced in a statement by the Treasury Department, and Treasury Security Steve Mnuchin simultaneously briefed reporters at the White House. The new sanctions are the latest U.S. response to Assad’s alleged use of chemical weapons, most recently in rebel-held northern Idlib, in an attack that killed more than 80 civilians. The U.S. retaliated earlier this month by launching missiles against a Syrian airfield.
Convictions for the Murder of Boris Nemtsov  [SEP]  A Russian jury convicted five men Thursday in the murder of Russian opposition leader and prominent Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov, concluding a trial Nemtsov’s family has criticized as being insufficient. Nemtsov, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s most vocal critics, was killed while walking near the Kremlin in February 2015, just days before he was expected to help lead a major rally in Moscow opposing Russia’s war with Ukraine. The 55-year-old’s death shocked members of the country’s political opposition, which turned out in the tens of thousands to mourn his death. Zaur Dadayev, a native of Russia’s North Caucasus region and a former Chechen soldier, was found guilty of shooting Nemtsov. Four other people, also Chechens, were convicted as accomplices: Anzor Gubashev, Shadid Gubashev, Khamzat Bakhayev, and Tamerlan Eskerkhanov. During the trial, the prosecution argued the men coordinated Nemtsov’s murder in exchange for 15 million rubles ($250,000), though investigators say they still don’t know who ordered the assassination. Dadayev originally confessed to the shooting, but later recanted, claiming he was tortured into giving the confession. All of the men have since maintained their innocence. Each faces between eight years to life in prison. A sixth suspect, Beslan Shavanov, blew himself up during a standoff with authorities in Grozny, the Chechen capital. As the Moscow Times reports, prosecutors are still looking into Ruslan Mukhudinov, a Chechen officer, for allegedly ordering the assassination. He has been at large since November 2015. In response to Nemtsov’s murder, Putin vowed to make sure the perpetrators would “get the punishment they deserve,” reportedly granting the country’s intelligence agency unusually wide license to go after those responsible. But Nemtsov’s family said this promise was not met. “It’s the biggest crime of the century and yet they haven’t identified the real organizers of those who ordered it,” Vadim Prokhorov, the family’s lawyer, told reporters after the verdict, adding that the government failed to investigate Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya’s Kremlin-backed leader, who the family has long accused of being involved. Nemtsov’s daughter, Zhanna Nemtsova, also criticized the outcome in a Facebook post, adding that “the case remains unsolved.” Dmitri Peskov, Putin’s press secretary, said authorities would continue to investigate who ordered Nemtsov’s murder, noting that “sometimes such processes take years.”
FCC Votes To Begin Rollback Of Net Neutrality Regulations  [SEP]  The Federal Communications Commission has officially begun to undo Obama-era regulations on Internet service providers, often called net neutrality rules. The rules, passed in 2015, had placed cable and telecom companies under the strictest-ever oversight of the agency. In a 2-1 vote along party lines Thursday, the FCC's Republicans voted to propose a new review of the rules, with the goal of loosening the regulations on the industry. As dozens of protesters outside urged the agency to stop the proceeding and keep the strict oversight, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai argued that the current rules represented a "bureaucratic straitjacket" on the industry. "The Internet was not broken in 2015," Pai said, repeating his often-chosen turn of phrase. "The utility-style regulations known as Title II were and are like the proverbial sledgehammer being wielded against the flea. Except that here, there was no flea." The term net neutrality has come to encapsulate the idea that Internet providers such as Comcast or Verizon should treat all web traffic equally and fairly. This means they can't block access to any websites or apps, and can't meddle with loading speeds. The 2015 rules also included a ban on so-called paid prioritization: the idea that Internet providers shouldn't give special treatment to apps and websites that pay extra. The FCC's new proposal — titled "Restoring Internet Freedom" — considers not only whether to undo the legal approach that enforced those rules, but also whether the rules were warranted in the first place. As Pai puts it, the proposal would "return to the Clinton-era light-touch framework." He has also proposed to stop treating wireless carriers the same as cable providers. Pai has argued that the 2015 rules have slowed the telecom industry's investment in building out broadband access and introducing innovative products, and specifically weighed on smaller Internet providers. For the past few weeks, both supporters and critics of Pai's repeal plan have produced research making the economic case both for and against strict net neutrality rules. The dissenting Democratic commissioner, Mignon Clyburn, "vociferously" opposed Pai's proposal, calling it "no-touch" rather than light-touch. "If you unequivocally trust that your broadband provider will always put the public interest over self-interest or the interest of their stockholders, then the 'Destroying Internet Freedom' [proposal] is for you," she said. For the next 90 days, the FCC will collect comments from stakeholders and the general public before drafting a specific order and voting on whether to set it into law. During the 2015 effort to the write the net neutrality rules, more than 4 million comments poured into the agency, most of them in support of strict regulations. HBO late-night host John Oliver has driven much attention to the issue. Pai and his Republican colleague, Commissioner Mike O'Rielly, said the new review of net neutrality will include a cost-benefit analysis, which they say wasn't done in 2015. Addressing reports of bots in the commenting system, Pai urged commenters to participate in an "honest and forthright way." "Thankfully, our rulemaking proceeding is not decided like a Dancing With The Stars contest, since counts of comments submitted have only so much value," O'Rielly said, adding: "Instead of operating in economics-free zone where the benefits of the rules are assumed to outweigh any cost, commenters will need to provide evidence to support their arguments that the rules are or are not needed." Congress is also weighing whether to settle the net neutrality debate through legislation, as The Washington Post reports: Groups representing the telecom and cable industries have voiced support of Pai's push to repeal the 2015 regulations, though they assert support for an open Internet. The Internet Association, whose members include major web companies such as Amazon and Netflix, said it opposes "any changes to FCC regulations governing net neutrality." As with all previous attempts to set net neutrality rules, any final regulations that the FCC adopts under Pai are widely expected to be challenged in court.
Savinova stripped of London Games 800m gold for doping  [SEP]  ZURICH: Russia's Mariya Savinova-Farnosova has been stripped of her 800m London 2012 Olympic Games gold medal after the Court of Arbitration for Sport on Friday imposed a four-year ban saying there was "clear evidence" she used performance-enhancing drugs. The four-year penalty is retroactive to Aug. 24, 2015, the Swiss-based athletics tribunal said in a statement with Savinova also stripped of her 2011 world championships gold, 2013 world silver and 2010 European gold. South Africa's double silver medallist Caster Semenya is now in line to be promoted to gold in both the 2012 Olympics and 2011 world championships. All of Savinova-Farnosova's results between July 26, 2010 and Aug. 19, 2013, are disqualified, with any prizes, medals and prize and appearance money forfeited. The 31-year-old former 800 metre world and Olympic champion was among athletes that a commission set up by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) recommended be banned for life in 2015. CAS took the action as the decision-making authority while Russia's athletics federation remains banned over the country's state-backed doping scandal. Almost the entire track and field team of Russia were banned from competing at the Rio 2016 Olympics.
May tells Cabinet to hold their nerve as Brexit talks hit critical phase  [SEP]  Theresa May has told her Cabinet ministers to hold their nerve as Brexit negotiations hit a difficult stage in the wake of the rejection of her plans by EU leaders at Salzburg. As ministers gathered at 10 Downing Street, the British Prime Minister said she remained confident of securing a withdrawal agreement with the EU, but the Government would continue to plan for the possibility of no deal. The meeting came as the Department for Exiting the EU (Dexeu) released guidance for UK businesses and households preparing for a no-deal Brexit, which warned of possible disruption to flights and coach services to the continent. Meanwhile, hardline Brexiteers piled pressure on Mrs May to ditch her Chequers blueprint for future relations with the EU. Senior Tory Leavers including David Davis and Jacob Rees-Mogg attended the launch of a report by the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank calling on the Government to seek a “basic” free trade agreement for goods of the kind struck between the EU and Canada, while pursuing “regulatory freedom and trade independence”. Mr Rees-Mogg, who leads the influential Tory backbench European Research Group (ERG), said the Plan A-plus report offered a “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Canada” deal which the UK should seize. “This is about how you can have a fantastic Brexit that sets us up for the next generation and ensures our prosperity,” he said. “This has been offered to us by the (European) Commission, they have offered us the best trade deal they have ever done with any country ever in the world, so if you want to call it Canada plus, or super Canada or supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Canada, that is what is being aimed and its being offered.” Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson – who did not attend the launch – also endorsed the report as “a very good piece of work”. Mr Davis, who quit as Brexit Secretary in protest at the plan agreed by Cabinet at Mrs May’s country retreat in July, said it was time to “reset” negotiations with Brussels. “We’re currently, bluntly, in a cul-de-sac, I’m afraid Salzburg was all too predictable,” he said. “Now what we need to do is to use the original commitments made back on March 7 by both (European Council president Donald) Tusk and (EU chief negotiator Michel) Barnier to go for an advanced free trade agreement.” Jacob Rees-Mogg MP arrives at the launch of the Institute of Economic Affairs Brexit research paper (Victoria Jones/PA) Mrs May’s spokesman ruled out moving towards a Canada-style deal, warning it would not prevent a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. “The FTA would only apply to the Great Britain-EU relationship, with Northern Ireland effectively remaining in parts of the single market and customs union,” he said. “The PM has repeatedly set out that we must protect the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom as a whole.” At the Cabinet meeting in 10 Downing Street, Mrs May said it had always been clear that negotiations would at some point come to a critical stage. And she told ministers: “Now is the time to hold our nerve.” Mrs May said the British Government’s White Paper remained the only plan on the table which achieves the goals of frictionless trade and an open border in Ireland. She said she remained confident of securing a deal with the EU, but added that the Government would continue to “sensibly” plan for no deal. Among guidance for no-deal planning included in the latest slew of Dexeu documents were warnings that: – Passengers could face flight disruption if new permissions are not granted – Bus and coach services to European Union countries could be suspended – Chemical firms would need new registrations to continue exporting to EEA nations – Pet owners could have to make preparations with their vets four months in advance of a trip to Europe – Dozens of British traditional foods from Stilton cheese to Cornish clotted cream may be forced to apply for new protected status from the EU Mrs May told the Cabinet that she was looking to the EU to match her promise last week that expat citizens’ rights will be protected in the case of a no-deal Brexit. After talking with ministerial colleagues, she met with European Parliament Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt for what the Belgian politician described as an “open and honest exchange” on the progress of negotiations. Downing Street said the pair discussed the future economic partnership and the Northern Ireland backstop, with Mrs May stressing the need to ensure frictionless trade between the EU and the UK and maintain the constitutional integrity of the UK. Both agreed that the best solution to the Northern Ireland border would be found through an agreement on the future relationship, said Number 10.
Venezuelan police break up anti-government rally with tear gas  [SEP]  Police on motorcycles fired tear gas to break up an opposition march on the Venezuelan Supreme Court to press demands that President Nicolas Maduro leave office, as months of sometimes deadly anti-government demonstrations showed no signs of abating. The yesterday’s rally was also meant as a show of support for a slate of 33 magistrates — a so-called shadow supreme court — whose names were put forward Friday by the opposition to replace Venezuela’s current high court, which is closely allied with Maduro and frequently rules in his favor. Emboldened by a nationwide strike on Thursday that paralysed parts of the capital Caracas and other Venezuelan cities, opposition leaders held a mock swearing-in ceremony Friday for the shadow court’s new “judges.” Many of the actual court’s justices were hastily appointed shortly before Maduro’s ruling party lost its majority in congress. The shadow court has strong support from the demonstrators, organisers said Saturday. “Everyone has given their backing to the new Supreme Court,” tweeted Freddy Guevara, a leader of the opposition-led congress. “We support the new judges because they will restore independence to the Supreme Court,” said 43-year-old demonstrator Luis Torrealba, marching with his wife and teenage son. In yesterday’s march, hundreds of people took to a key Caracas motorway to head downtown toward the court building. But uniformed National Guard troops riding motorcycles fired tear gas to disperse them. Wuilly Arteaga, a violinist who has become a celebrity for playing at many opposition marches, was injured and taken to a clinic. The 23-year-old was seen with blood pouring from cuts on the left side of his face. He said later he had been struck with buckshot. “They are not going to frighten me,” Arteaga said in a video he posted on Twitter. He is seen in a hospital bed with bandages on his face and swollen lips. “We are going to keep fighting.” The swearing-in of a shadow judiciary was condemned by the government as “incitement to subversion” and an act of “treason,” and officials threatened to throw the dissidents into prison. Venezuela is in the throes of a political and economic crisis that has led to shortages of basic goods and soaring inflation. With the situation already inflamed, the stakes have risen further, after the United States threatened economic sanctions if Maduro proceeds with a controversial July 30 election of a body to rewrite the constitution. The president has vowed to maintain the July 30 election of 545 members to the “Constitutional Assembly.” Yesterday’s protests, like many others since April, were organised by the Democratic Unity Roundtable, a coalition of political opposition groups. The number of deaths in protests across the country since April has reached 103 — about one fatality per day. For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App

The Latest: May's top aides resign after UK election fiasco  [SEP]  LONDON (AP) - The Latest on the outcome of Britain's general election (all times local): British Prime Minister Theresa May's two chiefs of staff have resigned in the wake of the Conservative Party's disastrous election result. The party said Saturday that Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill have quit. The pair formed part of May's small inner circle and were blamed by many Conservatives for the party's lackluster campaign and unpopular election platform. In an article for the Conservative Home website, Timothy conceded that the campaign had failed to communicate "Theresa's positive plan for the future," and to notice surging support for the opposition Labour Party. Some senior Tories have made the removal of Hill and Timothy a condition for continuing to support May, who has vowed to remain prime minister despite the Conservatives' losing their overall majority in Parliament. Beleaguered British Prime Minister Theresa May is appointing new members of her government after several of them lost their seats in Parliament in this week's general election that proved disastrous for her Conservative Party. May's office has already said that the senior Cabinet members - Treasury chief Philip Hammond, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Amber Rudd - will keep their current jobs, but she is expected to reshuffle the lower ranks of ministers. May's party fell short of an overall majority following Thursday's vote, and plans to work with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party. May's position seems safe for the near future because Britain must start negotiations later this month on leaving the European Union, but most British newspapers agreed Saturday that she is only just clinging on. Newspapers fronted with photos of British Prime Minister Theresa May and others are displayed at a shop in Westminster in London, Saturday June 10, 2017.

Christian woman acquitted in Pakistan to leave country  [SEP]  A Christian woman acquitted in Pakistan after eight years on death row for blasphemy plans to leave the country, her family said Thursday as radical Islamists mounted rallies for a second day against the verdict, blocking roads and burning tires in protest. The developments followed a landmark move by Pakistan's Supreme Court on Wednesday that overturned the 2010 conviction against Asia Bibi for insulting Islam's Prophet Muhammad. The charge of blasphemy carries the death penalty in this majority Muslim nation. Bibi's acquittal immediately raised fears of religious violence — and presented a challenge to the government of new Prime Minister Imran Khan who came to power this summer partly by pursuing the Islamist agenda. Khan warned Islamist protesters on Wednesday night not to "test the patience of the state." Bibi remained at an undisclosed location Thursday where the 54-year-old mother of five was being held for security reasons, awaiting her formal release, her brother, James Masih told The Associated Press. Masih said his sister simply would not be safe in Pakistan. "She has no other option and she will leave the country soon," he said. Masih would not disclose the country of her destination but both France and Spain have offered asylum. Bibi's husband, Ashiq Masih, had returned from Britain with their children in mid-October and was waiting for her to join them, the brother added. Meanwhile, more than 1,000 Islamists blocked a key road linking the capital, Islamabad with the garrison city of Rawalpindi on Thursday, demanding Bibi be publicly hanged. Authorities deployed paramilitary troops, signaling they could move in to clear the roads. Protesters, rallied by firebrand cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi, also set up roadblocks and burned tires in the southern port city of Karachi while hundreds of Islamists clashed Thursday with police in various parts of eastern Punjab province. Many parents kept their children from school, fearing more violence. The Islamists also called for the killing of the three judges, including Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, who acquitted Bibi. The three are on the hit list of Rizvi's Tehreek-e-Labbaik party, which has demanded a public execution for Bibi. Rizvi has managed to turn out tens of thousands of supporters in the past, often forcing authorities to bow to his demands on religious matters. Tehreek-e-Labbaik claimed Thursday that two of its supporters were killed by police fire during overnight clashes in Karachi. No government official could immediately confirm any casualties. In his televised speech, Prime Minister Khan warned the Islamists: "Let me make it very clear to you that the state will fulfil its responsibility." Bibi's lawyer, Saiful Malook, has gone into hiding as the extremists had threatened his life as well. On Wednesday, cleric Afzal Qadri, with Rizvi by his side, urged a crowd of supporters outside the Punjab provincial parliament in the city of Lahore to revolt against army chief Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa and overthrow Khan's government. Bibi's acquittal, however, has been seen as a hopeful sign by Christians in Pakistan, where the mere rumor of blasphemy can spark lynchings. Religious minorities, who have been repeatedly targeted by extremists, fear the law because it is often used to settle scores and to pressure minorities. In 2011, Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab, was shot and killed by one of his guards for defending Bibi and criticizing the misuse of the blasphemy law. The assassin, Mumtaz Qadri, was hanged for the crime, but later was hailed by religious hard-liners as a martyr, with millions visiting a shrine set up for him near Islamabad. Shahbaz Bhatti, Pakistan's minister for minorities was also killed in 2011 after he demanded justice for Bibi. Bibi was arrested in 2009 after she was accused of blasphemy following a quarrel with two fellow female farm workers who refused to drink from a water container used by a Christian. A few days later, a mob accused her of insulting Islam's prophet, leading to her 2010 conviction. Bibi's family has always maintained her innocence and says she never insulted the prophet. Associated Press writer Asim Tanveer in Multan, Pakistan, contributed to this report.

Roberto Azevedo says a "trade war is in no one's interests." A WTO spokesman relayed Azevedo comments to The Associated Press in an email just hours after President Donald Trump tweeted: "When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win." Azevedo warned: "The potential for escalation is real, as we have seen from the initial responses of others." He said the WTO "will be watching the situation very closely."

Video: What's next for Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket  [SEP]  The first liftoff of the sundtrack right there. Brand-new era in space exploration. There's another look. Uh-huh and seeing that Tesla with starman, the mannequin, driving into orbit -- A car. It's a real car and some people don't believe that image but it is a real image. "The New York post" has this, car trek. I love it. David Kerley was there, lucky man, there to witness the incredible launch of that and he he's joining us from titusville, Florida. Good morning, David. Reporter: Good morning, Michael. A new space race is on this morning and Elon Musk just took a half billion dollar leap ahead of the competition and launched a private company, the biggest rocket in the world successfully with the most unusual cargo we've probably ever seen. He sent his car into space. It is headed to Mars at this hour after sending back some spectacular pictures. Three, two, one. Reporter: Now the biggest rocket in the world spacey's falcon heavy, three rockets strapped together launched a new era of American space travel. Successful separation. Reporter: But this was different. The boosters separated and then flew back to Earth landing together reusable. And the falcon has landed. Wow. Reporter: The center rocket coming back to Earth ran out of fuel and slammed into the ocean. It was lost. A setback for the $90 million test flight which needed some cargo, and rather than concrete, spacex's CEO Elon Musk who also runs the electric car company Tesla decided the payload, the weight at the head of the rocket under the skin would be his electric car, a red roadster. So there it was, a car with a dummy in a space suit exposed to space floating and sending spectacular pictures back of it and the Earth with David bowie music playing in the background. ??? Life on Mars ??? Reporter: Musk said he ought this launch only had a 50% chance of this spectacular success. What did falcon heavy teach you. Crazy things can come true because I didn't really think this would work. When I see the rocket lift off I see like a thousand things that could not work and it's amazing when they do. Reporter: So for a few hours before the rocket and this Tesla were boosted toward Mars and the sun, those amazing pictures, even for musk he found it funny, silly, iconic and wondering if thousands or millions of years from now aliens might discover this strange test cargo. Thinking what the heck -- what were these guys doing? Did they worship this car? Reporter: With the success, musk now has the advantage of sending rockets, satellite, maybe even humans into space. It's billions of dollars of business. Michael, he says he may send another one of these falcon heavys up into the space area in a matter of months actually. But, David, where exactly is that Tesla roadster and starman right now? Reporter: All right, so it circled the Earth. We have those spectacular pictures and then last night the final burn, they sent it o&e headed towards Mars. It is going there this morning. It could be out there for millions, a billion years if it actually survives space. Looks like it's surviving all right so far. David Kerley, thank you so much. The launch was impressed more than us, it impressed Bill Nye the science guy and tweeted this celebrating the launch with buzz aldrin. Said he walked on the moon, you know. And one person actually compared the Tesla image to the iconic moment in the movie "E.T." That's pretty good. The more you see it the more amazed you are by it. Quite a feat, okay.

Disease gene ‘edited’ in human embryos in scientific first  [SEP]  Disease gene ‘edited’ in human embryos in scientific first Personal genomic company 23andMe sequences your DNA but no longer provides insights into your risk factors for certain diseases. — AFP picPARIS, Aug 3 — Scientists in the United States have repaired a disease-causing mutation in the DNA of early-stage human embryos, they said yesterday, taking a step closer to engineering babies free of inherited disorders. The team’s successful use of the CRISPR “gene editing” tool in viable embryos was hailed as a technical feat by outside experts, who called at the same time for deeper debate on the ethics of altering human DNA. The lab-created, edited embryos were not allowed to develop beyond a few days, when they comprised a handful of cells. Just over 72 per cent of the embryos — 42 out of 58 — ended up being free of a heart disease-causing mutation carried in the DNA of the sperm used to create them, a team reported in the journal Nature. This was an improvement on the 50-per cent odds for embryos that result naturally from a couple in which one partner carries the coding error. With further improvement, said study co-author Paula Amato of the Oregon Health & Science University, the method “can potentially be used to prevent transmission of genetic disease to future generations”. The alteration itself is heritable, meaning that the children and grandchildren of a person born with edited DNA will be safe from the same genetic disease. Further research is needed to determine the technique’s safety, and to boost its accuracy to as close to 100 per cent as possible before it can be used to create embryos meant to develop into healthy babies. “I am quite sure that there are tools that we could use to improve... this repair so that we could achieve say 90 to maybe 100-per cent efficiency, then I would say we would be ready to move to clinical trials,” said Amato’s colleague Shoukhrat Mitalipov. Gene editing is controversial because it evokes a future in which humans can order “designer” babies with specific features — blonde hair, athleticism, perhaps even intelligence. But there is also the prospect of avoiding heritable, genetic diseases that can handicap or kill. Amato, Shoukhrat and a team studied a gene mutation which causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a hereditary disease of the heart muscle which can translate into sudden heart failure and death, notably in athletes. It is a type of disorder, like Huntington’s Disease, that requires an abnormal gene from just one parent. The researchers used sperm from a donor carrying the mutation, and eggs from healthy women. They injected the CRISPR-Cas9 editing tool into the eggs at the same time as the sperm — a major departure from what other teams have done. The researchers found that 72.4 per cent of the embryos, not 50 per cent as would have been expected, were free of the errant gene. Nor were there unintended mutations in other parts of the genome. In previous CRISPR studies in China, the gene-editing tool was added only after fertilisation. Those teams had problems with “mosaicism”, which occurs when some cells in an embryo are corrected, and some not. In the new study, just one embryo turned out a mosaic. “We definitely want to replicate this study with other mutations and other donors,” said Amato. CRISPR is a revolutionary gene-editing technique which allows scientists to insert, remove and correct DNA within a cell with pinpoint precision. For Peter Braude, a reproductive health expert from King’s College London, the study showed that “germline genome editing has moved from future fantasy to the world of possibility.” The debate about using it in practice, he added, “needs to run to catch up”. “Perhaps the biggest question, and probably the one that will be debated the most, is whether we should be physically altering the genes of an IVF (lab-created) embryo at all,” added Darren Griffin of the University of Kent, in Britain. “Equally, the debate on how morally acceptable it is not to act when we have the technology to prevent these life-threatening diseases must also come into play.” Currently, the only way to avoid heritable disease in assisted reproduction, is to fertilise eggs in the lab, analyse the DNA of the resulting embryos, and eliminate those containing errors. The new CRISPR technique could be used to increase the number of viable embryos for implantation, said the team, thus reducing the number of eggs that have to be invasively harvested. In 2015, a UN bioethics committee called for a stop to human embryo gene editing for fears it could be used to modify the human race. Last year, Britain granted scientists permission to edit embryo DNA in research on the causes of infertility and miscarriages. And in February this year, a US science advisory committee said such modification should be allowed in future to eliminate disease. — AFP
Long awaited IG report says McCabe fired for leaking, lying under oath  [SEP]  Ousted FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe improperly leaked information to a reporter and then lied to both his boss, then-Director James Comey, and to FBI agents investigating his behavior, the Justice Department inspector general said Friday. He was under oath when he lied to the FBI agents, the inspector general said in a lengthy new report that could prove devastating to Mr. McCabe’s credibility, and to other ongoing investigations. “The OIG found that then-Deputy Director Andrew McCabe lacked candor, including under oath, on multiple occasions in connection with describing his role in connection with a disclosure to the WSJ, and that this conduct violated FBI Offense Codes 2.5 and 2.6,” the audit concluded. The full IG report on Andrew McCabe is found here. “The OIG also concluded that McCabe’s disclosure of the existence of an ongoing investigation in the manner described in this report violated the FBI’s and the Department’s media policy and constituted misconduct.” This is an excerpt.

EU fines Google a record 2.42 billion euros  [SEP]  BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union's competition watchdog slapped a record 2.42 billion euro — $2.72 billion — fine on internet giant Google on Tuesday for breaching antitrust rules with its online shopping service. European regulators said "Google has abused its market dominance as a search engine by giving an illegal advantage to another Google product, its comparison shopping service.'' It gave the Mountain View, California, company 90 days to stop or face fines of up to five percent of the average daily worldwide turnover of parent company Alphabet. The European Commission, which polices EU competition rules, alleges Google elevates its shopping service even when other options might have better deals. The Commission said Google "gave prominent placement in its search results only to its own comparison shopping service, whilst demoting rival services. It stifled competition on the merits in comparison shopping markets.'' Google maintains it's just trying to package its search results in a way that makes it easier for consumers to find what they want. "When you shop online, you want to find the products you're looking for quickly and easily. And advertisers want to promote those same products. That's why Google shows shopping ads, connecting our users with thousands of advertisers, large and small, in ways that are useful for both,'' Kent Walker, senior vice president at Google, said in a statement. "We will review the Commission's decision in detail as we consider an appeal, and we look forward to continuing to make our case,'' he said. The fine is the highest ever imposed in Europe for anti-competitive behavior, exceeding a 1.06 billion euros penalty on Silicon Valley chip maker Intel in 2009. But the penalty is likely to leave a bigger dent in Google's pride and reputation than its finances. Alphabet has more than $92 billion (82 billion euros) in cash, including nearly $56 billion (50 billion euros) in accounts outside of Europe.
Thai official: 5 reported missing from sunken boat are alive  [SEP]  Five people reported to have been missing from a tour boat that sank in a storm off the southern resort island of Phuket are alive, Thai authorities said Monday, though it’s unclear if the five survived the sinking or never got on the boat. Phuket Gov. Norrapat Plodthong said authorities are trying to verify their details and some of them may have left Thailand. Norrapat said the development came after new information emerged from Thai immigration and the Chinese Embassy. The new information also showed there were 89 tourists, 87 of them Chinese, on the boat, instead of the previous figure of 93, he said. The number of people who are missing has been lowered from 14 to 10, including the five who are alive but whose whereabouts are unclear, he said. The death toll remains at 42, including a body still trapped under the wreckage. The double-decker Phoenix capsized and sank late Thursday afternoon after it was hit by 5-meter (16-foot) waves in one of Thailand’s worse tourism-related disasters since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that killed thousands. Officials said all of the dead were Chinese comprising 13 children, 18 women and 10 men. The age and sex of the body still under the wreckage wasn’t known. Navy officials on Monday were attempting to flip the boat to retrieve the body and check for other possible victims. Special equipment has been brought in to lift up the boat, which is sitting some 45 meters (148 feet) beneath the surface, officials said. Tourism is a vital part of the Thai economy, with the World Bank estimating the Southeast Asian nation generates about 12 percent of its gross domestic product from tourism receipts. Chinese tourists are a key driver of the industry, accounting for 9.8 million of the record 35.38 million tourists to visit the country last year. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the country’s military ruler, expressed his “profound sadness” in a letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping. In the letter released by the foreign ministry Monday, Prayuth said a full investigation is underway to find the cause of the tragedy and assured Xi his government is determined to ensure such incidents would not recur. Prayuth arrived in Phuket on Monday to observe the operations and will visit Chinese relatives and survivors at a hospital. Police said the captain of the Phoenix has been charged with “careless conduct leading to death” and could face more than three years in jail. The captain of another boat that capsized on the same day and the manager of a travel agency that chartered the boat have also been charged for being careless leading to injuries. All the passengers from the second ship were rescued. Tourism Minister Weerasak Kowsurat, who is in Phuket, has said the government will “spare no one” and will bring all those responsible to justice. Families of each victim could receive up to 1.4 million Thai baht ($42,000) in compensation, officials said.
Astronaut Peggy Whitson breaks American spaceflight record  [SEP]  U.S. astronaut Peggy Whitson is smashing records left and right.Whitson, 57, broke the record for the most cumulative time in space by an American astronaut early Monday, streaking past the 534-day record held by Jeff Williams. The 879-day global record, held by Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka, still stands.Earlier this month, ABC13's Kevin Quinn interviewed Whitson as she was just days away from setting the world record.By the time she returns to Earth in September, Whitson will have spent 666 days in floating above the planet. She hopes she won't hold the title for long."I'm not here because of the record," Whitson told ABC News' David Kerley via video teleconference from aboard the ISS earlier this month. "I'm definitely here for conducting the science."The research she's doing is "a really important stepping stone" to sending astronauts on even longer missions to Mars -- "the sooner the better," Whitson hopes.Whitson, an Iowa native, is no stranger to shattering records. In 2008, she became the first woman to command the ISS, and just last month -- during her eighth spacewalk -- Whitson surpassed NASA's Sunita Williams for the woman with the most cumulative "extra-vehicular activity" time.Her journey hasn't always been smooth sailing.During re-entry following her second mission in 2008, her Soyuez capsule experienced a technical glitch, sending it hurtling into a violent dive and exposing the crew to forces eight times more powerful than the earth's gravity for more than a minute.Nevertheless, her time in space is "one of those rides you hope never ends," Whitson tweeted Sunday. "I am so grateful for all those who helped me on each of my missions."President Trump and first daughter Ivanka Trump are expected to call the ISS from the Oval Office to congratulate Whitson on her achievement Monday morning.

The following figures were taken between 1am and 4am GMT November 6th 2018 A “generic ballot” poll asks the person which party they would prefer to control Congress or would vote for in their district. The website FiveThirtyEight has a page summarizing those polls and the spreadsheet is here. The last six polls so listed are here: Due to time constraints this will not be considered The United States has analysts and academics who produce their own predictions of the outcomes. Their predictions are complicated by the concept of a “toss-up” or “too close to call” (TCTC): elements which they decline to predict, and by the use of qualifiers such as “Tilt”, “Lean”, “Likely”, etc. A summary of the predictions can be found on the Wikipedia election pages for the Senate and the House. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2018) Two senators (Angus King and Bernie Sanders) are Independent but “caucus” (vote) with the Democrats. They are considered to be safe in their seats and are included with the Democrats in the table below. 35 seats are contested (24+2 Democrats, 9 Republicans). All 435 seats are up for election. No independents. The Daily Kos site is not clear enough for me to easily extract the data. 538 gives three options (lite, classic, deluxe) and two modes (one by probability, one by district). I have chosen the classic mode. I looked at five bookies: Ladbrokes, PaddyPower, SportingIndex (Spin), Betway, Coral. Spin were again suspended at the time of inspection. The seats are deduced from the over/under. The Coral and Ladbrokes senate majority odds were deduced from Rep>50 (Rep majority), Rep=50 (no majority) and Rep<50 (Dem majority). Ladbrokes acquired Coral in 2016 and were themselves acquired by GVC in 2018, which presumably explains why Ladbrokes and Coral odds are identical.

San Antonio mall robbery leaves good Samaritan dead  [SEP]  SAN ANTONIO, Texas (CNN) – A man who was killed trying to stop a robbery at a San Antonio, Texas, mall is being hailed as a good Samaritan, and police have arrested two suspects who will face murder charges. “What we have here is a robbery gone really, really bad,” San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said. “It’s absolutely senseless.” Police say two men tried to rob a Kay Jewelers store Sunday in the Rolling Oaks Mall. McManus said shopper Jonathan Murphy tried to intervene and was fatally shot. A second shopper, who had a gun and a concealed carry license, shot and wounded one of the suspects, who was reported to be in critical condition. The wounded suspect was arrested and taken to a hospital. Police found the second suspect, Jason Matthew Prieto, 34, after a car wreck that occurred about 20 minutes later. Police said six other people were injured and taken to a hospital. “Prayers for all affected by this robbery & shooting in San Antonio at Rolling Oaks Mall. Justice for the robbers & killers,” Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted. Both suspects will be charged with capital murder and two counts of aggravated robbery, police said.
Lack of public transport in Karachi  [SEP]  Lack of regulation has made public transport sector of Karachi chaotic and messy, resulting in immense problems for the millions of commuters of this mega city and the inept bureaucracy still has no clue about how to tackle this serious urban social issue. This causes crowds of commuters waiting at bus stops and dangerously overcrowded minibuses with commuters even sitting on their rooftops. These roof racks stay despite the instructions of the Supreme Court of Pakistan to dismantle them. The government should have cancelled the route permits of transporters who are not interested to play their vehicles on these routes and invite other transporter to obtain these routes, but this practice is yet to be started. The route issuing authorities should link the route permits with specific vehicles, so these minibuses may only be run on their authorised routes. The name of the route should be painted on front, rear and the sides of the vehicle so that it runs only on that particular route and not switched to any other route as per the wish of its owner. Another grave fleecing of commuters is that the public transport runs on cheap CNG but charge fare on the basis of use of costly diesel. The system of issuing fare tickets to commuters is not being followed in Karachi due to sheer inefficiency of transport department. The public transport system in Karachi cannot improve till only wide-bodied buses are allowed to ply on its streets and all narrow-bodied minibuses and coaches are phased out from the city. This needs a strong political will and vision on the part of government. Karachi public transporter is immensely profitable sector and if the government announces giving bus routes only to wide-bodied buses many new investors would jump into arena for making quick money.
LA Will Be Home to New George Lucas Museum  [SEP]  Los Angeles has been chosen as the home of filmmaker George Lucas' new Museum of Narrative Art, city officials announced Tuesday. The museum is expected to be built in Exposition Park, joining a cluster of other museums. The museum's board chose Los Angeles over a competing proposal from San Francisco. For nearly a decade, the filmmaker has tried to build a museum to house an extensive personal collection that includes 40,000 paintings, illustrations and film-related items. But legal entanglements and other complications have thwarted his efforts. The Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, as it will be called, promises hundreds of jobs and a high-profile attraction. The "Star Wars" creator is financing the project himself. He plans to spend more than $1 billion to build the museum, endow it and provide a trove of initial artworks valued at over $400 million. Together with Chinese architect Ma Yansong, Lucas has proposed a sleek, futuristic design looks like a cross between the Guggenheim and a galactic starfighter.

Israel police recommend Netanyahu corruption charge: reports  [SEP]  Israeli police on Tuesday recommended that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be indicted in two cases of alleged corruption after a long-running probe, media reports said. A decision to press formal charges against the long-serving premier now rests with the attorney general's office, which is expected to take weeks or months to decide how to proceed. Netanyahu, who has repeatedly said he has done nothing wrong, is not expected to resign. A prime minister who is facing such police recommendations or who has been formally charged with offences is not obliged to resign. Various Israeli media reported that police had informed Netanyahu's lawyers that they were recommending his indictment in both corruption cases involving him that they have been investigating. There was no immediate reaction from Netanyahu, who has been prime minister for a total of nearly 12 years, and police declined to comment when contacted by AFP. Netanyahu was expected to speak soon. Police have been investigating Netanyahu over suspicions that he received expensive gifts, including pricey cigars, from wealthy supporters such as Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire James Packer. The gifts were reportedly worth some tens of thousands of dollars. Police have also been probing allegations that Netanyahu sought a secret deal for favourable coverage with the publisher of top-selling newspaper Yediot Aharonot.
Germany Converts a Mistake by Chile Into a Confederations Cup Title  [SEP]  ST. PETERSBURG, Russia — Germany survived a whirlwind assault by Chile and capitalized on an awful mistake to claim a 1-0 victory in a pulsating, bad-tempered Confederations Cup final on Sunday. Germany, which won the title for the first time, got the only goal of the game from Lars Stindl in the 20th minute when Chile midfielder Marcelo Diaz gave the ball away on the edge of his own area. Chile, playing with its trademark high octane style and driven forward by another relentless display by Arturo Vidal, dominated the match but was let down by poor finishing. The game featured missed chances, defensive howlers, scuffles and two video reviews, one producing a highly controversial outcome in the second half. Chile defender Gonzalo Jara elbowed Timo Werner by the touchline, and Serbian referee Milorad Mazic, alerted by the video assistants, let Jara off with a yellow card instead of a red.
Louisville holds off Memphis  [SEP]  LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- The No. 21 Louisville Cardinals survived a rally by the Memphis Tigers to hold on for a 24-17 victory on Saturday in frigid Papa John’s Cardinal Stadium. After Memphis had rallied from a 24-3 deficit to trail just 24-17, the Tigers forced a Louisville punt from near midfield with three minutes to go. But the Tigers were called for roughing the kicker to kill their chances to pull off the upset. Louisville, which won its fourth straight game, improved to 10-1 overall, 6-1 in the American Athletic Conference. Memphis, which had a two-game winning streak snapped, fell to 3-7, 1-5. ”I am so happy for our team,“ said Louisville coach Charlie Strong. ”The first time in school history that we’ve had double-digit wins (Louisville was 11-2 last season) two years in a row. “I know it wasn’t pretty, but to just see our seniors go out on such an emotional day (on Senior Day). ... We have a group of players that are now 21-3 in our last 24 games. This is a special group. We have a chance to get 11 wins, and not many teams can say they won 11 games two years in a row. Give Memphis credit. They made us work. They played a great game.” Louisville led 24-3 after scoring a touchdown on the opening possession of the second half. But the Cardinals stalled thereafter, and Memphis scored two touchdowns in the fourth quarter to make it interesting. ”That was a rough game, obviously,“ Memphis coach Justin Fuente said. ”Congratulations to Louisville. They have a fine football team “If you want to beat Louisville, you can’t make mistakes. You can play as hard as you want, but that’s too good of a football team to make those mistakes.” Before that fourth quarter, the story was the Louisville defense, which had limited Memphis to 167 yards with four sacks, an interception and a fumble recovery returned for a touchdown through three quarters. Then Memphis rallied, getting a 4-yard touchdown run by quarterback Paxton Lynch and a 6-yard touchdown pass from Lynch to tight end Jesse Milleson. Louisville quarterback Teddy Bridgewater was 26 of 36 for 220 yards, getting most of that in the second and third quarters. He had just 21 yards passing in the first quarter and 41 in the fourth quarter. He also was sacked four times. “We knew coming in that we would have to execute on both sides of the ball and on special teams,” Bridgewater said. “For us to get up and then they started fighting back -- you know those things happen. It’s about how you answer. We were able to finish strong and are glad to get the win.” An interception and 36-yard return by Charles Gaines in the first quarter went for naught when Bridgewater was sacked for a 10-yard loss on fourth-and-1 from the Memphis 16. The fumble by Lynch was returned 48 yards for a touchdown by middle linebacker Preston Brown in the first quarter. “I had a lot of emotions going through my mind,” Brown said. “My grandfather died this morning, so there were a lot of emotions on me, but it was great to get a touchdown for him.” Brown made a nifty juke at about the 20-yard line to evade the last Memphis player with a chance to tackle him. “Well, he played running back in high school,” Strong said. The defense continued to shine in the second quarter, and Bridgewater got going. Louisville held Memphis to a field goal after the Tigers gained a first-and-goal from the 1-yard line midway through the quarter, and Bridgewater threw a 39-yard TD pass to DeVante Parker on the Cardinals’ ensuing possession. It was Parker’s ninth touchdown catch this season. After Louisville forced a three-and-out and a punt on Memphis’ ensuing possession, Bridgewater drove the Cardinals 37 yards to John Wallace’s 37-yard field goal to make it 17-3 at the half. Louisville drove 75 yards with the second-half kickoff to a 4-yard TD run by Dominique Brown to make it 24-3, but the Cards got lethargic from there and Memphis rallied. The Tigers’ first touchdown capped a 62-yard drive, and they drove 86 yards in 12 plays on their next possession for their final score. “They ran a lot of back-door screens and back-door handoffs on the draw,” Dominique Brown said. “They did a great job.” Louisville gave Memphis the ball back at the 6-yard line after disdaining a short field-goal try because Strong said he didn’t want to risk a block and run back. There were just 37 seconds left at that point, and Memphis advanced only 17 yards to the 23 before the final gun. Lynch finished 11 of 23 for 144 yards and a TD with an interception. The Tigers ran for 135 yards after getting just 48 in the first half. Brandon Hayes rushed for 86 yards on 22 carries. Louisville ran for 122 yards, led by Dominique Brown with 54 on 17 carries. NOTES: Louisville junior S Calvin Pryor, who ranks second on the team with 57 tackles and is being mentioned for All-American notice, did not play for “a violation of a team rule,” coach Charlie Strong said after the game. Sophomore Gerod Holliman started in Pryor’s place and had two tackles. ... Twenty seniors were recognized on Senior Day for Louisville. QB Teddy Bridgewater, a junior who is widely regarded as a top-five NFL draft pick and who is expected to leave for the NFL after this season, was not recognized. He has not announced a decision whether to leave. ... Louisville had lost the previous four Senior Day games. ... Louisville is off next week and will play at Cincinnati on Dec. 5 to close the regular season. ... Memphis will play host to Temple next Saturday. ... Louisville and Memphis, which were former rivals in the Missouri Valley, Metro and Conference USA, have met 43 times, with the Cardinals holding a 24-19 advantage. ... Louisville WR Eli Rogers had to sit out the first half after incurring a targeting penalty against Houston last Saturday. Rogers, a junior who was a high school teammate of Bridgewater‘s, was tied for second on the team with 36 receptions and four touchdown catches. He had one catch for six yards in the second half.
Trump Slaps China With $50 Billion In Trade Tariffs On Imports  [SEP]  The White House has announced a 25-percent tariff on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods in what it calls a clampdown on unfair trade practices by Beijing. The US trade representative’s office said it issued a revised China tariff list covering 1,102 separate product categories. Since his presidential election campaign, US President Donald Trump has pledged to cut the trade deficit between the US and China and to curb Beijing’s allegedly unfair trade practices. Trump has also accused China of stealing US technology and intellectual property. “In light of China’s theft of intellectual property and technology and its other unfair trade practices, the US will implement a 25 percent tariff on $50 billion of goods from China that contain industrially significant technologies,” according to the White House statement. “This includes goods related to China’s Made in China 2025 strategic plan to dominate the emerging high-technology industries that will drive future economic growth for China, but hurt economic growth for the United States and many other countries.” The step is expected to escalate trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies. Earlier, Chinese officials warned of mirror measures, pledging to introduce import tariffs on US goods such as automobiles, aircraft, and soybeans.
Untreatable ‘Super Gonorrhea’ On The Rise, Says New WHO Report  [SEP]  One of the most common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is becoming harder and harder to treat. According to NBC News, on Friday the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the drug-resistant gonorrhea is becoming more common, making a once easily treated infection into a nightmare disease. Experts claim that over the years, the bacteria strains have evolved “outsmarting” the current medicine available. “The bacteria that cause gonorrhea are particularly smart. Every time we use a new class of antibiotics to treat the infection, the bacteria evolve to resist them,” said WHO’s Dr. Teodora Wi. Currently gonorrhea—also called “the clap” and “the drip”—is treated with penicillin, but more and more countries are reporting that they have to go down a list of drugs in order to successfully treat people. Sign Up For Our Newsletter! The WHO stated that 97 percent of countries report gonorrhea that resists ciprofloxacin, 81 percent have found cases that resist azithromycin and two-thirds of countries have found strains that resist the last-resort drugs: extended-spectrum cephalosporins such as oral cefixime or injectable ceftriaxone. And this is just the “tip of the iceburg,” says Wi. Before you freak out, be clear: This doesn’t mean gonorhea is untreatable. But the WHO did admit that there have been a few cases that did not respond to treatment at all. “To date, three extensively drug-resistant gonococcal strains with high-level resistance to ceftriaxone (‘superbugs’) have also been reported — in France, Japan, and Spain,” the WHO wrote in their report. The WHO stressed that gonorrhea rates around the world are going up due to lack of “condom use, increased urbanization and travel, poor infection detection rates, and inadequate or failed treatment all contribute to this increase.” They also emphasize that we need new drugs, but currently there are only 3 new candidate drugs in the clinical trial phases. “To address the pressing need for new treatments for gonorrhoea, we urgently need to seize the opportunities we have with existing drugs and candidates in the pipeline. In the short term, we aim to accelerate the development and introduction of at least one of these pipeline drugs, and will evaluate the possible development of combination treatments for public health use,” said Dr Manica Balasegaram, the director of Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership. “Any new treatment developed should be accessible to everyone who needs it, while ensuring it’s used appropriately, so that drug resistance is slowed as much as possible.” Why this matters to African-Americans According to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, in 2015 there were 395,216 reported cases of gonorrhea in the US, up 13 percent from 2014. Sadly, African-Americans bear the brunt of this epidemic: Our rates are 9.6 times higher than our white counterparts. And young folks need to be extremely careful given that the highest rates in our community occur in those between the ages of 15-34. Here’s what to look for... According to the CDC, symptoms in men include: • None A white, yellow, or green discharge from the penis But keep in mind: Plenty of people don’t show ANY signs that they have the infection. What are the dangers of untreated gonorrhea? First off: It’s not deadly. But being undiagnosed and untreated for STIs can bring about a range of complications that include chronic pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancy, fetal death and infertility. It can also raise your risk of contracting HIV five times over. This is why it’s so important to be tested and treated for STIs, especially given that most STIs, especially in men, show no symptoms. So many folks are completely unaware of their status and in fact may be unintentionally infecting others. Learn more about STIs and how to get tested for them at cdc.gov.

Samsung updates smartwatch, Lenovo ditches laptop keyboard  [SEP]  NEW YORK – Samsung’s next smartwatch will come with GPS capabilities and the ability to call or text for help by triple-tapping a side button. The new Gear S3 retains the circular design of the current S2 model, but is slightly larger. Samsung will still sell last year’s S2 to those who consider the S3 too big on their wrist. As with the S2, the outer ring of the watch face rotates to let you scroll through notifications and apps. Interface improvements include the ability to accept or reject calls with the ring rather than a swipe of the screen. The S3 will come in three flavors. One has LTE cellular capabilities, allowing people to make calls, receive notifications and check weather without a companion phone nearby. A data plan costs extra. The other two models lack LTE and differ primarily in style. Samsung said prices will be announced closer to the devices’ availability later in the year. Samsung announced the new watch lineup Wednesday at the IFA tech show in Berlin. The Gear smartwatches have had impressive designs and battery life, but have been hampered largely by a dearth of apps, as many developers write for Apple Watch and Android Wear devices instead. All three S3 models will have GPS, making them more accurate for workouts. In the S2, GPS was limited to a pricier model with cellular capabilities (on the slower 3G network). GPS, so far, isn’t common in smartwatches, allowing Samsung to stand out with the S3. Although GPS tends to drain battery quickly, Samsung expects at least three days of battery life in the S3. Meanwhile, the emergency-calling feature echoes the “SOS” feature coming to the Apple Watch this fall. Where the Apple Watch will call 911 or the relevant emergency service elsewhere directly, though, the S3 will call or text emergency contacts, such as friends or relatives. These will be pre-recorded or pre-written messages. For an extra recurring fee, which has yet to be announced, S3 users will also be able to make a live call to ADT’s security dispatchers, who would then be able to call 911 or offer other help. The S3 also comes with expanded ability to make payments at stores through Samsung Pay. And the watch’s always-on feature improves with a display of millions of colors, rather than just 16 before. Also at the IFA tech show, Lenovo unveiled a twist on the laptop: Its new Yoga Book won’t have a physical keyboard. It’s an odd choice, given that Apple, Samsung and other tablet makers are pushing professional tablet models with keyboard accessories. Those companies are hoping to appeal to businesses and individuals looking to replace their laptops. In Lenovo’s case, the 10-inch Yoga Book retains the clamshell design of the laptop, but puts a second touch screen where the keyboard normally goes. People can type on a touch-screen keyboard there, or just write or draw on that second screen with an included stylus. You can even use a regular pen or pencil, though you’d want to put a sheet of paper over the screen to avoid damage. Although Lenovo calls Yoga Book a tablet, the keyboard part isn’t detachable, making the device a laptop. The keyboard, though, can fold all the way to the back to make the device feel more like a tablet. Lenovo says the Yoga Book is 9.6 millimeters (0.38 inch) thick, slightly more than the thickest iPad at 7.5 millimeters. Jeff Meredith, a Lenovo vice president, said the Yoga Book might not be appropriate for extensive typing, but should be suitable for people – especially younger people – who now use the phone’s touch screen to respond to email at night or even take notes in classrooms. He added that when BlackBerrys were still popular, people couldn’t imagine getting rid of physical keyboards on their phones, either. The Yoga Book will start shipping in the coming weeks. An Android version will cost $500, and Windows will be $600.
Indo-US relationship stands on merits, not to contain China: Admiral Harry Harris  [SEP]  WASHINGTON: The Indo-US relationship stands on its own merits, according to a top American commander who said that China is using its military and economic power to "erode" the rules-based international order."There are those who question the motives for the increasingly cooperative relationship between the US and India. Some have said that it is to contain China. That is simply not true," Commander of the US Pacific Command Admiral Harry Harris said in his address to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in Brisbane yesterday."The US-India relationship stands on its own merits. That is why I made enhancing our relationship with India a major line of effort when I took command of Pacific Command," Harris said, a day after the Chinese media raised questions on the increasing relationship between India and the United States."The growing US-India relationship has also inspired my thinking about partnerships like our Australian alliance, the US' deepening cooperation with India is based on shared values and shared concerns. I have spoken about the clear benefits of a 'democracy quadrilateral' that enhances security cooperation between Australia, India, Japan , and the US," Harris said.China, he said, poses a challenge to the US."China is using its military and economic power to erode the rules-based international order."I believe the Chinese are building up combat power and positional advantage in an attempt to assert de facto sovereignty over disputed maritime features and spaces in the South China Sea... where they are fundamentally altering the physical and political landscape by creating and militarising man-made bases," the four star ranked admiral said."Fake islands should not be believed by real people," Harris said, apparently referring to the artificial islands being built by China in the disputed South China Sea.China claims almost all of the resource-rich South China Sea and Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims.America's goal, he said, remains to convince China that its best future comes from peaceful cooperation, meaningful participation in the current rules-based international order, and honouring its international commitments."I have also been loud and clear that we won't allow the shared domains to be closed down unilaterally. So we will cooperate where we can, but remain ready to confront where we must."Ultimately, the US seeks a constructive and result- oriented relationship with China. This will benefit America, our allies - especially Australia - and our partners, while pressing China to abide by international rules and norms," Harris added.
UN expert voices grave concern over fighting in Myanmar's Kachin state  [SEP]  UNITED NATIONS, May 1 (APP)::A United Nations rights expert Tuesday expressed grave concern over reports that Myanmar’s military has used heavy weapons and conducted aerial bombings in civilian areas as fighting against ethnic rebels in northern Kachin state has escalated sharply. While the world focuses on the plight of Myanmar’s Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state, a civil war has flared against the Kachin Independence Army, with thousands of civilians displaced from their villages near the Chinese border, according to the United Nations. What we are seeing in Kachin state over the past few weeks is wholly unacceptable, and must stop immediately,” Yanghee Lee, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, said on Tuesday. According to UN reports, more than 5,000 civilians have been displaced from villages near the Chinese border in the last three weeks. Children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with disabilities are among those who have been displaced. In a press statement, the UN rights expert reiterated that all parties to the conflict had to abide by international humanitarian law, and take precautions not to harm civilians. Civilians must never be subjected to violence during the course of conflict. All parties must take all necessary measures to ensure their safety and security, she said. Ms. Lee also raised concern over reports that more than 100 civilians have been trapped in the village of Man Wai for the past three weeks, with inadequate access to food or medical supplies. A food convoy, organized by the Myanmar Red Cross, was reportedly prevented from entering the village last week. All parties to the conflict must allow the passage of humanitarian assistance, Ms. Lee said. Any wilful impediment of relief supplies may amount to war crimes under international law. In March, as the worlds attention was focused on the situation in Rakhine state and the Rohingya refugee crisis, the Special Rapporteur had raised alarm over deteriorating situation in Kachin, Shan and other conflict affected areas of Myanmar. In Kachin state, where sporadic violence and intermittent killings have been the norm in recent years, there has been an increase in the frequency and intensity of clashes between the Tatmadaw Myanmars armed forces] and Kachin Independence Army (KIA) since October 2017, resulting in deaths and the displacement of the civilian population, Ms. Lee said in her report to the Human Rights Council.
SpaceX Falcon Heavy, World's Most Powerful Rocket, Sends Sports Car Towards Mars: All You Need To Know  [SEP]  SpaceX Falcon Heavy, World's Most Powerful Rocket, Sends Sports Car Towards Mars: All You Need To Know SpaceX Falcon Heavy, the world's most powerful rocket, was launched today. The mission is a test flight, pioneered by rocket firm SpaceX which is helmed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.
Hurricane warning downgraded for Hawaii's Big Island  [SEP]  HILO, Hawaii (AP) — Forecasters on Wednesday downgraded Hurricane Madeline to a tropical storm as it veered past Hawaii’s Big Island, but officials reiterated warnings to prepare for heavy rain and strong winds. The National Weather Service downgraded the storm as its sustained winds fell below hurricane strength of 74 mph. By 5 p.m. (8 p.m. PDT), sustained winds swirled at 65 mph, and forecasters said continued weakening over the coming days was expected. Its center was passing to the south and wasn’t expected to make landfall on any Hawaiian island. Still, the Big Island and Maui County were under tropical storm warnings. “It doesn’t matter if it’s a strong tropical storm or a category 1 hurricane,” said Eric Lau, a meteorologist with the weather service. “If you have 70 mph winds versus 75 mph winds, it’s still a strong storm, so residents still need to be prepared.” Meanwhile, Hurricane Lester was about 1,000 miles from Hawaii and expected to drop to a tropical storm by Sunday. The developments came as merchants boarded up shop windows along Hilo Bay and shoppers snatched supplies of food and water from grocery store shelves after initially being told the island could be hit by its first hurricane in a quarter-century. “Hopefully our roofs stay on, and our houses don’t float way or get blown away,” Big Island resident Mitzi Bettencourt said as she covered walls of glass windows while the island was under the hurricane warning. “It’s like, ‘Oh my God, are we going to get flattened or what?'” Elsewhere, the National Hurricane Center said Tropical Storm Hermine had formed in the Gulf of Mexico and was centered about 315 miles from Tampa, Florida. It was expected to pick up speed and approach the northwest Florida coast Thursday night; a hurricane warning was issued for the area. A warning was dropped about a tropical depression that had been moving toward North Carolina. In Hawaii, Peggy Beckett, a retiree and beekeeper, stopped at a Hilo supermarket to pick up onion bagels, cheese, cold cuts and salad to add to her canned food at home. She also has a cooler with ice plus a portable burner and batteries to get her through the storm. Noting the lines of people at the market, Beckett said people were getting prepared but weren’t panicking. “There’s always a lot of disbelief on the island that the storms will really be as big and bad as forecast,” she said, noting that she and her partner had taken precautions to protect their beehives. Bettencourt manages several vacation rental properties, and her own home sits a few blocks from the ocean. She and her neighbors were stocking their pantries, stowing lawn furniture and preparing for power outages. Employees boarded up windows at Hulakai Store, a surf shop in Hilo. “We’ll probably keep it up till Sunday, waiting for the second one to come through,” said supervisor Renee Balanga. Gov. David Ige has issued an emergency proclamation for both storms, allowing the state to quickly spend money. Big Island schools were closed and about a dozen facilities were outfitted as emergency shelters. President Barack Obama is scheduled to visit Oahu this week. The White House was tracking the weather but didn’t anticipate changing Obama’s schedule. The Hawaiian islands of Maui, Molokai, Lanai and Kahoolawe were under a tropical storm watch, but there were no alerts for Oahu or Kauai. On the Big Island, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park was closed. The U.S. Coast Guard asked crews of barges and ships to prepare to leave Hilo Harbor and told ocean-going vessels to seek sheltered waters until storm conditions subside. Bussewitz reported from Honolulu. AP writers Jennifer Sinco Kelleher in Honolulu and Josh Lederman in Washington contributed to this report.

NKorea says launch tested ‘new type’ of cruise missile  [SEP]  SEOUL: Pyongyang on Friday hailed the successful test of a new type of surface-to-ship cruise missile, which it said was designed to hit “any enemy group of battleships” that threatened North Korea. The launch Thursday — the North’s fifth weapons test in a month — was overseen by leader Kim Jong-Un, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported, and came less than a week after the United Nations tightened sanctions against the Stalinist regime. “The launched cruise rockets accurately detected and hit the floating targets on the East Sea of Korea,” KCNA said, referring to the Sea of Japan — where two US aircraft carriers were on naval manoeuvres last week. The USS Carl Vinson and the USS Ronald Reagan led the three-day exercises that ended on June 3, with a total of a dozen US ships participating along with two Japanese vessels, in a show of force directed at North Korea. The US has stepped up its muscle-flexing in the region, with a US nuclear submarine, the 6,900-ton USS Cheyenne, whose home port is Pearl Harbor, also arriving in the South Korean port of Busan Tuesday. North Korea’s top newspaper Rodong Sinmun ran a front-page photo of a beaming Kim surrounded by smiling generals in uniform, with further pictures inside apparently showing the cruise missiles being launched from the back of a tank-like vehicle, and hitting ships at sea. North Korea has ordered three ballistic missile launches, a surface-to-air missile, and now Thursday’s cruise missile tests since South Korea’s new President Moon Jae-in took power in early May. Thursday’s short-range missiles flew some 200 kilometers (124 miles), which is an improvement on a 2015 test, when a surface-to-ship cruise missile flew only 100 kilometers, said Korea Defence Forum analyst Shin Jong-Woo. “This is another sign of meaningful progress in the North’s efforts to diversify its missiles. It will pose a considerable threat to US and South Korean navies,” he told Agence France-Presse. The new cruise missile represents a “a step forward in terms of accuracy and range”, analyst Kim Dong-Yub of the Kyungnam University Institute for Far Eastern Studies told Agence France-Presse. KCNA said the weapon tested Thursday had been part of the military parade in Pyongyang on April 15 to mark the birthday of the North’s founding father Kim Il-Sung. All of the weapons on display at the extravagant military parade have been tested in the past month, except for one that analysts said appeared to be an intercontinental ballistic missile, Yonhap news agency reported. Moon advocated reconciliation with Seoul’s isolated, unpredictable neighbour but has taken a more stern position in the wake of the missile tests, which pose a policy challenge to the new left-leaning leader. The launches come less than a week after the United Nations expanded sanctions against Kim Jong-Un’s regime in response to the recent ballistic missile tests. Diplomats at the United Nations denounced Thursday’s cruise missile launches as another provocation, though no immediate meeting of the Security Council is planned. Cruise missile tests do not contravene UN regulations, Korea Defence Network analyst Lee Il-Woo told AFP, adding they were “much slower than ballistic missiles and can be shot down by anti-aircraft guns.” Any North Korean tests using ballistic missile technology are banned by UN resolutions. However, the European Union on Thursday broadened its sanctions against North Korea over its work on nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. The EU said it would freeze the assets of 14 more people and ban their travel to Europe in line with a UN Security Council resolution last week for more sanctions over Pyongyang’s ballistic missile tests. The North has carried out two atomic tests and dozens of missile launches since the beginning of last year in its quest to develop a missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the continental United States — something President Donald Trump has vowed “won’t happen.”
10 civilians, including kids, dead in US-backed Somalia raid  [SEP]  MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) — Ten civilians, including three children, were killed in a raid by foreign and Somali forces on a farm in southern Somalia, a deputy governor said Friday as officials displayed victims’ bloodied bodies in the capital. The U.S. military confirmed it supported a Somali operation in the area. The farmers were killed “one by one” after soldiers stormed the farm in Barire village early Friday, the deputy governor of Lower Shabelle region, Ali Nur Mohamed, told reporters in Mogadishu. Three children aged 8 to 10 and a woman were among the dead, the official said, calling the attack a “real genocide.” Their blanket-wrapped bodies were laid out in a grassy courtyard for display. Bodies of civilians, especially those killed in misdirected attacks, often are taken from remote areas to Mogadishu to draw media attention. The U.S. Africa Command confirmed that U.S. forces were supporting the Somalia National Army while it conducted an operation in the area. It gave no details about the operation. The U.S. military has stepped up efforts this year against the Somalia-based extremist group al-Shabab, often in support of Somali forces. “These local farmers were attacked by foreign troops while looking after their crops,” the deputy governor told reporters. “The troops could have arrested them because they were unarmed but instead shot them one by one mercilessly.” A statement by Somalia’s information ministry said the raid on the farm killed eight al-Shabab fighters and that extremists began shooting at Somali forces after they entered. “No civilians were harmed or killed in this operation,” the statement said. Al-Shabab, which has become the deadliest Islamic extremist group in Africa, continues to hold vast areas of rural Somalia after being chased out of major cities in recent years by a multinational African Union force and Somali forces. The group continues to threaten the fragile central government and carry out deadly attacks in neighboring countries, notably Kenya. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump approved expanded military operations against al-Shabab, including more aggressive airstrikes and considering parts of southern Somalia areas of active hostilities. The U.S. and Somalia in recent weeks said strikes have killed al-Shabab leaders responsible for planning and executing deadly attacks in Mogadishu, where high-profile areas such as hotels and military checkpoints are often targeted with deadly bombings.

The Latest: Library patron says shooter told her to run  [SEP]  CLOVIS, N.M. (AP) - The Latest on a shooting inside a public library in Clovis that killed 2 and wounded 4 (all times local): A woman who was in the Clovis-Carver Public Library when a man killed two people and wounded four others says the man told her to run, the Eastern New Mexico News reports. Lisa Baird tells the newspaper (http://bit.ly/2wdMWOQ ) that she was about 20 feet from the man as he opened fire inside the library. "Run!," he yelled at her. "Why aren't you running? I'm shooting at you! Run!" Baird talked to the newspaper through Facebook Messenger. She says she was talking with a library patron when she says she heard a "very loud bang." "My initial thought was why would someone throw a cherry bomb or M80 firecracker into the library? Then I saw a young man aim his hand, which had a handgun in it, to the ground/carpet about 6 feet in front of him and he fired like four or five shots into the carpet." Baird says she dove under a nearby desk "and tried to squish up as small as possible." From there, Baird says she could hear the man moving around the library and firing multiple shots. "Then I heard his pants 'shooshing' as he approached the end of the reference desk. I heard a sound like a phone or something being put on the reference counter at the end of the desk, about 4 feet from my head." Then Baird says police entered the library and began shouting for the man with the gun to "lay on the ground" repeatedly. Police Chief Doug Ford says the suspect did not resist after police arrived. A shooting inside a public library that killed two people and wounded four has deeply shaken an eastern New Mexico community. Authorities and elected officials with the city of Clovis said during a news conference that the gunman surrendered after the shooting Monday and was taken into custody without incident after police entered the downtown building. Warrants for his arrest were being prepared. Clovis Mayor David Lansford says things could have been much worse had it not been for the quick response, training and courage of police. He calls the shooting tragic and senseless. "This is a big blow to our community," he said. Clovis, a city of about 40,000, is about 200 miles east of Albuquerque, near the Texas state line. The area is home to Cannon Air Force Base.
North Korea Threatens To Sink U.S. Carrier; China Urges Restraint  [SEP]  North Korea could reduce a U.S. strike force to a sea wreck if it's provoked, the country's propaganda outlets said Monday, adding to tensions on the Korean Peninsula. With the threat of a nuclear test in North Korea looming and another U.S. citizen reportedly detained there, China's President Xi Jinping is urging President Trump to avoid escalating the situation. The two leaders spoke by phone Monday, according to Chinese state media CCTV, which reports that Xi told Trump he "hopes all parties remain restrained instead of intensifying the situation." The phone call comes amid threats from North Korea that it will sink a U.S. Navy strike group that's led by the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier; it also follows reports from a North Korean university that one of its lecturers, who holds U.S. and South Korean citizenship, has been detained. "In a statement, [Pyongyang University of Science and Technology] said that its adjunct professor, 58-year-old Tony Kim, who also goes by Kim Sang-duk, was detained at the airport in Pyongyang as he was about to leave the country on Saturday local time," NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports. "The university said Kim's detention had nothing to do with his academic work. So far, North Korea has remained silent about Kim's detention." There is wide speculation that North Korea could be planning to carry out a nuclear test on Tuesday, timed to coincide with a celebration of its military's founding anniversary. On Monday, North Korea issued new threats against the U.S., which it accuses of plotting an invasion. From South Korea's Korea Herald comes this description of the regime's reaction to American warships sailing closer to the peninsula: The USS Carl Vinson's strike group is currently in the Philippine Sea, where it's taking part in joint exercises with Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force, including two Japanese destroyers. The Nimitz-class aircraft carrier was rerouted toward North Korea earlier this month, after initial confusion over its strike group's deployment — including a statement by President Trump that he was sending "an armada" to the Korean Peninsula. It's not yet clear why Kim might have been detained, other than as a possible bargaining tool for North Korea in international negotiations over its nuclear program and a dire need for imports of foodstuffs, coal, and other vital supplies — the bulk of which come from China. "China is very much the economic lifeline to North Korea," President Trump said in a tweet Friday, "so, while nothing is easy, if they want to solve the North Korean problem, they will." Kim is at least the third U.S. citizen in North Korea's custody. Most recently, University of Virginia student Otto Frederick Warmbier was arrested in early 2016 and sentenced to 15 years' hard labor over allegations that he tried to steal a propaganda poster at a hotel. Warmbier's sentence is nearly identical to that of missionary Kenneth Bae, who was released in 2014 along with his fellow American Matthew Todd Miller.
Aeroflot turbulence leaves passengers with fractures, bruises  [SEP]  24 Russians and 3 Thais were hurt, with some suffering serious fractures and bruising, when the plane unexpectedly hit an "air hole" during its approach to Suvarnabhumi Airport, according to the statement from Russian Embassy in Bangkok. "Some injured passengers were not wearing seat belts. All victims were taken to a local hospital with various injuries, mostly fractures and bruises. Some require surgery. Fifteen people remain hospitalized," the embassy said. Rostik Rusev, who is from Ukraine but lives in Hackensack, New Jersey, was on the flight and told CNN it was so bad it threw passengers out of their seats. "It lasted for about ten seconds, the plane was being thrown everywhere," Rusev told CNN. 3 hours ago I was on a Plane going From Moscow to Bangkok, out of nowhere we hit turbulence, that was so bad that it was throwing people around like crazy. Blood everywhere, people with broken bones, noses, open fractures, baby's with head injuries, I can keep going and going. Thank God we are Alive! I really hope @aeroflot @aeroflotrus will do right by everybody! I can honestly say I have never been so scared in my life before. #aeroflot #emergency. we are ok! "There was blood on the ceiling, people with broken noses, babies who were hurt, it was horrible. It came out of nowhere it was like driving a car and a tire suddenly bursts. "The aircraft personnel couldn't have been more professional and courageous. They were heroes in everything they were doing." Rusev also provided CNN with a photograph showing blood on an overhead compartment, which, he says, was the result of people being thrown out of their seats and hitting the ceiling. A passenger provided CNN with this photo of blood on one of the overhead compartments. Aeroflot issued a statement explaining the circumstances surrounding the incident, which occurred about 40 minutes before landing, saying that this type of turbulence known as "clear sky turbulence" is difficult to prepare for as "it does not occur in clouds but in clear skies with good visibility." The flight operator cited this as the reason passengers were not warned to return to their seats before adding that around 750 cases of clear sky turbulence occurs globally each year. Russian officials were at hospitals in the Thai capital providing translation and counseling assistance.

Review Times » Puzder exit dashes fast-food's hopes for seat at Trump table  [SEP]  NEW YORK (AP) — Fast-food’s hopes for representation in President Donald Trump’s Cabinet have been at least temporarily dashed, a major setback for an industry that has felt under siege in recent years. Andrew Puzder, CEO of the company that owns Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, on Wednesday withdrew his nomination to head the Labor Department, which is charged with protecting workers’ rights and welfare. A significant factor was a lack of support from some Senate Republicans, in part over taxes he only recently paid on a former housekeeper not authorized to work in the United States. Labor groups and advocates criticized Puzder’s comments about replacing workers with robots and his opposition to significant wage hikes, but industry executives and fast-food franchisees saw him as a figure who would champion their interests in the government. “I don’t necessarily know that we’ve been heard,” said Cicely Simpson, executive vice president of the National Restaurant Association, a trade group that had strongly backed Puzder’s nomination. Puzder had said that businesses were suffering under President Barack Obama’s administration, citing the health care overhaul that required employers to offer insurance coverage for full-time workers. Another change Puzder criticized would have expanded the number of employees eligible for overtime pay – a change that has since been blocked by a federal judge. Since late 2012, the Fight for $15 campaign has also targeted companies like McDonald’s and Wendy’s, galvanized support for minimum wage increases around the country and pushed for changes that were seen as potentially paving the way for fast-food workers to unionize. Although the wage increases many restaurant operators have dealt with were enacted at the state or local level, Obama’s Labor Secretary’s Tom Perez had been a high-profile supporter of Fight for $15. Trump’s tapping of Puzder in December to head the Labor Department seemed to mark a shift, and the industry enthusiastically supported him. That included pushing back against a coalition of labor groups including the Fight for $15, which sprang into action to oppose Puzder’s nomination with protests at Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s stores and a social media campaign. Kendall Fells, national organizing director for the Fight for $15, said the social media push was successful enough that Puzder’s Twitter account blocked multiple coalition supporters. Judy Conti, federal advocacy coordinator for the pro-labor National Employment Law Project, said the restaurant industry has a high rate of labor violations, and could benefit enormously if the Labor Department were to ease up on enforcements. She said the public pressure that helped prompt Puzder’s withdrawal sent an important message to workers. George Thompson, Puzder’s spokesman, said his boss was a victim of “an unprecedented smear campaign.” White House spokesman Sean Spicer said he had no information on any possible replacement nominee. The National Restaurant Association said it hoped Trump’s replacement nominee would have experience creating jobs. Troi Wierdsma, a franchisee with 180 Carl’s Jr. locations in California, had said in December that she was sleeping better with Puzder’s nomination. She cited the changes under the Obama administration, such as requirement for employers to provide health care to full-time workers. Puzder has said that had prompted restaurants to cut workers’ hours, forcing them to get second jobs. Arby’s CEO Paul Brown noted in an interview last month that minimum wages are mostly decided at a local level, but that Puzder’s appointment could mean the restaurant industry wouldn’t see significant new regulations for some time. Brown said that could give franchisees and others a chance to figure out how to adjust to the ones passed in recent years. “One of the challenges for the past several years is that things were happening so fast,” Brown said. Nigel Travis, CEO of the company that owns Dunkin’ Donuts, also said that many of the issues franchisees are facing happen at the local level, but that owners nevertheless have felt frustrated by regulations in recent years.
Pentagon pushes for new, low-yield nuclear weapons  [SEP]  The US military wants to revamp its nuclear arsenal and develop new low-yield atomic weapons, largely in response to Russian actions in recent years, the Pentagon said in a policy statement released Friday. The so-called Nuclear Posture Review outlines the Pentagon's nuclear ambitions under President Donald Trump and is the first time since 2010 that the military has spelled out how it foresees nuclear threats in the coming decades. "The strategy develops capabilities aimed at making use of nuclear weapons less likely," Trump said in a statement. "It enhances deterrence of strategic attacks against our Nation, and our allies and partners, that may not come in the form of nuclear weapons." "And, importantly, it reaffirms our commitment to arms control and nuclear non-proliferation, maintains the moratorium on nuclear testing, and commits to improving efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to nuclear terrorism," he said. The document marks a sobering break from the vision for America's atomic future under Barack Obama, who during a famous speech in Prague in 2009 called for the elimination of nuclear weapons. While it underscores the administration's concerns about North Korea, Iran and China, the focus falls largely on Russia. "This is a response to Russian expansion of their capability and the nature of their strategy and doctrine," Defense Secretary Jim Mattis wrote in the introduction to the 75-page document. "These developments, coupled with Russia's seizure of Crimea and nuclear threats against our allies, mark Moscow's decided return to Great Power competition," he also wrote. The Pentagon worries Russia assumes America's regular, large-yield weapons are essentially too big to ever be detonated, as their use would likely result in large-scale retaliation and wipe much of humanity off the map. "There are strong indications that our current strategy posture and capabilities are perceived by the Russians as potentially inadequate to deter them," Greg Weaver, the deputy director of strategic capabilities for the military's Joint Staff, told reporters. "The US and NATO require a wider range of credible low-yield nuclear options to do a very specific thing: to convince the Russian leadership that if they initiate limited nuclear use, in a war with the alliance, our response will deny them the objective they seek and impose costs that far outweigh those benefits they can achieve," he added. - More reliance on subs and ships - The document, an earlier version of which was leaked last month, says that by having additional smaller nukes, the Pentagon can counter adversaries' "misperceptions" that the United States would not respond to another country using its own low-yield bomb. The new strategy calls for a continuation of the nuclear modernization program ordered by Obama that encompasses all pillars of the "triad" -- ground-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched weapons and bombs delivered by plane. But unlike the Obama strategy, which stressed reducing the role of nuclear weapons, the new policy has a more assertive tone. Low-yield nuclear weapons, also known as "tactical" nukes, are still extremely powerful and can pack as much destructive punch as the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II. America already has a massive nuclear arsenal at its disposal, including 150 B-61 nukes stored across multiple European countries that can be configured for low-yield options. The new weapons envisioned by the Pentagon would be launchable from submarines or ships, so would not need to be stockpiled in Europe. They could also get around Russian air defenses more easily. The bombs would not add to America's nuclear horde, and would instead repurpose existing warheads, but critics say the Pentagon would be going against the spirit of non-proliferation agreements. "We are on the cusp of a new era of nuclear proliferation," warned Barry Blechman, co-founder of the Stimson Center, a nonpartisan anti-nuclear proliferation think tank in Washington. "This is the great nuclear danger raised by the new" nuclear policy. Weaver disputed media accounts that the nuclear posture review lowered the threshold for America to use nuclear weapons. "The purpose of these capabilities is to make a US response to nuclear use more credible, not to make US first use more likely," he said.
Elon Musk threatens to ditch Trump's advisory council over Paris climate treaty withdrawal  [SEP]  Amid news reports that President Donald Trump is preparing to pull the US out of the Paris climate treaty on Wednesday, Tesla CEO and member of Trump's economic advisory council, Elon Musk, threatened to step down as an adviser if the president went through with the withdrawal. Musk took to Twitter to insist he had done all he could to convince Trump to remain in the accord. When asked what he would do if his efforts went unheeded, the Tesla CEO said he would have no choice but to leave: Musk is among a growing list of executives, Republicans, and oil industry leaders urging Trump to remain in the treaty that 195 countries have signed. In December, Musk attracted widespread criticism for his decision to serve on Trump's advisory team, which includes other heads of powerful companies such as Disney and Walmart. While he previously expressed reservations regarding Trump's fitness for the Oval Office, Musk would later rationalize his decision to advise Trump as his effort to provide a "voice of reason" in the increasingly erratic administration. On Wednesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer refused to confirm mounting reports of Trump's plan to pull out of the agreement. When asked specifically about Musks' threat, Spicer told reporters, "Let's wait and see what the president's decision is."
Israeli Army Chief: Hezbollah Leader Killed by His Own Men  [SEP]  Israel has concluded that Hezbollah's top military commander was killed in Syria last year by rivals within the Shiite militant group, Israel's military chief said Tuesday. The explosive announcement was the latest sign of an escalating feud between Israel and Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed group sworn to Israel's destruction. Israel considers Hezbollah to be a potent enemy, with over 100,000 rockets and missiles aimed at the Jewish state. But it also believes the group has been weakened and demoralized after years of fighting alongside President Bashar Assad's forces in Syria. Israel's military chief, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, told an academic conference on Tuesday that the death of Mustafa Badreddine last May illustrated "the depth of the internal crisis within Hezbollah." He also said it reflected "the extent of the cruelty, complexity and tension between Hezbollah and its patron Iran." An Israeli military official said Israel believes the order to kill Badreddine was given by Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah. Israeli intelligence believes Badreddine had been feuding with Iranian military commanders in Syria over the heavy losses his group had suffered on the battlefield. Both Iran and Hezbollah are backing Syrian government forces. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was discussing a confidential intelligence assessment. Hezbollah had no immediate comment. At the time of his death last year, Hezbollah said Badreddine had been killed by insurgent shelling in Syria. He was considered Hezbollah's top military official and was among five members on trial in absentia at a court in the Netherlands over the bombing that killed former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and 21 others in Beirut in 2005. Badreddine was a student of Imad Mughniyeh, Hezbollah's previous military chief, who was considered one of the world's most-wanted terrorists by Israel and the United States. Mughniyeh, who was Badreddine's brother-in-law, was killed in a 2008 car bombing in Damascus that Hezbollah blamed on Israel. Israel and Hezbollah fought a monthlong war in 2006 that ended in a stalemate. Israeli officials say that Hezbollah is far stronger than it was back then and battle-tested after years of fighting in neighboring Syria. They frequently warn that it is only a matter of time before another war breaks out. But Israeli officials also say the group does not want a confrontation with Israel right now. Hezbollah has gotten bogged down in the Syrian fighting and is believed to have lost hundreds of fighters. Israel is not actively involved in the Syrian fighting. But it keeps close tabs on the battlefield actions of its enemies, Iran and Hezbollah. Israel is believed to have carried out numerous airstrikes in Syria aimed at suspected weapons shipments destined for Hezbollah. On Tuesday, the Israeli military confirmed that a "Skylark" surveillance drone crashed in Syria earlier this week. It gave no cause for the crash and said the incident was being investigated, but said there was "no risk of a breach of information." Hezbollah's media arm published photographs of what it said was a drone it had shot down in Syrian airspace in the Golan Heights. Last week, Israel shot down a Syrian anti-aircraft missile fired at an Israeli aircraft carrying out an airstrike on a suspected Hezbollah weapons convoy in Syria.
Israeli PM: Airstrikes dealt 'severe blows' to Iran, Syria  [SEP]  JERUSALEM (AP) - Israel's prime minister said Sunday his country delivered "severe blows" to Iranian and Syrian forces and vowed to take further action against its adversaries following the most serious Israeli engagement in Syria since the war there erupted almost seven years ago. Benjamin Netanyahu's tough words to his Cabinet came a day after Israel carried out a wave of airstrikes in Syria. Israel ordered the airstrikes after it intercepted an Iranian drone that had infiltrated its airspace, and an Israeli F-16 was downed upon its return from Syria. "Yesterday we dealt severe blows to the Iranian and Syrian forces," Netanyahu said. "We made it unequivocally clear to everyone that our rules of action have not changed one bit. We will continue to strike at every attempt to strike at us. This has been our policy and it will remain our policy." Israel has tried to stay on the sidelines since civil war broke out in neighboring Syria in 2011, though it has periodically carried out airstrikes against suspected weapons shipments believed to be headed for Lebanese Hezbollah, the Iranian and Syrian-allied militant group. But as the Syrian war winds down, Israeli officials have voiced increasing alarm that Iran and its Shiite allies are establishing a permanent presence in Syria that could turn its aim toward Israel. Israeli leaders said the airstrikes had sent a clear message to Iran. "We do not just talk, we act," said Cabinet Minister Yoav Galant, a former Israeli deputy chief of staff and member of Netanyahu's Security Cabinet. "I think that also the Syrians now understand well that the fact that they are hosting the Iranians on Syrian soil harms them," he told The Associated Press. Saturday's airstrikes marked the toughest Israeli aerial assault in Syria in decades. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war in Syria through a network of activists on the ground, said Sunday that at least six Syrian troops and allied militiamen were killed in the airstrikes. The six included Syrian and non-Syrian allied troops, the Britain-based Observatory said. "They, and we, know what we hit and it will take them some time for them to digest, understand and ask how Israel knew how to hit those sites," Israel's Intelligence Minister Israel Katz told the Army Radio station. "These were concealed sites and we have intelligence agencies and the ability to know everything that is going on there and yesterday we proved that." In Saturday's attacks, the Israeli jets came under heavy Syrian anti-aircraft fire and the pilots of one of the F-16s had to eject before the plane crashed in northern Israel. One pilot was seriously wounded and the other one lightly. Israel would not confirm whether its aircraft was shot down by enemy fire, which would mark the first such instance for Israel since 1982, when it was fighting a war in neighboring Lebanon. Israel has recently issued several stern warnings about the increased Iranian involvement along its borders with Syria and Lebanon. Israel fears Iran could use Syrian territory to stage attacks or create a land corridor from Iran to Lebanon that could allow it to transfer weapons more easily to Hezbollah - a powerful Iran-backed Shiite militant group sworn to Israel's destruction. Though Israel has largely stayed out of the Syrian conflict, it has struck weapons convoys destined for Hezbollah dozens of times since 2012. Israel has also shot down several drones that previously tried to infiltrate its territory from Syria, but the capture of an Iranian drone and the direct targeting of Iranian sites in response marked a dramatic escalation in the Israeli retaliation. Israel has long complained about the involvement of archenemy Iran, and Iranian proxy Hezbollah, in the Syria war. Both have sent forces to back Assad, who appears headed toward victory. Israel has said it will not accept a permanent military presence by Iran and its Shiite allies in Syria, especially near the Israeli border. Netanyahu has held several consultations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has also sent forces to back Assad. Following the Israeli strikes, the two spoke again on Saturday, with Netanyahu conveying Israel's determination to counter Iran's intentions. Still, Russia's foreign ministry appeared to criticize Israel's actions by calling for restraint and respecting Syria's sovereignty. "It is absolutely unacceptable to create threats to the lives and security of Russian servicemen who are in Syria at the invitation of its legitimate government," it said. The United States, on the other hand, strongly backed Israel. Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, said Iranian actions across the region were putting the entire Middle East at risk. "The U.S. continues to push back on the totality of Iran's malign activities in the region and calls for an end to Iranian behavior that threatens peace and stability," she said. Associated Press writer Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.
Watch: Winston Peters labels National leader's question 'unadulterated nonsense' as fuel tax debate ignites in Beehive  [SEP]  Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters and National leader Simon Bridges have clashed over fuel taxes in Parliament's question time today. Mr Peters was answering questions on behalf of the absent Jacinda Ardern, who is awaiting the arrival of her first baby, and was asked by National Party leader Simon Bridges if the Prime Minister was concerned that her Government has increased the cost of living in New Zealand. "The basis of that question is unadulterated nonsense," Mr Peters replied. Undeterred Mr Bridges pushed on, stating the new Auckland fuel tax would increase costs to an average family by $700 a year. "Again that is unadulterated rubbish," Mr Peters said, accusing Mr Bridges of being inconsistent after wanting to extend road infrastructure around the country himself. Mr Bridges then suggested that the fuel tax set to be implemented in Auckland has today been legislated by Government to be applied throughout any region in New Zealand. Mr Peters suggested that people are happy to pay a fuel tax rather than a blanket increase in GST while also stating that other councils cannot put a fuel tax in place until 2021.
Volcano in southern Japan erupts for 1st time in 250 years  [SEP]  TOKYO (AP) — A volcano in southern Japan has erupted for the first time in 250 years, and authorities set up a no-go zone around the mountain. Mount Io spewed smoke and ash high into the sky Thursday in its first eruption since 1768. Japan’s Meteorological Agency on Friday expanded a no-go zone to the entire mountain from previously just around the volcano’s crater. Explosions have briefly subsided Friday, but officials cautioned residents in nearby towns against falling volcanic rocks and ash. The volcano is part of the Kirishima mountain range on Japan’s southern main island of Kyushu. The area is about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) southwest of Tokyo. Another volcano nearby also erupted violently in March for the first time in seven years. Japan sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and has 110 active volcanoes.

7 things to know about Lebanon's parliament elections  [SEP]  7 things to know about Lebanon's parliament elections Almost everyone in the country complains about it. The same political dynasties dominating year after year, and politicians work for their sect, or their own families. No one has repaired an electricity system that's been decrepit for decades or organized the proper collection of garbage because of business feuds. It's also a tough system to change. Each community fears losing power or patronage. After the 1975-1990 civil war, the balance between Shiites, Sunnis and Christians — the main sects among 18 official ones — preserves a stability that always seems on the verge of collapse, but, for the past decade at least, has not. Here are seven things to know about the system ahead of Sunday's parliamentary elections. It's the first time the Lebanese are voting for a parliament in nine years and the first election held since the outbreak of the Syrian war in 2011. The vote has been postponed a number of times over concerns it would ignite tensions among Lebanon's sects, already heightened by that war. Lawmakers have haggled over election reform for years, finally passing a new law last summer to replace one in place since 1960. The law allows expats to vote for the first time. Of 900,000 voters abroad, only 83,000 registered and just over half of them voted last week. There are a total of 3.6 million registered voters. For the first time, women make up nearly 10 percent of the candidates, up from a meager 1.7 percent in 2009. Only four women made it to Lebanon's 128-seat parliament in the last election, a dismal figure compared to other countries in the region. Also, a record number of civil society activists and independents are running, hoping to at least open a crack in Lebanon's system. The new election law is so complex that some say they would rather stay at home because they can't figure out how their vote will be computed. The law implements a proportional system that awards seats by the share of vote received, instead of the former winner-takes-all system in each district. It reduces the number of electoral constituencies from 23 to 15, and allows voters to choose both an electoral list and a preferred candidate from that list. In theory, it should allow candidates beyond traditional power players to win seats. But it also preserves the sectarian divvying-up of seats in different districts; Muslims and Christians each get around half, and smaller communities the remainder. THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM Lebanon's strongest political party is the only one with an active militia: Hezbollah. The Iranian-backed Shiite faction has thousands of fighters in Syria supporting President Bashar Assad, an intervention that is deeply divisive in Lebanon. Sunnis largely sympathize with the rebels trying to bring Assad down and resent Hezbollah's political domination and its armed wing, which is more powerful than the national military. But that issue has been too sensitive to feature in the current election. Instead, many have focused on calls for the return of more than a million Syrian refugees, saying they threaten the sectarian balance and burden local infrastructure. Even though the civil war ended 28 years ago, politics are still dominated by former warlords and family dynasties, who have always been able to settle elections before voters get to the polls. Some are virtually untouchable. The 80-year-old parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, a Shiite who has held the post for more than 25 years, is running virtually uncontested. Others are now passing their seats on to their children. Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, 68, has stepped aside for his son, Taymour. The seat of Suleiman Frangieh, a 52-year-old Maronite Christian leader who is seen as a potential presidential candidate, is going to his son Tony. Michelle Tueni, daughter of lawmaker and journalist Gibran Tueni, who was assassinated in a 2005 car bomb, is also running. One Lebanese website listed second generation politicians running to replace their fathers, then posted pictures of their toddler children, captioned: "Your parliament members for 2025." For the disenfranchised and the forgotten, election season is a chance to get noticed. Manal Kortam is running, but only symbolically — she has no right to run or vote because she's Palestinian. Actually, her mother is Lebanese, but under Lebanese law women cannot pass down citizenship. There are about 174,000 registered Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, many of them descendants of those who fled to the country after the creation of Israel in 1948. They have no citizenship and few rights, are highly restricted in where they can work, and are often seen as a disruption to the delicate sectarian balance. Kortam took to social media with her #WeExist campaign, touring refugee camps and speaking on TV "so they get ready to deal with us after the elections," as she put it on her Twitter account. Prime Minister Saad Hariri has plastered pictures of himself — and his assassinated father whose political mantle he inherited — all over Beirut, including at its landmark seaside Ferris wheel. He's now being referred to as "the selfie prime minister," and he even created a selfie app. Some of his supporters have painted sheep and camels blue, the campaign color of his Future Movement, and paraded them along streets before slaughtering them, sparking outrage from rights activists. It's a sign that his movement, a bastion of Sunnis, is struggling. The new election law opens up room for other Sunnis to garner votes, and Hariri has faced criticism over his close ties with Shiite Hezbollah, on whose support he relies for his post. As it became clear the new election law would likely do little to change the system, many responded with grim humor. A group of clowns known as "Clown Me In" has been mocking campaign slogans. "It is time!" one Christian party's campaign posters proclaimed. "It is time for popcorn," countered a red-nosed clown in an online meme. A Twitter account listed 12 octogenarian candidates and pronounced them The List of "We Belong to God and to Him we all return" — a local saying for the deceased. Two artists, Michelle and Noel Keserwany, struck a chord with a music video urging young people to make new choices and break the cycle. Its refrain: "Here we go again, here we go again."
Iran launches missiles at Syria, but message is aimed at U.S., Israel  [SEP]  TEHRAN, Iran — When Iran launched ballistic missiles into Syria Monday, its message was aimed more at the Islamic Republic's powerful foes: the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia. The country’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard said it had targeted militants it blames for a recent attack on a military parade that killed at least 24 and wounded dozens in Ahvaz in southwestern Iran. But a missile shown on state TV Monday bore the phrase "Death to America, Death to Israel, Death to Al Saud," referring to Saudi Arabia's ruling family. An Iranian state TV reporter did not mince words. "In a few minutes, the world of arrogance — especially America, the Zionist regime and the Al Saud — will hear the sound of Iran's repeated blows," he said as a missile roared into the night sky behind him. While Tehran's relationships with Israel, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. have not been good since the revolution that ousted the Shah of Iran in 1979, tensions have ratcheted up recently. The U.S., Israel and Gulf monarchies are resisting Iran’s moves to entrench in Iraq, Lebanon, Afghanistan and Syria, where it is one of President Bashar al-Assad's main supporters. Despite that pressure, Tehran is doubling down, according to Sanam Vakil, an adjunct professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies Europe. “Iran generally has a model of asymmetric attacks,” she said. “It doesn’t respond kind-for-kind, but a bit like whack-a-mole in another theater. It wouldn’t respond directly to Saudi Arabia or directly the United States, but the messaging goes out to U.S. or Gulf opponents.” Tensions have been increasing for months, especially since President Donald Trump withdrew from the landmark Obama-era nuclear agreement with Iran. Since then, the U.S. has slapped painful sanctions on Iran and threatened to stop the country from exporting oil. Joining the U.S. is Sunni Muslim regional power Saudi Arabia, which along with other Gulf monarchies views Shiite Iran as deeply hostile. The two are engaged in a number of proxy conflicts — including in Yemen. Israel, meanwhile, considers Iran its biggest threat, and has launched hundreds of airstrikes to curtail Iranian forces and Iran-backed Lebanese militia Hezbollah in Syria, and keep them away from its northern border. Ali Fathollah-Nejad, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center and an associate with the Iran Project at Harvard University, said Tehran was also taking advantage of the attacks to test its controversial weapons program. "Iran has been using those incidents to test its ballistic missiles, thus circumventing international criticism as its strikes are considered responses against terrorist perpetrators of those attacks," he said. Iran also says its enemies foment unrest and violence inside the country, and has pinned the blame for the Ahvaz attacks on foreign powers. In a statement released Monday, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard said "terrorists" targeted in Syria are supported by U.S., Israel and Saudi Arabia. “These three governments are engaging in supporting terrorists inside Iran,” according to Foad Izadi, professor of world studies at the University of Tehran. “There are a number of tools available to Iranian authorities to make sure terrorism does not happen again, and using ballistic missiles is just a tool out of many.” Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has blamed regional countries and their "U.S. masters" for funding and arming the separatists who are thought to be behind the Ahvaz attack. But Brian Hook, Washington's special representative for Iran, told reporters last week that Tehran should "be worried more about protecting the security of their own people than blaming others.” He also described the accusations leveled at the U.S., Israel and Saudi Arabia as "so predictable it's laughable." Underscoring increased tensions, National Security Adviser John Bolton last week warned Iran, "If you cross us, our allies, or our partners; if you harm our citizens; if you continue to lie, cheat, and deceive, yes, there will indeed be hell to pay." On Friday, the State Department announced it was closing the U.S. consular outpost in the southern Iraq city of Basra and evacuating its diplomatic staff following days of violence. On Saturday, Iranian TV broadcast footage supposedly showing a close encounter between the Revolutionary Guard's navy and the USS Theodore Roosevelt. In the video of the encounter, which PressTV's website says occurred March 21, Iranian speedboats are seen closing in on the U.S. carrier. The missile launch and video of the U.S.-Iran maritime encounter follow a broadside by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the U.N. On Thursday, at the United Nations General Assembly, he accused Iran of keeping a "secret atomic warehouse" just outside its capital, despite the 2015 deal with world powers meant to prevent it obtaining nuclear weapons. Israel considers Iran its biggest threat and long objected to the nuclear pact. It cites Tehran's calls for Israel's destruction, and the development of long-range missiles as evidence of this hostility. “Tensions do seem to be heating up. Netanyahu is on a rampage,” Vakil said. “He’s not relenting in the U.N. He continues to hammer it home about their underhand nuclear intentions.” She pointed out that the Israelis had struck Iranian interests in Syria over 100 times in the past year and warned that such overlapping interests and tensions carried a chance of spinning out of control. “The problem is that these flashpoints aren’t just located in Syria,” Vakil added. “There is possible escalation in Iraq and in Yemen or in the Gulf. There are multiple theaters where escalations could result." Ali Arouzi reported from Tehran, and F. Brinley Bruton from London.
Ohio State campus secure after active shooter killed by police  [SEP]  A gunman at the Ohio State University campus in Columbus was killed by law enforcement this morning after nine people were hospitalized, none evidently with life-threatening injuries.OSU security declared the campus secure around 11:30 a.m. Eastern time. Classes at the university remain cancelled for the rest of the day.Based on The Columbus Dispatch's report , it's still unclear if there may be a second suspect:
Member states allow chemical watchdog to assign blame for attacks  [SEP]  Member states allow chemical watchdog to assign blame for attacks THE HAGUE: In a diplomatic victory for Britain, countries voted by a wide margin yesterday to give the world’s chemical weapons watchdog new powers to assign blame for attacks with banned toxic munitions. In a special session, member states of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) voted in favor of a British-led proposal to grant the new powers by a 82-24 margin, easily reaching the two-thirds majority needed for it to succeed. The motion was supported by the United States and European Union, but opposed by Russia, Iran, Syria and their allies. “The international community has come together to strengthen the ban against chemical weapons use,” Britain’s foreign office said in a statement immediately following the vote. Though the use of chemical weapons is illegal under international law, the taboo on deploying them has been eroding after their repeated use in the Syrian civil war, but also in Iraq, Malaysia and Britain since 2012. From 2015 to 2017 a joint United Nations-OPCW team had been appointed to assign blame for chemical attacks in Syria. It found that Syrian government troops used nerve agent sarin and chorine barrel bombs on several occasions, while Islamic State militants were found to have used sulphur mustard. But at a deadlocked UN Security Council, the joint team was disbanded last year after Moscow used its veto to block several resolutions seeking to renew its mandate. The British proposal declares the OPCW will be empowered to attribute blame for attacks, though details of how it will do so will still need to be further defined by the organizations’ members.–Reuters
4 killed in Pennsylvania car wash shooting  [SEP]  Four people, who were all in their 20s, have been shot and killed Sunday at a southern Pennsylvania car wash. The shooting happened about 3 a.m. ET in the village of Melcroft, 42 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, according to Pennsylvania State Police. Officers found four bodies and two injured people – including the suspected gunman, identified as Timothy Smith, 28. As of late Monday morning, Smith remained on life support and wasn’t expected to survive a gunshot wound to his head, said Trooper Robert Broadwater, spokesman for the Pennylvania State Police. “It is a possibility that the gunshot wound to Smith was self-inflicted, however that determination has not been made at this point,” according to the police report. Smith was wearing a body armor carrier without the ballistic panels inserted. He had several magazines of ammunition and three firearms – an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, 9 mm handgun and .308-caliber rifle, police said. Smith apparently shot the victims with the AR-15 and the 9 mm, police said. Citing the ongoing investigation, officials said at a press conference they couldn’t comment on the relationship between Smith and the four victims and haven’t released a potential motive. One of the victims, Chelsie Cline, had briefly been involved with Smith but broke things off months ago, her sister, Sierra Kolarik, told WPXI. Broadwater would not say how the shooter and victims knew each other but said the families had been helpful in piecing those relationships together. Cell phone records will help investigators in that respect, as well as with nailing down the shooter’s motive, he said. The victims, Chelsie, 25, William Scott Porterfield, 27, Courtney Sue Snyder, 23, and Seth William Cline, 21, were shot after they arrived at the self-serve car wash in two cars. Porterfield and Chelsie arrived together, got out of the car and walked to the side of the business, where they were both killed, police said. Snyder and Seth arrived in a pickup truck, and they were both shot inside their vehicle while it was stopped. While shots were being fired into the front of the vehicle, a woman who had been riding in the back seat was able to hide and survived with minor injuries from breaking glass, police said. “She is cooperating with the investigation,” said Sgt. Jeremy Barni of Pennsylvania State Police. “Obviously, it’s a traumatic experience for her.”
Labour brands criticism `absurd´ after ex-chief rabbi hits out at...  [SEP]  Labour is facing a fresh storm over allegations of anti-Semitism at the top of the party after former chief rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks compared Jeremy Corbyn’s comments on Zionists with Enoch Powell’s inflammatory “rivers of blood” speech. Lord Sacks’ scathing remarks, in which he branded Mr Corbyn an “anti-Semite” who “supported racists, terrorists, and dealers of hate” drew an angry response from Labour. Condemnation of the Leader of the Opposition by the crossbench peer, who served as chief rabbi between 1991–2013, comes just a week before Labour’s ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) again considers its code of conduct on anti-Semitism. Labour hit back at the comments by branding them “absurd and offensive”. Lord Sacks remarks came after footage from 2013 emerged of Mr Corbyn attacking a group of British Zionists who had criticised Palestinian ambassador Manuel Hassassian. Mr Corbyn said: “They clearly have two problems. “One is they don’t want to study history, and secondly, having lived in this country for a very long time, probably all of their lives, they don’t understand English irony either.” Lord Sacks told the New Statesman: “The recently disclosed remarks by Jeremy Corbyn are the most offensive statement made by a senior British politician since Enoch Powell’s 1968 ‘rivers of blood’ speech. “It was divisive, hateful and like Powell’s speech it undermines the existence of an entire group of British citizens by depicting them as essentially alien. “We can only judge Jeremy Corbyn by his words and his actions. “He has given support to racists, terrorists and dealers of hate who want to kill Jews and remove Israel from the map. “When he implies that, however long they have lived here, Jews are not fully British, he is using the language of classic pre-war European anti-Semitism. “When challenged with such facts, the evidence for which is before our eyes, first he denies, then he equivocates, then he obfuscates. “He has legitimised the public expression of hate, and where he leads, others will follow. “Now, within living memory of the Holocaust, and while Jews are being murdered elsewhere in Europe for being Jews, we have an anti-Semite as the leader of the Labour Party and Her Majesty’s Opposition. “That is why Jews feel so threatened by Mr Corbyn and those who support him.” A Labour Party spokesperson said: “This comparison with the race-baiting Enoch Powell is absurd and offensive. “Jeremy Corbyn described a particular group of pro-Israel activists as Zionists, in the accurate political sense, not as a synonym or code for Jewish people. “Jeremy Corbyn is determined to tackle anti-Semitism both within the Labour Party and in wider society and the Labour Party is committed to rebuilding trust with the Jewish community.” The Labour leader has previously said that his remarks had been defending the ambassador from “what I thought were deliberate misrepresentations” by people “for whom English was a first language, when it isn’t for the ambassador”.

India should be prepared for war with China, says Ramdev  [SEP]  Amid the escalating strain in the relationship between and China, Yoga guru on Sunday reiterated that needs to be prepared on all fronts for a possible war with China, if they don't reciprocate on peaceful terms. Addressing the World Peace and Harmony Conclave, Ramdev said, "If was open to the idea of peace, then the Dalai Lama wouldn't have been here." He said that has retaliated with a war threat every time approached on peaceful terms, and asked Indians to answer them on the same front. "We should be ready with any kind of answer they seek. If they don't understand peace, we should answer them with war," he said. He also said that is an epitome of "promoting war and hatred" in the world, further reiterating his appeal to boycott Chinese goods. "All the Indians who feel for their country should boycott Chinese goods immediately." Earlier, Ramdev had asked all the people in the country to ban Chinese products which would reduce their market in the country. "Indians should strictly ban the purchase of Chinese products. This will reduce their market in our country and they would be compelled to step back," he said. Ramdev further asserted that Chinese companies have captured Indian market with their electronic goods, automobiles, toys and several others. Meanwhile, Indian and Chinese troops are still locked in the month-long standoff in Doklam and both sides have moved additional troops, ammunition and military equipment to the area. The stand-off emerged after Chinese troops were stopped by the Indian Army from constructing roads at the Doklam border.
African Union Criticizes US Anti-Muslim Travel Ban  [SEP]  Alwaght- African countries slammed US president's provocative move to ban citizens of seven Muslim majority countries from traveling to the country. Members of the African Union concluded their 28th Summit early Wednesday by criticizing US President Donald Trump's ban on immigrants and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries. Two members of the Union, Somali and Sudan were affected by the executive order signed by Trump on Friday. Libya. Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen are also on the list. President Alpha Conde of Guinea, who was elected new chairman of the African Union, expressed solidarity with Somali and Sudan. Conde said the summit "showed the solidarity spirit of the continent to the world." During the session, Chad’s Foreign Minister Moussa Faki Mahamat was elected to replace Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, who stepped down after four years at the helm of the African Union Commission. And Ghana’s Ambassador Thomas Kwesi Quartey was elected deputy chairperson. Dlamini-Zuma condemned the ban as racist act on his Twitter account, saying “the very country to whom our people were taken as slaves have now decided to ban refugees from some of our countries.” Dlamini-Zuma had expressed concern about Trump's presidency, saying it "could affect the global advances made in the fight for gender equality, as well as combatting climate change". The session was also affected by reports that Morocco's readmission to the union may divide the union. Morocco was readmitted to the African Union on Monday following an absence of more than three decades. In 1984, Morocco left the Organization of African Unity, the predecessor of the AU, after the union formally recognized the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic in the Western Sahara region, which Rabat considers Moroccan territory.

Fire Again Devastates Scotland’s Mackintosh Building  [SEP]  A major fire has torn through one of Scotland’s architectural gems, the Mackintosh building at the Glasgow School of Art, for the second time in four years. More than 120 firefighters fought the blaze during the night as it gutted the 1909 building and spread to a theater and a nearby nightclub. No casualties were reported. “The extent of the damage is very severe,” Peter Heath, deputy assistant chief officer of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, told reporters at the scene in Glasgow city center Saturday morning. The fire “has reached from the ground floor right through to the roof,” he said. By morning the fire was under control, but smoke was still rising from the building as firefighters sprayed it from tall ladders. Heath said the theater was still on fire and its roof had partly collapsed, but the blaze was no longer spreading. The Mackintosh building had been scheduled to reopen next year after millions of pounds in restoration works following a fire in May 2014. “My first thoughts tonight are for the safety of people, but my heart also breaks for Glasgow’s beloved School of Art,” Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Twitter. The Mackintosh building is named after its architect, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Scotland’s most influential designer. The School of Art’s website says the building “heralded the birth of a new style in 20th century European architecture.” Heath said fire crews were called about 20 minutes before midnight Friday, and by the time they arrived fire had spread to the whole building. The area was quickly evacuated and cordoned off. It remained inaccessible to the public Saturday morning. “This is a devastating loss for Glasgow, absolutely devastating,” Heath said.
Looking for art's next big thing? Head to Venice  [SEP]  Halfway through her second eight-hour day of looking at art in the Venice Biennale, took a break outside the Punta Della Dogana, an exhibition space on the Grand Canal. “It’s been interesting to understand what the art world thinks is relevant,” said Maramotti, the senior director of North American retail for Max Mara Ltd, which was founded by her grandfather. “I’ll go home knowing about some artists who I wouldn’t have necessarily thought about collecting, but who now I think could be interesting as a part of the Collezione Maramotti,” the family art collection based in Reggio Emilia, Over the course of one week in May, hundreds of the world’s wealthiest people converge on Venice for a bacchanal of openings, parties, and receptions that revolve around the commencement of the 57th Art Exhibition, an ostensibly not-for-profit art show that’s known colloquially as theThe Biennale comprises 85 national pavilions, 29 of which are in a leafy park called the Giardini, where countries that include the US and Russia host contemporary art exhibits. The rest of the official show is in the Arsenale, a massive warehouse complex in which one curator (this iteration was organised by Christine Mace, the chief curator of the Pompidou Centre in Paris) assembles hundreds of artworks around a theme. This year’s is Viva Arte Viva, a show “inspired by humanism”. The Biennale will run from May 13 through November 26.Satellite exhibitions will also be sponsored by philanthropies and museums, and in the case of the Punta Della Dogana, by billionaire François Pinault. (As Maramotti spoke outside, Pinault exited the building, which is currently hosting an exhibition of controversial and potentially vastly lucrative set of new works by artist Damien Hirst.)Because of the large number of global rich, not to mention the cadre of art dealers who cater to them, the Biennale has become an unofficial forum where consensus is formed about art market standouts. (On the first few days of opening festivities, people as varied as pharmaceutical heiress Maja Hoffmann, San Francisco-based philanthropist Pamela Joyner, Farah Pahlavi, the exiled empress of Iran, and UK-based magnate Poju Zabludowicz were spotted at various events throughout the city.) New artists are anointed as stars, and the status of existing art celebrities is reinforced.“It doesn’t always make careers, but it definitely can make careers,” said Heather Harmon, a director of the New York-based art advisory KCM Fine Arts, which is helping to build billionaire Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberté's collection, Lune Rouge. “Take the Anne Imhof [performance installation] at the German Pavilion. That’s going to be one of the great takeaways from this Biennial, namely that she’s one of the people who need to be paid attention to on a global level.”© Bloomberg
Household products giant Reckitt buys baby formula firm Mead Johnson for $16.6bn  [SEP]  Durex owner Reckitt Benckiser is to acquire US baby formula maker Mead Johnson for 16.6 billion US dollars. The UK household products giant, which is also behind Cillit Bang and Dettol, said it would pay 90 US dollars per share in cash for Mead Johnson. Including debt, the deal is worth 17.9 billion US dollars. Reckitt added that the deal is a "significant step" forward in its attempt to become a global leader in consumer health and the tie-up is estimated to result in Â£200 million in annual cost savings in three years. Reckitt chief executive Rakesh Kapoor said: "The acquisition of Mead Johnson is a significant step forward in Reckitt Benckiser's journey as a leader in consumer health. "With the Enfa family of brands, the world's leading franchise in infant and children's nutrition, we will provide families with vital nutritional support. This is a natural extension to RB's consumer health portfolio of Powerbrands which are already trusted by millions of mothers, reinforcing the importance of health and hygiene for their families." Under the leadership of Mr Kapoor, Reckitt has been on the hunt for a major acquisition for some time and the deal with Mead would boost its US and Asia business and help it expand its health division. Mead makes more than 70 nutritional products in over 50 markets worldwide. Based in Illinois, Mead Johnson had annual sales of 3.7 billion US dollars in 2016. The deal still requires shareholder and regulatory approval. Reckitt made the announcement alongside its full-year results, which saw operating profit rise 8% to Â£2.4 billion on revenue of Â£9.9 billion. Mr Kapoor added: "2016 was a good year in which we achieved broad-based growth and excellent margin expansion, despite challenging markets and an unusual number of issues. "In 2017, we expect macro conditions to remain challenging, and for a number of existing headwinds to persist in the first half."
Veterans arrive at Standing Rock to help protesters brace for winter  [SEP]  Wilbur Hilton, a 61-year-old veteran from Flint, Mich., helps to measure two-by-fours for barracks at one of the Oceti Sakowin Camp, a Dakota Access Pipeline protest camp, on Saturday, Dec. 3. Hilton has the help of Sean Mercer, a nonveteran protester. Hilton said the drinking water crisis in Flint motivated him to help the Sioux tribe protect Lake Oahe. CANNON BALL, N.D. — Army veteran Ryan Kiesling said he can appreciate the Standing Rock Sioux tribe’s view on the sanctity of water. After returning home from deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, other veterans suggested Kiesling try surfing to help with the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder. “That really helped me,” said the 30-year-old, who served in a cavalry division from 2007 to 2013. “I just go out there in the ocean and sit on the water, and it’s the water that really helps.” Far from the ocean, Kiesling arrived Saturday at one of the larger Dakota Access Pipeline protest camps in North Dakota to help save another body of water – Lake Oahe. Several thousand people at the camps are protesting the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline. They claim the oil pipeline, if ruptured, could contaminate drinking water in Lake Oahe, a large reservoir on the Missouri River about one-half mile from Standing Rock Indian Reservation. The protesters, who call themselves “water protectors,” have developed the mantra “water is life.” “The ocean, the water, it was my savior,” he said. “The ‘water is life’ thing, it really stuck with me. It’s something I believe in.” Veterans are gathering at points across the country to travel to Standing Rock Indian Reservation, most of them planning to arrive Sunday. They’re answering a call from organizers Michael Wood Jr. and Wesley Clark Jr. – veterans who have said former servicemembers are uniquely equipped to handle what’s become a tense and sometimes violent standoff between protesters and law enforcement. In the past two days, veterans have been arriving in the hundreds. More than 2,000 in total are expected Sunday through Wednesday. The veterans’ arrival comes at a tense time at Standing Rock. It coincides with a deadline set by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for oil pipeline protesters to leave some of the land around the construction site, and it comes just after the governor ordered protesters to evacuate. The situation has prompted response in the last few days from members of Congress and U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch. The pipeline would stretch 1,172 miles underground, moving crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois. In addition to fear of a possible pipeline leak, Sioux tribe members have also said the construction infringes on sacred grounds. Energy Transfer Partners LP applied in 2014 to build the pipeline. By March 2016, it had secured approvals from the four states in which the pipeline would pass. A group of Native Americans have been protesting since April. ‘Just trying to help' The Army Corps of Engineers ordered the thousands of protesters living at the Oceti Sakowin Camp to leave by Dec. 5. The camp is on land managed by the Army Corps near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, just north of the Standing Rock reservation. Soon after the Army Corps’ orders, North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalyrmple issued an emergency evacuation order mandating protesters leave the land. The governor and the Army Corps have said they want people out for safety reasons, especially with recent record-breaking snowfall in the area. A North Dakota Emergency Services spokesman has since said that neither law enforcement nor the National Guard would be used to enforce the order, NPR reported. Though law enforcement won’t force people out, they are trying to prevent supplies from getting to protesters, Reuters reported. The governor’s office has backed off earlier reports that a physical blockade would be established to prevent supplies from getting into the camp, but state emergency services officials told Reuters that people driving in supplies could be pulled over and fined up to $1,000. On Saturday, the temperature at the reservation topped out in the mid-20s, and some snow was hardening into ice. More snow is expected Monday, according to the National Weather Service in Bismarck. Temperatures are supposed to drop into single digits by midweek, with strong northern winds. Protesters have reiterated they will stand their ground. And they’re getting some help from the veterans. As of Saturday morning, the group, dubbed “Veterans Standing for Standing Rock,” had raised more than $1 million through a GoFundMe webpage. Some of the money will be used to help veterans travel to the site, and other money will go toward the purchase of supplies to help protesters withstand the winter. Sean Strahan, a 33-year-old Army veteran, helped haul firewood from Bismarck on Saturday morning. It was being stored under a tarp next to a tent in the heart of the camp that’s being used as headquarters for the group of veterans. “I’m just trying to help,” said Strahan, who is from Indianapolis. "People have quit their jobs and moved out here. I think we can offer them a moment of rest and reprieve.” Across the camp from Strahan, Vietnam War veteran Don Luker of Boston used a table saw to cut pressure-treated wood that would become the floor of a makeshift barracks. Luker, 66, worked as a carpenter for 40 years before retiring six weeks ago, he said. He’s planning to stay until Friday to help build some infrastructure for the protesters. Luker said he is part Cherokee. Growing up, he was instructed not to divulge that part of his heritage. “I was taught never to tell anybody,” Luker said. “Well, here we are now. Let me help my brothers and sisters. That was our job in the military, too: to try to do things that are right.” Anthony Diggs, a Marine Corps veteran from San Clemente who is acting as spokesman for the the group of veterans, said they would establish resources such as medical and supply tents, lines of communication and heating systems. The veterans’ presence at the site has drawn criticism the last few days from other veterans. On Thursday, a North Dakota veterans group sent a letter to organizers Wood and Clark, saying their involvement in the protest would reflect poorly on all veterans. The letter was written by the North Dakota Veterans Coordinating Council, which falls under the state-run Department of Veterans Affairs and comprises representatives from large veterans organizations such as the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. In the letter, the council accuses oil pipeline protesters of instigating violence, stealing from local stores and restaurants and harming or destroying private and government property. The letter mentions some specifics, including vandalism at the National World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. last month. The North Dakota column of the memorial was vandalized with spray paint. Though officials said they weren’t certain what the graffiti said, multiple news outlets reported it apparently read “#NODAPL,” a popular hashtag used by protesters on social media. “By aligning yourselves with protesters who have committed these atrocities and continue to do so, you are going to greatly diminish the good image of yourself as a veterans, veteran organizations, and veterans as a whole,” the letter reads. “You will also be aligning yourself against the N.D. law enforcement officers and military personnel that you once stood with to defend this nation.” Another group, the Midwest Alliance for Infrastructure Now, which supports the pipeline, said in a written statement that it was important to remember veterans were on the opposite side of the issue, too. The alliance's spokesman, Craig Stevens, wrote in an email that more than 60 percent of workers on the Dakota Access Pipeline are veterans, but he would not offer specifics about that number when asked. “It’s important to remember that there are veterans on both sides of this issue who have served honorably to protect Americans’ right to protest, as well as Americans’ right to work and live in a safe and harassment-free environment,” Stevens wrote in an email. “We respect the service of all veterans, yet the notion that some would descend upon Cannon Ball as self-purported ‘human shields’ is both unnerving and unnecessary.” One veteran at the Oceti Sakowin Camp – 38-year-old Douglas Concha, an Iraq War veteran – said he wasn’t too surprised at the backlash. “Whatever you do, you’re going to get criticism,” he said. “You listen to them out of respect, and maybe some of their points are valid, but don’t get caught up in it. I think it’s very natural for veterans and soldiers in general, this idea of defending something good and pure. I think the idea makes sense here.” As veterans prepare to make a stand at the site – against the cold, the pipeline and the local, state and federal government -- another fight is happening in Washington. On the House floor Wednesday, North Dakota Rep. Kevin Cramer, a Republican, read the letter from the North Dakota Veterans Coordinating Council. In an impassioned speech, he said outsiders with a “left-wing political agenda” had co-opted peaceful protests and turned them into a “full-fledged riot.” Another North Dakota lawmaker, Sen. John Hoeven, a Republican, had taken to the Senate floor Wednesday to advocate for President Barack Obama to issue an easement that would allow Energy Transfer to build past the border of Lake Oahe. The Army, the Department of Justice and Department of the Interior issued an order in September halting construction beyond the border of Lake Oahe until more environmental assessments are conducted. Energy Transfer said at the time that it had already spent $1 billion on the oil pipeline and would not re-route it. The pause in construction is unnecessary because the company had already gone through appropriate legal processes to start work, Hoeven said. “The ongoing protest activities, which at times have turned violent, are being prolonged and intensified by the Obama administration’s refusal to approve the final remaining easement at Lake Oahe,” he said. “This inaction has inflamed tensions, strained state and local resources, and, most importantly, is needlessly putting people at risk, including tribal members, protesters, law enforcement officers, construction workers and area residents.” He also called for federal law enforcement agencies to augment state and local law enforcement. On Friday, the Morton County Sheriff’s Office – the main law enforcement agency at the site – echoed Hoeven’s request. Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said in a written statement that he asked Attorney General Lynch for federal resources Friday during a phone call. “While I appreciate the Attorney General taking the time to reach out to me, neither assistance for law enforcement nor a timeline for resolution was offered,” Kirchmeier said. Lynch released her own statement Friday night. In a video, she said the Justice Department has attempted to reduce tensions and strengthen the relationship between law enforcement and tribal leaders. “Let me stress that violence is never the answer and that all of us have a responsibility to find common ground around a peaceful resolution where all voices are heard,” Lynch said. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, has been a supporter for the oil pipeline protesters and stated early on that she would join the veterans at Standing Rock this weekend. Gabbard, who is a veteran of the Hawaii Army National Guard, arrived in Bismarck on Friday night. She will be part of a news conference that the group of veterans is planning Monday morning. “This weekend I'm joining thousands of veterans from across the country at Standing Rock to stand in solidarity with our Native American brothers and sisters,” Gabbard said on the House floor Thursday. “Together we call on President Obama to immediately halt the construction of this pipeline.”
UN: India leads global decline in child marriages  [SEP]  The UN said there is a significant drop in Indian girls being forced into marriage has led a global decline in the number of child brides. — AFP picNEW DELHI, March 6 — A significant drop in Indian girls being forced into marriage has led a global decline in the number of child brides, the United Nations said today. According to UN children’s agency Unicef, 25 million child marriages have been prevented around the world in the last decade, with the sharpest drop in India and the rest of South Asia where girls as young as eight have reportedly been forced to wed. “South Asia has witnessed the largest decline in child marriage worldwide in the last 10 years... in large part due to progress in India”, it said. “In the current trend, 27 per cent of girls — nearly 1.5 million girls — get married before they turn 18 in India. This is a sharp decline from 47 per cent a decade ago.” The risk of a girl being forced to marry before the age of 18 in South Asia has decreased from nearly 50 per cent to 30 per cent, said a UNICEF statement. The agency attributed the change to better education for girls, government initiatives and strong awareness programmes. Unicef said there had also been reductions in African countries such as Ethiopia. About a third of the world’s child brides are in sub-Saharan Africa. The legal marriage age in India is 18 but millions of children are forced to tie the knot when they are younger, particularly in poor rural areas. Many parents marry off their children in the hope of improving their financial security. The results can be devastating, with girls dropping out of school to cook and clean for their husbands and suffering health problems from giving birth at a young age. In a landmark judgement last year, India’s top court said that sex with an underage wife constituted rape, in a ruling cheered by activists. UNICEF’s principal gender adviser, Anju Malhotra, warned that a lot of work remains to be done to reach the UN target of eradicating child marriages by 2030. The agency estimates that 12 million girls are forced into marriage each year, meaning that without further efforts more than 150 million will fall victim to the practice by 2030. “Each and every child marriage prevented gives another girl the chance to fulfill her potential,” Malhotra said. “But given the world has pledged to end child marriage by 2030, we’re going to have to collectively redouble efforts to prevent millions of girls from having their childhoods stolen through this devastating practice.” — AFP
Targeting U.S. automaker signals possible China retaliation over Trump talk  [SEP]  Trump's assertion that the United States need not be bound by the policy that Taiwan is part of "one China" would erode a bedrock of U.S.-China ties that has underpinned the vast increase in trade and cooperation between what are now the world's two largest economies. Few expect the disagreement will lead to outright military confrontation, nor even the kind of economic war that many feared could be launched by Trump's threat during the U.S. presidential campaign to slap tariffs of up to 45 percent on Chinese imports. However, a rising China has plenty of other ways to push back hard if Trump presses on the Taiwan question, which most analysts see as the most sensitive part of the U.S.-China relationship. In what might be a shot across the bow of the Trump administration, due to take office on Jan. 20, the official China Daily newspaper quoted a state planning official saying China will soon penalize an unnamed U.S. automaker for monopolistic behavior. While the official said no one should read "anything improper" into this, shares of General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co skidded. Auto industry sources have told Reuters this specific investigation was already underway before Trump's recent comments. However, the manner in which it was announced, by saying only that it was a U.S. automaker before a formal announcement of fines, has raised questions around whether officials might be seizing on the case to send a shot across the bow of the incoming Trump administration. Jason Miller, a spokesman for Trump, said on Wednesday Trump's team was aware of the report but it would be premature to comment. In Washington, a Democratic congressional aide said China's threat to fine the automaker was a "good sharp reminder" to Trump that "they have cards to play too and that if he is thinking that he can enter into negotiations - be it on Taiwan, trade, North Korea, whatever - as if the United States is the sole global superpower ... then he is going to need to think again." China's state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission, did not responded to Reuters requests for comment on the China Daily story. China's Foreign Ministry said it did not know any details about the case. "China welcomes foreign companies, including American ones, to invest in and operate in China. At the same time they must respect China's laws and rules. This point is very clear," ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said when asked if this was China sending a message to Trump. Pressure on other U.S. companies, such as Boeing Co ( ) and General Electric Co ( ), with large interests in China could be one of the most tangible tools of retaliation, together with new limits on access to the country's huge markets. U.S. business interests in China are estimated at more than $500 billion. Wider economic steps - such as China, America's biggest creditor, selling a significant part of its $1.16 trillion of U.S. Treasuries, or weakening its currency - seem unlikely, the first because it would slash the value of China's U.S. bond portfolio and the second because it could accelerate capital flight, experts said. Beijing could speed up a military build-up that had begun to slow along with Chinese economic growth, carry out naval exercises close to Taiwan - which it regards as a renegade province - and withhold diplomatic cooperation on issues such as Iran and North Korea's nuclear programs. "Taiwan policy is what China considers a core interest ... and it's prepared to go to great lengths to defend it," said Eric Altbach, senior vice president at the Albright Stonebridge Group consultancy in Washington and a former deputy assistant U.S. trade representative for China affairs. The consensus within the Obama administration is that Trump, who irked China by taking a phone call from Taiwan's president, was not fully aware of the potential backlash from Beijing over his questioning of the "one China" policy, a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The hope is that by the time Trump takes over from President Barack Obama, he will recognize that China has advanced so far economically, diplomatically and militarily that it is unwise to pick fights with Beijing over such a bedrock principle, he added. A former senior U.S. official took a more pessimistic view. "Trump has basically guaranteed that the first year in the China relationship will be a combative, competitive one, and the question is how bad it will get," he said. "The Chinese now are basically putting together their list on how to retaliate." There are at least three ways in which the matter could play out, U.S. China experts said. Trump could backtrack over time, much as former U.S. President George W. Bush did. A second track would be if Trump goes on questioning the "one China" policy without taking concrete action. The third, considered unlikely by U.S. officials past and present, would be a drift toward military confrontation. Asked if Trump's "one China" stance could lead to this, a source with ties to the Chinese leadership told Reuters: "We will see what Trump says and does after he becomes president." A second source with leadership ties said they expected tensions with the United States over Taiwan. But the source said Chinese President Xi Jinping, who has sounded a more nationalistic line than his recent predecessors, could also use the issue to further cement his grip on power. "If (Taiwan) is emboldened by the U.S. support and does something drastic, it could be an opportunity for us. There will be just cause to dispatch troops," the second source said. While the possibility of Taiwan declaring independence and hence triggering a Chinese invasion seems low, the mere softening in the U.S. commitment to the policy would likely play out in China's defense posture. "It will alter Chinese defense priorities. I think that’s inevitable now," said Dennis Wilder, a former CIA China analyst. He said Xi may increase Chinese military spending for 2017 and place new emphasis, over time, on gaining the amphibious capabilities necessary to actually invade Taiwan. "Xi Jinping has to respond to this internally, domestically, and while he doesn’t want an open fight with Trump, he will have to show ... resolve," he said, citing higher military spending, more defense exercises and tougher rhetoric on Taiwan. "We can anticipate that unless this issue is taken off the table."
Toys R Us might be staging comeback  [SEP]  Failed retail giant Toys R Us has set the stage for a possible comeback by canceling a bankruptcy auction, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. That auction was set to sell off intellectual properties like brand names, website domains, and the well-known Geoffrey the Giraffe mascot. But a proposed reorganizational plan would instead allow the company to relaunch a retail business using those assets, the publication reports, citing court filings. Earlier this year, the toy superstore finished the closure of its retail locations, a move that affected more than 700 stores and tens-of-thousands of jobs. At the time, Toys R Us left hints that its retail presence may return, indicating on social media that there would be "a next chapter for Geoffrey and the iconic Toys R Us brands." Court papers cited by the Journal say that there was a market for selling Toys R Us' intellectual property, but that such a sale was "not reasonably likely to yield a superior alternative" to a plan filed in September. That plan "contemplates a new, operating Toys 'R' Us and Babies 'R' Us branding company that maintains existing global license agreements and can invest in and create new, domestic, retail operating businesses under the Toys 'R' Us and Babies 'R' Us names."
Hamerton Zookeeper dies in 'freak tiger accident'  [SEP]  Image caption The zoo includes enclosures for Malaysian tigers and Bengal tigers A zookeeper has died in a "freak accident" after a tiger entered an enclosure at a wildlife park. The death happened at Hamerton Zoo Park, near Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, at about 11:15 BST. Cambridgeshire Police said: "A tiger had entered an enclosure with a keeper. Sadly the female zoo keeper died at the scene." Visitors were led away from the zoo. At no time did the animal escape from the enclosure, said police. Officers investigating the death said it "is not believed to be suspicious". Image copyright Heidi Maury Image caption An air ambulance landed at the wildlife park but there were no other injuries Hamerton Zoo Park said in a statement: "This appears to have been a freak accident. "At no point during the incident did any animals escape their enclosures and at no point was public safety affected in any way. "All our thoughts and sympathies are with our colleagues, friends and families at this dreadful time. "The park will be closed from tomorrow 30th May, and we will give more information as soon as we can." An investigation is under way, the zoo said. Image caption A new tiger enclosure opened at the zoo last summer A visitor to the zoo, who does not wish to be named, told the BBC: "We got to the zoo at opening time, around 11:45. "We were close to the tiger enclosure when a member of staff shouted for everyone to leave the park quickly and immediately." Hamerton Zoo Park The wildlife park opened in June 1990 and covers some 25 acres. It includes enclosures for Malayan tigers, Bengal tigers, cheetahs, wolves, corsac foxes, kangaroos as well as a variety of birds, reptiles and domestic animals. The zoo opened a new enclosure for its Malayan tigers in July last year. In October 2008 a cheetah which escaped from the park was found by a nine-year-old boy in the back garden of his family home. Another visitor said: "I was taking pictures of the leopards. The parrots were flying and squeaking and going berserk. "Then staff were running towards the tigers and lions area. We were all told to leave the park. But after 20 minutes everyone was allowed back in. "Staff asked us to leave again. They're not saying what happened. However, they were great. They were calm, just doing their job." Visitor Jeff Knott, 32, from Cambridgeshire, said staff had been "a real credit" to the zoo during the evacuation. "Staff were very calm and professional," he said. "All visitors around us were leaving in a very calm manner - no running, shouting or anything similar."
Keavy, West Knox firefighters battle Monday morning trailer fire  [SEP]  Keavy and West Knox firefighters spent more than two hours Monday morning battling a doublewide trailer fire off of Level Green Road. Keavy Fire Chief Richard Bales said firefighters were paged to the scene on Fields Lane about 4 a.m. “The fire was at one end of it,” Bales said when asked what firefighters were facing when they arrived on scene adding while the residence was occupied, no one was home at the time. Bales said it took firefighters about 15 minutes to knock down the flames. Because of the time of the morning, West Knox Fire Department was paged for additional manpower. “A lot of our people are going to work about then and are unable to respond,” Bales explained. Bales said while the fire started in the master bedroom, the cause is unknown. “We really don’t know,” Bales said when asked what part of the bedroom area the fire started, or whether there was anything in the room that may have sparked it. Firefighters were on the scene until approximately 6 a.m. Bales said the fire had spread through several neighboring rooms before it was brought under control. In addition, there is smoke damage throughout.
Police: 2 shot at Oklahoma restaurant; suspect dead  [SEP]  OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — A man armed with a pistol walked into an Oklahoma City restaurant at the dinner hour Thursday and opened fire, wounding two customers, before being shot dead by a handgun-carrying civilian in the parking lot, police said. The shooting happened about 6:30 p.m. at Louie’s On The Lake, a restaurant on Lake Hefner in the Oklahoma capital. A woman and a female juvenile were undergoing surgery for gunshot wounds but apparently “are going to survive,” said Capt. Bo Matthews, a police spokesman. A man suffered a broken arm while trying to escape the shooting. A family member told KOCO-TV that her daughter and 12-year-old granddaughter were shot while entering the restaurant for the girl’s birthday dinner. Authorities have not identified the injured patrons. The suspect’s identity also was not immediately known, Matthews said. The shooting appeared to be a random act. “We have no reason to believe this is a terrorist type of incident,” Matthews said. The motive was unclear otherwise, and the onsite investigation was expected to extend into the early morning hours as law enforcement personnel interview about 100 eyewitnesses, he said.
'Mother Of All Bombs' Killed 36 ISIS Fighters, Say Afghan Officials: Reports  [SEP]  The "Mother of All Bombs" dropped by the U.S. military in Afghanistan killed 36 Islamic State group members, Afghan officials said, according to media reports Friday. No civilians were hurt and several ISIS ammunition caches were destroyed in the Thursday attack, the Afghan defense ministry said. The U.S. Air Force targeted an ISIS tunnel network with the 21,000-pound MOAB, the largest nonnuclear bomb.
PLO slams US aid cuts to Palestine  [SEP]  The umbrella Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) has slammed a U.S. decision to cut more than $200 million in aid to the Palestinians. “This is flagrant declaration that the real aim of U.S. aid is to interfere in the internal affairs of other peoples and affect their national rights,” PLO Secretary-General Saeb Erekat said in a statement on Saturday. Erekat said the U.S. decision to cut aid “is a sign that [Washington] had abandoned its international obligations”. A senior State Department official said Friday that the U.S. cut more than $200 million in aid to Palestine following a review initiated by U.S. President Donald Trump. In a statement, the official said the funds originally intended for the West Bank and Gaza Strip will instead be used for "high-priority projects elsewhere." "At the direction of President Trump, we have undertaken a review of U.S. assistance to the Palestinian Authority and in the West Bank and Gaza to ensure these funds are spent in accordance with U.S. national interests and provide value to the U.S. taxpayer," he said. "As a result of that review, at the direction of the President, we will redirect more than $200 million in FY2017 Economic Support Funds originally planned for programs in the West Bank and Gaza," the official added, referring to the 2017 fiscal year. In January, the Trump administration had made drastic cuts to its contribution to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA. Trump has sparked a global anger over his decision to unilaterally recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital last December. The move undercut long-standing underpinnings of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks where the city's status was to be determined as a final-status issue. The Palestinians have snubbed calls from the Trump administration to return to the negotiating table, arguing Washington gave up its status as a neutral mediator by making the declaration. Trump and his team are preparing a rollout of their long-mulled peace plan to end the decades-long conflict.
London attacks: UK Conservative, Labour Parties suspend election campaigns after attacks  [SEP]  Great Britain’s Conservative and Labour Parties suspended its general-election campaigns Sunday hours after twin terror attacks in London left six people dead and 48 others injured. Prime Minister Theresa May said there will be no campaigning Sunday just days before the June 8 election. May did not say whether campaigning would continue before voting begins. May was expected to make a public address later in the morning. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said in a statement that campaigning would be suspended until the evening “as a mark of respect for those who have died and suffered injury.” “We will stand together to defend out common values of solidarity, humanity and justice, and will not allow terrorists to derail our democratic process,” Corbyn said. May called for a snap election in April in order to gain a bigger majority in Parliament to strengthen the country’s exit from the European Union. According to BBC, the latest polls suggest that May will still win the election. But the gap varies. Both campaigns had also been temporarily suspended in wake of the Manchester bombing two weeks ago. The Associated Press contributed to this report.
China slams N.Korea's nuclear test but unlikely to do much  [SEP]  China slams N.Korea's nuclear test but unlikely to do much BEIJING, Sept 9 (Reuters) - China criticised North Korea's nuclear test on Friday but Beijing is unlikely to follow up with strong action because its influence is limited and it believes the United States and South Korea share responsibility for growing tensions in the region. China, Pyongyang's main diplomatic ally, is key in any effort to rein in North Korea's nuclear programme. But it has been infuriated by the isolated nation's nuclear and missile tests and has signed up to increasingly tough United Nations sanctions. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China would lodge a diplomatic protest with North Korea at its embassy in Beijing for conducting the test. Beijing has also repeatedly expressed anger since the United States and South Korea decided in July to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) anti-missile system in the South to counter missile and nuclear threats from North Korea. China says this is a threat to its own security and will do nothing to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table on its nuclear programme. China's official Xinhua news agency, in a commentary after North Korea confirmed the test, said it was shocking and unwise and would only "add oil to the flames". But it added that nobody benefited from chaos or war in Korea and all parties in the international community should exercise restraint and avoid doing anything that is "mutually irritating". "Not long along, South Korea ignored the strong opposition of neighbouring countries and decided to deploy the THAAD system, which is diametrically opposed to efforts to maintain peace and stability on the peninsula, has seriously damaged regional strategic balance and caused a rise in tensions on the peninsula." Previous recent comments from China following North Korean missile tests, including one on Monday when China was hosting the G20 summit, have pointedly not mentioned North Korea by name. One senior Beijing-based Western official, who has worked in Pyongyang, said China had little influence and no control over North Korea, despite the popular perception in Washington. "The North Koreans don't like the Chinese and certainly don't listen to them," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. It's also a misunderstanding to think that the North's youthful leader Kim Jong Un is unhinged, he added. "The North Korean leadership knows exactly what they are doing and how far they can push things. They know it would be the end of their country if they really provoked a war as the Americans would just flatten them." Michael Madden, an expert on the North Korean leadership, said he was fairly confident that North Korea would have given Russia and China advance warning of the test. Choe Son Hui, North Korea's negotiator for the stalled talks on Pyongyang's nuclear programme, visited Beijing this week, while Yun Tong Hyon, the vice chief of the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces, led a North Korean military delegation to Moscow this week. "Both would have direct knowledge about a forthcoming test and would be tasked to pass along a heavily implicit message," said Madden. Hua, the Chinese spokeswoman, said she had no information to provide on whether Beijing got advance warning. Another Beijing-based diplomatic source said the level of Beijing's anger with South Korea could be seen with what he termed as the unusually strong public comments about THAAD by President Xi Jinping when he met South Korea's president this week on the sidelines of the G20 summit. "Mishandling the issue is not conducive to strategic stability in the region and could intensify disputes," Xi was quoted by China's Foreign Ministry as saying. The diplomatic source said it was not expected that China would publicise such comments. "China blames South Korea and the United States just as much as it does North Korea for the current state of tensions," the source said. To be sure, there is little public sympathy in China for Kim, who is derisively referred to on Chinese social media as "Fatty Kim the Third" after his father and grandfather. On Friday, China's Twitter-like Weibo service blocked searches for that term, although there were still plenty of comments condemning him. "Fatty the Third has gone crazy," wrote one user. China is also upset with the United States for what it sees as Washington's interference in the disputed South China Sea. Jin Qiangyi, Director of Yanbian University's Centre for North and South Korea Studies on the Chinese side of the North Korea border, said China would be in a quandary about a substantive reaction. "We can't completely not cooperate with the United States, but we can't completely be at their beck and call," Jin said, pointing to the South China Sea as an issue that China is unhappy with the United States about. Still, China's options are limited for a country already under tough sanctions which in any case does little trade with the outside world. "If North Korea does not listen, of course we can try pressure, to use sanctions to resolve things," Jin said. "But if that does not work what then? Is there anything else we can do? The answer is no."
Obama to meet Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi  [SEP]  Coming only days after Obama departed Asia for the final time as president, the visit also underscores the administration's driving foreign policy pivot toward the continent, an approach that's come with mixed success. In his meeting with Suu Kyi, Obama hopes to ascertain whether the time is right to remove further economic sanctions on leaders in Myanmar, which he hopes could spur greater economic development in the country. In November, when Suu Kyi was elected to her post, the US removed certain government-run businesses and some banks from a blacklist in an attempt to jump-start trade. A latest round of sanctions relief could ease restrictions on Myanmar's military, which ran the country for decades and still controls important government functions like its borders and armed forces. It's not clear whether Suu Kyi would support such sanctions relief, however, given the military's still-outsized role in governing her country. The US is also looking to end restrictions on imports of jade and other precious gems, which could prove a boon to Myanmar's fledgling economy.
NHL not going to 2018 Olympics  [SEP]  For the first time since 1994, NHL players will not attend the Winter Olympics. The league released a statement Monday saying it “considers the matter officially closed” and that it won’t participate in the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Negotiations between the league, the NHL Players’ Association and the International Olympic Committee have stalled in recent months. In the statement, the NHL said it was open to hearing from the parties involved but that “no meaningful dialogue has materialized.” “Instead, the IOC has now expressed the position that the NHL’s participation in Beijing in 2022 is conditioned on our participation in South Korea in 2018,” the league said. “And the NHLPA has now publicly confirmed that it has no interest or intention of engaging in any discussion that might make Olympic participation more attractive to the clubs.” The league said it will now proceed with finalizing the schedule for next season. The NHL Players’ Association didn’t immediately respond to the league’s announcement. The NHL had been at every Winter Olympics since 1998 and players have expressed their desire to continue participating. It was just over a year ago at the Stanley Cup final in Pittsburgh that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman began pouring cold water on the idea of NHLers participating in 2018. In particular, Bettman was miffed that the International Olympic Committee was resisting payment on out-of-pocket costs for NHL players to attend — a subsidy that had been covered over the previous five Games. Bettman said the cost was “many, many, many millions of dollars” and doubted that owners would pay for the “privilege of disrupting our season”. Little had changed by early winter. Bettman continued to fume about money as well as the IOC’s unwillingness to let the NHL be associated with the Olympics in any fashion. The league couldn’t air highlights or promote their presence at the Games. “It doesn’t give you the warm and fuzzies,” Bettman said at the PrimeTime Sports Management Conference. A decision, he added, would likely be required by early January at the latest. The NHL league then proposed an idea to the NHLPA that would extend the current collective bargaining agreement as a part of package for players to attend in 2018. The union turned down the deal. “So hopefully we’ll still be able to conclude an agreement to go to the Olympics,” executive director Donald Fehr said at the time. “We still think it’s important and we’ll go from there.” But by early December, at the board of governors meetings in Florida, Bettman hinted at “fatigue” from the owners at going to the Games again. There were concerns, he said, about shutting down the season, what with the impact of a compressed schedule on players. The group also wasn’t convinced that there was any tangible benefit to the NHL being in South Korea. The Games had shown some impact when played in North America, but little beyond its shores. “I think our constituents have become increasingly negative toward the Olympic experience,” deputy commissioner Bill Daly said. A few weeks later, Daly said the league had begun crafting two potential schedules for the 2017-18 season — one that included the NHL going to the Olympics and one that didn’t. A month after that, at all-star weekend in Los Angeles, Bettman said a conversation among the board of governors as it pertained to the Olympics lasted all of 10 seconds. Nothing had changed from December when the views were strongly negative. Daly explained that the NHL was still waiting for some sort of game-changer to sway the owners, but didn’t know what that game-changer would be. “All I can tell you is if we’re going to hear the same thing I don’t think it’s going to move the ball,” Daly said. Players expressed hope that wouldn’t be the case. Connor McDavid said “100 per cent” that NHL players should go. The Edmonton Oilers captain, who wasn’t even born the last time NHL players didn’t attend in 1994, said he couldn’t envision the Olympics without the world’s top players. “I just feel like we’re misrepresenting our sport on a pretty huge scale and a pretty huge level,” Jonathan Toews, a long-time ace for Team Canada, added. “A lot of the talk has been it’s the players pushing for it, and it’s the players that are interested and want to go. I think the players do want to go, but I think it should be of interest to the players and the league. I think the NHL should be in the Olympics.” The NHL, NHLPA, IOC and International Ice Hockey Federation all gathered for a hopeful meeting in early February, but by early March, Bettman said there was again nothing new to report. The owners were still unconvinced by the merits of players getting their wish to go to the Games. Shortly thereafter Fehr hinted that players might be able to attend the Games whether the NHL gave the OK or not. He said the PA thought it was “very probably an individual club decision”, an avenue that might conceivably allow those like Alex Ovechkin to come to agreements on attending with their respective teams. “The NHL knows what our position is,” Fehr said late last month. “They know we think it’s important. They know that we believe very strongly that players ought to have an opportunity to play. They know we think it’s in the long-run good for the game. And it’s something that we ought to try and do.”
Protests as police detain Catalan officials in referendum crisis  [SEP]  Pro-secession protesters in Barcelona hold a symbolic ballot box in front of Catalonia's economic department on Wednesday, as police detained several Catalan officials ahead of a planned independence vote (AFP Photo/LLUIS GENE) Barcelona (AFP) - Spanish police detained 13 Catalan government officials Wednesday as they crack down on preparations for an independence referendum in the region which Madrid says is illegal, sparking angry protests in Barcelona. The police raids came amid mounting tensions as Catalan leaders press ahead with preparations for the October 1 vote despite Madrid's ban and a court ruling deeming it unconstitutional. Among those arrested by Spain's Guardia Civil police force was Josep Maria Jove, secretary general of economic affairs and the deputy of Catalonia's vice president Oriol Junqueras, a regional government spokesman said. The others work in various Catalan government departments, including its economic and budget affairs departments, a local Guardia Civil spokesman said. The reasons for the arrests were not immediately clear, but Spain's central government has warned that officials who help stage the referendum could face criminal charges. Police said they were carrying out a total of 22 searches as part of the operation. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside near Jove's office in central Barcelona, chanting "Independence" and "We will vote". Many were drapped in red and yellow Catalan flags. Anna Sola, an unemployed 45-year-old, said she rushed to Jove's office after hearing of his arrest on the news and through text messages from friends. "They are attacking our institutions, those that we voted for, just for simply doing what the people want, and without any respect," she said. "It is shameful what is happening in Catalonia, there are no words for it." The police operation comes a day after officers seized a trove of documents related to the independence referendum from the offices of Unipost, a private delivery company, in Terrassa, a city near Barcelona. Police said they confiscated over 45,000 notifications which were about to be sent to Catalans selected to staff polling stations for the vote, representing 80 percent of the numbers necessary to ensure the stations were adequately staffed. Police scuffled with dozens of pro-secession protesters who gathered outside the Unipost office to try to keep officers from entering the building. The protesters placed flowers on police vehicles and sat on the street to block access to the site. Madrid has taken several other steps to prevent the Catalan referendum from going forward, including threatening to arrest mayors who facilitate the vote, seizing posters and fliers that promote the plebiscite and tightening control over the region's finances. It says the country's constitution stipulates that a Spanish region does not have the right to call a referendum. Tensions have also spilled over to Spain's parliament in Madrid, where Gabriel Rufian, a lawmaker for the pro-separatist Catalan Republican Left (ERC), on Wednesday told Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to take his "dirty hands off Catalan institutions". "The will of the Catalan people cannot be stopped. And now we will leave to support our friends," he added before he and his fellow ERC lawmakers stormed out of the assembly. Rajoy defended his government's actions, saying that it was "fulfilling its obligation". "The rule of law works," he said. Spain's Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis has accused Catalan separatists of using "Nazi" tactics to intimidate their opponents before the referendum. "Referendums are a weapon of choice of dictators," he added during an interview broadcast Tuesday with Bloomberg television in New York. Pro-separatist parties captured 47.6 percent of the vote in a September 2015 regional election in Catalonia which was billed as a proxy vote on independence, giving them a narrow majority of 72 seats in the 135-seat Catalan parliament. But opinion polls show that Catalonia's roughly 7.5 million residents are deeply divided on independence. A survey commissioned by the regional government in July showed that 49.4 percent of Catalans were against independence while 41.1 percent were in favour. But more than 70 percent of Catalans said they wanted a referendum on independence to settle the issue. Catalonia, a wealthy region which accounts for about one-fifth of Spain's economic output, already has significant powers over matters such as education and healthcare. But Spain's economic worries, coupled with a perception that Catalonia pays more in taxes than it receives in investments and transfers from Madrid, have helped push the cause of secession.
Kelly: Garcia’s Masters victory the ultimate act of redemption  [SEP]  After he’d beaten Sergio Garcia in a playoff at the 2007 British Open, Padraig Harrington paused to do emotional triage on the bereft Spaniard. “I know this sound clichéd, but, at 27, he’s still young and he will win majors. It will happen,” the Irishman said. It didn’t help. Garcia was already slipping into despondency: “I don’t know how I manage to do these things.” In the intervening decade, the rest of us came over to Garcia’s point of view. Once the most heralded young golfer in the world, he had become the sport’s middle-aged punch line. He may not have been born a loser, but he’d worked up to it. It wasn’t a function of talent. Rather, it was the paucity of practising exorcists left in the world. Because clearly, Garcia was cursed. As he edged into his 30s, Garcia’s smile disappeared. His posture bowed. He became blurry around the edges. Looking back on his most famous teenage highlight – skipping up the fairway after a mind-boggling escape shot at Medinah – you felt as though you were looking at completely different person. Now 37 years old, unrealized expectations had quite literally crushed Garcia. So on Sunday, as we watched him win his first major at the Masters, it was more than a highlights package, a garish jacket and a big cheque. It was an opportunity to watch in real time as someone redeemed a lifetime’s effort after 20 years of failure. “It’s funny. I have seen it several times,” Garcia said afterward on the topic of how he’d anticipated this moment. “When I came here in ’99 as an amateur, I felt like this course would give me at least one championship. … I’m not going to lie. That thought changed in the years. But I kinda came to peace with it … I think because of that, I’m able to stand here today.” Too often, the final day of the Masters descends into a re-enactment of Tortoise v. Hare. All the juice is sucked out of the occasion as someone runs away with it in the last five or six holes. Then it turns pompous and processional. This time, it was instead an electric back-and-forth between the final pair – Garcia and England’s Justin Rose. At one point, Garcia was up by three shots. Then came the expected, slow collapse. On the 13th, it looked as though the Spaniard had blown it, driving his ball into thick brush and taking a penalty drop. He recovered. From that point, the rest of the field conveniently dropped away, which allowed the two Europeans to engage in match play of unparalleled quality. There were, in all, two or three shots from either man that will be replayed here for many years. The afternoon ended in an 18-hole draw. Rose shanked his first shot of the playoff and was forced to punch out from the underbrush. He knew he’d lost it then. Instead of walking up to the green with Garcia, he lingered on the fairway, conceding the moment and the ovation to his long-suffering colleague. Golf likes to talk up its image as a gentleman’s game, and sometimes fails in that respect. But Rose’s gesture showed the sport at its most noble. “You can’t feel bad for me,” Rose said wryly afterward, sounding like he actually meant it. Few men will understand Garcia’s difficulties quite so well as Rose. He also peaked early – finishing fourth as a 17-year-old at an Open. He also fell into a performance trough, missing the cut in his first 21 professional outings. He was also prematurely written off. And it took finally winning a major in his 30s to shut everyone up. This must be why he could be so sanguine while watching another man take a prize he’d had one hand on. Justin Rose understands the power of fate. As it ended, Garcia didn’t leap about. After a few fist pumps, he dropped into a winded crouch and stayed there for a few beats. He looked like he wanted to cry, but could not locate the proper emotion. A function of face-saving, major-tournament habit, perhaps. Hours before, as Rose and Garcia were beginning their shift, Canadian Adam Hadwin had just finished his own. “At least we have something positive to talk about today,” the Augusta debutant said as he shuffled up to the mics. He finished his tournament at six over par. “It is just another event at the end of the day,” Hadwin said, channelling his internal sports psychologist. Tell that to Garcia. Or Rose. Or any one of the thousands who were there at the end. It’s very difficult to properly convey to someone who hasn’t been here exactly how unlike any other place Augusta National is, how disorienting it can feel in snapshots. There is an attendant in the bathroom whose job it is to freshen the stalls between uses. He stands against the back wall, spray bottle at the ready, and waits. Among the people leading small tour groups around the media centre is former U.S. national security adviser Condoleezza Rice. A while back, she advised a president of the United States. Now she’s shuffling rich swells around an oversized living room. You may drink yourself legless, but you may never, ever, lie down on the grass (according to rumour, because a spectator once fell down dead during the Masters and, embarrassingly, no one noticed). This place is – and I use the word advisedly – surreal. And it seems that way to those of us who are only visiting. Imagine how much more bizarre it must feel to those few who perform in the show’s final act. There is undoubtedly a strong element of the ridiculous to Augusta National. Everything about it is so heightened, so exaggerated, that it borders on cartoonish. What makes it a dreamland instead of a theme park is that, every year, all the people who come here get to watch someone else’s lifetime dream come true. Some years – like this year – the dream is just a little bigger.
Military jet crashes outside Joint Base Andrews in Maryland  [SEP]  An F-16C fighter jet crashed Wednesday morning in a wooded area near Joint Base Andrews in Prince George’s County, Maryland, authorities said. The single-engine aircraft, assigned to the 113th Wing of the D.C. Air National Guard, crashed about 9:15 a.m. just six miles south of the base. Officials at the base said the jet was flying with other Guard planes on a routine training mission. The aircraft carried only one pilot, who ejected safely and sustained non-life threatening injuries, Andrews officials said. “It’s very fortunate,” Prince George’s County Fire Chief Ben Barksdale told reporters Wednesday afternoon. “With a very heavily, densely populated area … for the pilot to be able to eject and not be injured, and for the plane to go down in a wooded area.” Chief Barksdale said there was “trouble with the aircraft” before the crash, but he did not elaborate. Fire department spokesman Mark Brady said the plane came down between two neighborhoods, about 200 yards from homes, in the area of Temple Hill Road and Woodells Court in Clinton. The crash ignited a small fire, which was quickly extinguished. Fire officials were unable to confirm the cause of the plane crash, but they said there was no damage to nearby buildings and no one on the ground was injured. People who live in the immediate area were evacuated to Clinton Grove Elementary School. Evacuees have been cleared to return to their homes. The school did not close. Joint Base Andrews officials scheduled an afternoon press conference at the base. Mr. Brady had been posting on social media photos and videos of the crash site. He later posted on Twitter: “At the request of Military Police on location at crash site I will be deleting any video and pictures posted on Social Media of crash area.” In a tweet, the fire department spokesman advised residents who find anything they believe to be a part of the aircraft not touch or move it. They should call Joint Base Andrews at 240-857-8685. The 113th Wing of the D.C. Air National Guard protects the nation capital’s airspace and deploys on global missions. Known as the Fighting Falcon, the F-16 is the Air Force’s supersonic fighter that was first approved for production in 1976.
The Latest: Ex-rebels want to meet with new Colombia leader  [SEP]  The Latest: Ex-rebels want to meet with new Colombia leader BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — The latest on Colombia's presidential election (all times local): Demobilized members of Colombia's once biggest rebel group say they want to meet with President-elect Ivan Duque to discuss implementation of the nation's peace accord. Ex-guerrilla leader Rodrigo Londono congratulated Duque for his victory in Sunday's presidential runoff election and said Colombians should work together because "the road of hope is open." In his victory speech, Duque said earlier that he doesn't want to "shred the accord to pieces" but also promised to make changes to ensure victims get justice. Many Colombians oppose generous terms for high-ranking guerrillas involved in atrocities, such as allowing them to enter politics and escape any jail time. The former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia is now a political party. Londono himself ran for president but withdrew his bid amid health complications. Colombian President-elect Ivan Duque says he wants to build consensus and unite the country following a polarizing campaign that laid bare deep divisions over a peace deal with leftist rebels. In his victory speech, Duque hit on the same law and order themes that propelled him to victory in Sunday's runoff election over former leftist rebel Gustavo Petro. Duque promised to modify the 2016 peace accord with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia without breaking it, putting the victims of rebel violence at the center of any change. He also vowed to attack corruption and to address a surge in cocaine production that he said threatens Colombia's national security. He provided few details on how he will bring about reconciliation other than saying he will work tirelessly on behalf of all Colombians. The losing candidate in Colombia's presidential runoff election is challenging winner Ivan Duque to break with his hawkish conservative allies and uphold the peace accord with leftist rebels. Otherwise, leftist Gustavo Petro says, Duque will face stiff resistance from the historic number of voters who sided with Petro's candidacy. In a long concession speech, Petro said Sunday evening that he doesn't feel defeated. He declared himself an opponent to Duque's future government, drawing wild shouts of "resistance" from supporters who gathered to hear the same fiery rhetoric that filled plazas during the polarizing campaign. Petro is making clear he is no mood to heal divisions. He says that if Duque doesn't cuts ties with allies like former President Alvaro Uribe, he will face a fight with a newly energized left. Leftist candidate Gustavo Petro is taking his loss in Colombia's presidential runoff in stride, even as his supporters seem dejected for failing to make the race more competitive. Petro went on Twitter to highlight the more than 8 million votes he received Sunday, which Is more than any leftist candidate has gotten before in one of Latin America's most conservative nations. He tweets: "There's no defeat here." His supporters gathered at his campaign headquarters, some of them in tears consoling each other as they waited for Petro to deliver his concession speech. Petro lost to conservative Ivan Duque by more than 12 points. Under Colombia's new election law, Petro as the runner-up will be given a seat in the Senate from which he is expected to lead the opposition to a Duque government. Official results in Colombia's presidential runoff vote show electoral authorities understated the turnout. When polls closed Sunday, National Registrar Juan Carlos Galindo said just 44 percent of registered voters had cast ballots. That would have been one of the lowest participation rates for Colombians in recent memory. But with returns in from more than 99 percent of polling stations, the reported turnout is 53 percent — just below the level in the first round of voting three weeks ago and the highest in a Colombian presidential runoff since 1998. Colombia election results show Ivan Duque, the young conservative protege of a powerful former president, is poised to become the country's next president. Duque holds a 12-point lead over leftist contender Gustavo Petro with nearly 97 percent of voting centers reporting in a preliminary count. The 41-year-old Duque would take charge of the South American nation from outgoing President Juan Manuel Santos as it implements a still fragile peace accord after more than five decades of armed conflict. Duque soared in the polls as he promised to roll back parts of the historic accord with leftist rebels but not "shred it to pieces." Duque gained his front-runner status thanks in large part to support from Alvaro Uribe, the former president who is both widely admired and detested in Colombia. Colombians who support conservative presidential candidate Ivan Duque have begun celebrating even before final results are announced in the country's presidential runoff election. Duque admirers honked car horns and began congregating Sunday around the site in Bogota where he is expected to receive the final results. A preliminary count of nearly 85 percent of voting center reports indicates Duque has a lead of 13 percentage points over his leftist runoff opponent, Gustavo Petro. Duque is promising to roll back parts of a contentious peace accord with leftist rebels for ending Latin America's longest running conflict. Early results in Colombia's presidential race indicate conservative Ivan Duque is well ahead. An initial count of 22 percent of polling stations reporting shows Duque leading by 18 percentage points over former leftist guerrilla-turned-politico Gustavo Petro in the race to succeed President Juan Manuel Santos. Duque is the protege of influential former President Alvaro Uribe and would become the nation's youngest president in over a century. He is promising changes the nation's historic peace accord with leftist rebels. Turnout in Colombia's presidential runoff fell by almost 10 percentage points from the first round of voting three weeks ago. National Registrar Juan Carlos Galindo said after polls closed Sunday that just over 44 percent of registered voters cast ballots. It is one of the lowest turnouts in a Colombian presidential runoff in memory. Four years ago, almost 48 percent of registered voters cast ballots in electing President Juan Manuel Santos. Some said there was a packed schedule of World Cup games involving Brazil, Mexico and Germany that kept many soccer-crazed voters at home glued to their TV sets. Other people may have stayed home out of disgust with the polarized nature of the campaign between the two ideological finalists — conservative Ivan Duque and former leftist rebel Gustavo Petro, Polls have closed in Colombia's presidential runoff election as the nation implements a historic peace deal with leftist rebels. Some voters ran to polling sites in Bogota to cast ballots before the closure on a day when many people were also trying to fit in World Cup matches. Young conservative Ivan Duque and former rebel-turned-politico Gustavo Petro are vying to lead the South American nation. Whoever wins will inherit a country where coca production is soaring and a fragile peace deal to end five decades of conflict remains contentious. Both candidates have vowed to uproot endemic corruption and improve Colombia's economy but have presented diverging views on how to do so. They also differ on how to proceed with implementing the peace accord. Crowds of supporters have cheered both of Colombia's presidential contenders as they cast their ballots in a crucial runoff race. Conservative front-runner Ivan Duque said he wants to unite the country and turn a page on corruption. The 41-year-old also said his victory would allow Colombia to be governed by a new generation. Backers of his rival, ex-Bogota mayor Gustavo Petro, chanted "President Petro!" and reached out to shake his hand as he made his way to vote through a tight crowd of admirers Sunday. Petro said he believes Colombians want change and that he would win by a considerable margin. The hopes and fears among Colombians voting in the nation's first presidential election since the signing of a peace accord with rebels are palpable at the ballot box. Thirty-eight-year-old businesswoman Katherine Cuellar said Sunday she is voting for conservative candidate Ivan Duque because she believes leftist rival Gustavo Petro is "a very dangerous person who will do the country much harm." Engineer Luis Alberto Castroe said a vote for Duque would mean "little change" for Colombia, and he cast his ballot for Petro instead. Other voters like Adriana Suarez were filing blank ballots, believing neither candidate is a viable option during a critical juncture in Colombia's history. Powerful former President Alvaro Uribe is making a strong last-minute warning against leftist candidate Gustavo Petro, who is facing Uribe protege Ivan Duque in Colombia's presidential runoff. Uribe said while casting his vote Sunday that Duque is the best guarantee against Colombia falling victim to "destructive socialism" in the mold of the country's crisis-wracked neighbor, Venezuela. Petro led a groundbreaking campaign a decade ago to expose criminal ties between Uribe's allies and far-right paramilitary groups. Uribe said the conservative Duque and his running mate Marta Lucia Ramirez "are the guarantee that will scatter the dangers of social and democratic instability that hang over our fatherland." Polls have opened for Colombia's presidential election, where voters are choosing between a young conservative lawmaker and a former leftist guerrilla as the nation implements a historic peace accord. Colombians began gathering outside polling centers early Sunday to cast their ballots in a tense runoff between Ivan Duque and Gustavo Petro. The vote comes at a crucial moment: A still-fragile peace deal with leftist rebels is being implementing and coca production is soaring. The two candidates have presented starkly different views on Colombia's economic model and whether changes should be made to the peace accord.
Dozens injured in 6.0 quake in western Iran: media  [SEP]  Tehran: Dozens have been injured in a strong 6.0-magnitude earthquake that struck western Iran near the border with Iraq early Sunday, local media reported. The shallow quake hit 26 kilometres (16 miles) southwest of the city of Javanrud in Kermanshah province, the US Geological Survey said, near the site of a powerful quake last year that killed hundreds. A local medical university said a 70-year-old man had died of a heart attack in the town of Novosbad, according to the Tasnim news agency. It said a total of 58 people had been reported injured across several towns. A government official in Salas Babajani told state news agency IRNA that at least seven people were injured there, and that relief forces were on alert. Local journalists said a crisis centre had been set up in Javanrud to coordinate emergency operations. Images on social media showed people being rushed to hospitals, but suggested relatively light damage to infrastructure. Iran sits on top of two major tectonic plates and sees frequent seismic activity. In November last year a major 7.3-magnitude quake killed 620 people in Kermanshah province and another eight people in Iraq.
Explosion at Japan restaurant injures 42  [SEP]  Fires broke out following the incident in the northern city of Sapporo, Kyodo news agency said, and images from the scene showed large flames and plumes of smoke rising in the night air. SAPPORO: An explosion at a restaurant in northern Japan injured 42 people late Sunday (Dec 16), police said, with the blast reportedly causing surrounding buildings to collapse. Fires broke out following the incident in the northern city of Sapporo, Kyodo news agency said, and images from the scene showed large flames and plumes of smoke rising in the night air. A police official for the Hokkaido region told AFP "there are 42 injuries" but no one was killed. Kyodo said one person was in critical condition. They are still investigating the cause which "would take some time". Kyodo said eyewitnesses reported smelling gas in the area following the explosion. National broadcaster NHK said the flames were extinguished several hours after the fire broke out, with police and fire department officers still at the site. Earlier police warned of secondary explosions, according to Kyodo, which described buildings collapsing following the incident around 8.30pm (1130 GMT). A man who lived nearby told the Japanese news outlet that he heard a loud “bang” which sounded like thunder and felt his condominium shake. Other witnesses shared photos and videos of the incident on Twitter, showing the burning building and thick black smoke.
Bradford Bulls to be allowed to compete despite liquidation  [SEP]  Bradford will be allowed to continue in the 2017 Kingstone Press Championship despite going into liquidation, the Rugby Football League has announced. The Bulls officially ceased trading on Tuesday and the club's players were told they are now free agents after the administrators failed to find a new buyer. However, the four-time Super League champions will be given the go-ahead to compete in the Championship, which kicks off in a month's time, under new owners, albeit with a 12-point deduction as punishment for breaching the game's insolvency regulations. A statement the RFL said: "While a number of alternatives were considered the board were most mindful of the planning already undertaken by all other clubs in the competition structure, the season tickets already purchased and the players and staff who will now be seeking employment in and around the sport in 2017. "Accordingly the board has agreed that the wider interests of the sport is best satisfied if it offers a place in the Kingstone Press Championship to any new club in Bradford and that such a club start the 2017 season on minus 12 points."
US slaps new Iran sanctions over ballistic missiles, terrorism  [SEP]  The United States announced new sanctions against Iran Tuesday over its ballistic missile program and what it called Tehran's support for terrorist groups in the Middle East. The sanctions announced by the State Department target 18 individuals or entities described as supporting Iran's ballistic missile program or the elite Republican Guard. The announcement came a day after the United States certified that Iran was complying with the landmark nuclear deal signed two years ago with the United States and other world powers, but also warned it was preparing new sanctions. "The United States remains deeply concerned about Iran's malign activities across the Middle East which undermine regional stability, security, and prosperity," State Department said. It cited Iran's support for Hezbollah, Hamas, the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Huthi rebels in Yemen fighting a US-backed coalition led by Saudi Arabia.
Dozens killed in Kazakhstan bus crash  [SEP]  MOSCOW — Emergency officials in Kazakhstan say 52 people have died when a bus carrying them caught fire. The Emergencies Ministry of the former Soviet nation in Central Asia said Thursday’s tragedy happened in the northern Aktobe region. The ministry said that only five of 57 people in the bus have managed to get out and survived the fire. The ministry said they are being treated for injuries. The ministry said that some of the victims were citizens of neighboring Uzbekistan.
German court bails Puigdemont in extradition hearing  [SEP]  A German court on Thursday refused Spain's request to extradite Catalan ex-leader Carles Puigdemont on a rebellion charge following his arrest in Germany last month, ordering his release on bail pending a hearing on a lesser charge. In a heavy blow for Madrid, judges at the upper state court in Schleswig-Holstein "believe that in regard to the allegation of rebellion, extradition is illegal" as Puigdemont was not personally involved in violence during a referendum on Catalan independence last October. That made his actions not punishable under German law, the judges said in a statement, rejecting prosecutors' argument that the Spanish "rebellion" charge was similar enough to Germany's "high treason" statute to justify an extradition. The Catalan separatist figurehead could still be extradited on a charge of misusing public funds, the judges added, although "further facts must be clarified and information gathered" in the coming days and weeks. But meanwhile Puigdemont can leave custody if he fulfils court-imposed conditions including a payment of 75,000 euros ($92,000). Regional newspaper Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung reported that the politician would also have to report to the police every week and would not be allowed to leave Germany without prosecutors' consent. A spokesman at the Neumuenster prison where Puigdemont has been held since March 25 said he would not be released before Friday morning. "See you tomorrow. Thank you very much to everybody!" read a tweet posted from Puigdemont's account late Thursday. Puigdemont's German defence team welcomed the court's decision to set aside the "outrageous" charge of rebellion in a statement. They "respected" judges' decision to ask for more information from Spain on the misuse of funds charge in a "case with trend-setting signficance for the European understanding of democracy," they added. "[Puigdemont] always said that he had full confidence in the German judiciary," his Barcelona-based lawyer Jaime Alonso-Cuevillas tweeted. A Spanish government source told AFP that Madrid "always respects" judicial decisions "whether they please it or not". "The government is sure that Spain's justice system will take the appropriate measures given these new circumstances, to ensure respect for the laws of our country," the source added. If extradited only on the charge of misusing public funds, Puigdemont cannot be prosecuted in Spain on the more serious charge of rebellion. There is no such offence on German law books, although prosecutors had argued that it could be seen as roughly equivalent to the crime of "high treason". The misuse of public funds charge relates to the cost of the Catalan independence referendum, estimated at 1.6 million euros by Madrid. News of Puigdemont's bail "will reduce tension and pressure in Catalonia" where protestors have blocked streets and clashed with police in recent days, political scientist Oriol Bartomeus of the Autonomous University of Barcelona told AFP. But the relief would only be "momentary", he added, noting that "nothing has been resolved" by Thursday's decision. Puigdemont's lawyers have appealed in Spain against the "rebellion" charge, highlighting that he was not involved in violence. Public opinion in Spain is divided on whether the referendum constituted a "violent uprising" as described in the law. Catalans mostly reject the rebellion charges, according to opinion polls, with a major demonstration calling for imprisoned separatist leaders to be freed planned for April 15 in Barcelona. After being removed from office by the central government in Madrid following a unilateral declaration of independence on October 27, Puigdemont fled to Belgium. He was arrested in northern Germany in late March on the way back from a trip to Finland. Puigdemont and six political allies escaped Spanish authorities in an attempt to "internationalise" their plight by dragging other European Union countries into the row. Nine other pro-independence figures are currently in custody, including six members of Puigdemont's Catalan government and the former president of the Catalan parliament.
Chief: Officer Killed In South Carolina Was 'Bravest Police Officer I've Ever Known'  [SEP]  FLORENCE, S.C. (CBSDFW.COM/AP) — A 30-year police veteran was killed and six of his fellow officers were wounded when a man opened fire from inside his home on deputies who came to serve a search warrant, authorities said. The shooting continued for hours as the man barricaded himself inside with children, firing from a distance at officers who came to help. Authorities had to use a bullet-proof vehicle Wednesday to recover the wounded, and the shooter finally released the children as he was taken into custody, authorities said. “Officers went there unknowing the firepower the suspect had,” Florence County Sheriff Kenney Boone said at a news conference. “Fire was being shot all over. The way this suspect was positioned, his view of fire was several hundred yards. So he had an advantage. The officers couldn’t get to the ones who were down.” The violence stunned people already dealing with record flooding from Hurricane Florence. Both the sheriff and police chief both cried as they spoke to reporters after the standoff. The slain officer, Terrence Carraway, 52, of Darlington, had just been honored for his 30 years of service with the Florence Police Department. “I want you to pray for the family who lost the bravest police officer I have ever known,” said his chief, Allen Heidler. The suspect opened fire on three Florence County deputies who had come to serve a search warrant around 4 p.m. Wednesday, Boone said. Then, he shot four Florence city police officers, one fatally, as officers from all over swarmed in to help, Heidler said. Boone credited his department’s military equipment for enabling them to pull the wounded from the field of fire. “Thanks to our MRAP, armored personnel carrier, we made sure all the officers that were shot were protected and brought for medical attention,” he said. Officials refused to say why they were serving a warrant. They did not name the suspect. They also did not identify the wounded officers or describe their conditions. Condolences and outpourings of support rolled in. President Donald Trump tweeted his “thoughts and prayers,” saying “We are forever grateful for what our Law Enforcement Officers do 24/7/365.” “This is simply devastating news from Florence,” Gov. Henry McMaster tweeted. “The selfless acts of bravery from the men and women in law enforcement is real, just like the power of prayer is real.” Thom Berry, spokesman for the State Law Enforcement Division, said the agency had sent crime scene technicians to assist officials in Florence but at this time had not been requested to help with any investigation. Boone said investigators from Richland County would help. He did not say why he wasn’t using state police like most law enforcement agencies do in officer shootings in South Carolina. Authorities said the shootings happened in Vintage Place, an upscale neighborhood in the western part of the city. Bobby Goin stood outside waiting for police to let him back to his home, where his wife and granddaughter could hear the gunshots. “Surprised is probably an understatement,” said Goin, who has lived in the neighborhood for 20 years. “The worst thing that goes on around here is that someone runs a stop sign and it gets posted on Facebook.” This is the second shooting of multiple police officers in South Carolina this year. In January, a 47-year-old former banker shot four officers in York County, killing one, after his wife called 911 to report he beat her. Christian McCall pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life without parole. Florence, a city in South Carolina’s northeastern corner home to roughly 37,000, sits at the convergence of Interstates 95 and 20. It’s the largest city in the region known as the Pee Dee, where flooding from Hurricane Florence devastated areas to the east and south.
Taiwan's former president gets 4-mth jail term over information leak  [SEP]  TAIPEI, May 15 (Reuters) - A court in Taiwan on Tuesday sentenced former president Ma Ying-jeou to four months jail over a leak of information related to national security, legal documents showed, but he vowed to appeal, and could avoid jail altogether by paying a fine. In the first conviction in a series of lawsuits against Ma since he left office in 2016, Taiwan's High Court overturned a lower court's judgement of not guilty. "Ma Ying-jeou violated the Communication and Surveillance Act," it said in its judgment, adding that the punishment for the sections infringed was four months' imprisonment. The court found that Ma had leaked information related to national security, and an opposition lawmaker Ker Chien-ming, that should have been confidential. Ma's sentence could, however, be avoided on payment of a fine of T$120,000 ($4,019), the court said in a statement, in line with Taiwan law that allows such payments for lighter sentences, instead of going to jail. "This case is a type of constitutional lawsuit," he said. "What I´m fighting for is not just my own rights, but it´s also related to how the authority of Taiwan´s future presidents should not be limited." He added, "Therefore I definitely need to clarify this problem, I definitely will appeal." A former stalwart of the opposition Nationalist or Kuomintang Party, Ma was Taiwan's president from 2008 to 2016, ushering in an era of closer ties with mainland China. China considers self-ruled and democratic Taiwan to be a wayward province to be taken back by force one day, if necessary. Beijing has taken an increasingly hostile stance over the past two years towards Taiwan, following the election of Tsai Ing-wen of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party to succeed Ma.

Pacers steal game one from Cavs, Harden leads Rockets  [SEP]  The Cavaliers fell hard against the Indiana Pacers in Cleveland on Sunday. LeBron James and the Cavaliers lost 98-80 in game one to the Pacers after Indiana outscored them 33-14 in the first quarter. Victor Oladipo led the Pacers with 32 points, six rebounds and four assists. After draining just six of 25 from three-point range last postseason with the Thunder, Oladipo made six of nine from deep. James recorded a triple-double for the Cavs, scoring 24 points with 12 assists and 10 rebounds, but no one else in the starting lineup scored over nine points (Kevin Love and Rodney Hood). Instead, Cleveland's secondary source of points came from J.R. Smith's 15 off the bench. The Cavaliers cut Indiana's lead to just eight points entering the fourth quarter, but the Pacers started the game with more fire, and ended it that way too, outscoring the Cavs 25-15 in the fourth quarter. Myles Turner helped spark Indiana's elite defensive effort by scoring 16 points with eight rebounds and a block. The Pacers forced 16 Cavs turnovers, and held Cleveland to just 38.5 shooting from the field. The NBA playoffs rarely get upsets in the first round, but the Pacers downing the three-time defending East champions would certainly raise some eyebrows. Meanwhile, James Harden scored 44 points on 15-of-26 shooting with eight assists to help the Rockets escape game one with a 104-101 win over the Timberwolves. Harden’s 44 points were one shy of tying his playoff career-high and five points shy of tying the Rockets' all-time record. Houston center Clint Capela led the way early, finishing the game with 24 points and 12 rebounds. The Rockets were outscored in the third and fourth quarters, but still managed to sneak out a win. Paul George and Russell Westbrook led the Thunder to a 116-108 game-one win over the Jazz. George scored 36 points with seven rebounds, while Westbrook flirted with a triple-double, scoring 29 points with 13 rebounds and eight assists. The Celtics featured five players with at least 19 points in their 113-107 overtime game-one win over the Bucks. Al Horford led the way with 24 points and 12 rebounds. Terry Rozier added 23 points, Marcus Morris had 21 from off the bench, Jaylen Brown scored 20 points, and Jayson Tatum added 19 points and 10 rebounds. With Kyrie Irving and Marcus Smart out of the lineup, Boston need to maintain a balanced scoring attack to contend. Bucks guard Eric Bledsoe was given a golden opportunity this season, moving from the Suns to Milwaukee, but the mercurial guard did not take advantage of his playoff opportunity, scoring just nine points on four-of-12 shooting. He also turned the ball over five times and had just four assists. Golden State, missing Stephen Curry, looked far better off than the Spurs, who are still without Kawhi Leonard. The Warriors' depth and star power should help them overcome Curry's absence in this series, but the defending champions will need their star point guard by the time Houston come calling. San Antonio need LaMarcus Aldridge to play out of his mind in order to draw this series out at all.
3,300-Year-Old “Mummy Cheese” Found in Saqqara - Archaeology Magazine  [SEP]  CAIRO, EGYPT—Researchers from Cairo University and the University of Catania claim they have found a hunk of the world’s oldest solid cheese in a broken jar in a tomb in Saqqara, Egypt, according to a Live Science report. The tomb belonged to Ptahmes, a government official who was in charge of the ancient city of Memphis and served during the reigns of Seti I and Ramesses II. The cheese—a powdery, whitish mass discovered in one of the jar fragments—is thought to have been covered with a scrap of canvas that was found nearby. Chemical analysis of the substance detected five proteins commonly found in milk from cows, sheep, goats, and buffalo. Two of those proteins only come from cows. The researchers think the “cheese-like product” was made from a mixture of cow’s milk and the milk of either sheep or goats. The scientists also identified a protein associated with Brucella melitensis, a bacterium that causes the disease brucellosis, which is characterized by fever, nausea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal symptoms.

Iranian oil tanker burns, 32 missing after collision off China’s coast  [SEP]  BEIJING: A tanker carrying Iranian oil and run by the country’s top oil shipping operator was ablaze and spewing cargo into the East China Sea on Sunday after colliding with a Chinese bulk ship, leaving its 32 crew members missing, the Chinese government said. Thick clouds of dark smoke could be seen billowing out of the Sanchi tanker <C}KS7309492494>, engulfing the vessel as rescue efforts were hampered by bad weather and fire on and around the ship, Mohammad Rastad, head of Iran’s Ports and Maritime Organisation, told Iranian television. The Sanchi collided with the CF Crystal <C}BO7309522955> about 160 nautical miles off the coast near Shanghai on Saturday evening, the Chinese Ministry of Transportation said in a statement. The Panama-registered tanker was sailing from Iran to South Korea, carrying 136,000 tonnes of condensate, an ultra light crude. That is equivalent to just under 1 million barrels, worth about $60 million, based on global crude oil prices. “Sanchi is floating and burning as of now,” the ministry said. “There is an oil slick and we are pushing forward with rescue efforts.” State media CCTV showed pictures of the tanker ablaze and billowing plumes of thick dark smoke. It had sent four rescue ships and three cleaning boats to the site by 9 a.m. (0100 GMT) on Sunday, it added. South Korea also sent a ship and helicopter to help. A Korean Coast Guard official confirmed the tanker was still raging at 1 p.m. (0500 GMT). He declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media. The tanker’s 32 crew members were all Iranian nationals except for two Bangladeshi nationals, the Chinese transport ministry said. “There is a wide perimeter of flames around the vessel because of the spillage and search and rescue efforts are being carried out with difficulty,” Rastad said. “Unfortunately, up to this moment, there is no news of the crew,” he said. CF Crystal’s 21 crew members, all Chinese nationals, were rescued and the ship suffered “non-critical” damage, China’s transport ministry said. The incident marked the first major maritime incident involving an Iranian tanker since the lifting of international sanctions on Iran in January 2016. There was a collision involving an NITC-operated supertanker in the Singapore Strait in August 2016, but there was no loss of life or pollution. The Chinese government gave no details of the size of the spill. The Foreign Ministry said in a separate statement that the cause of the incident was under investigation. Reuters ship tracking data shows Sanchi was built in 2008 and was managed by the National Iranian Tanker Co (NITC). Its registered owner is Bright Shipping Ltd. It was due to arrive at Daesan in South Korea from Kharg Island in Iran on Sunday, according to Reuters ship tracking. The Sanchi tanker, leased by Hanwha Total Petrochemical Co Ltd [SMCHE.UL], had “valid foreign insurance”, Iranian oil ministry spokesman Kasra Nouri told Iran’s state television. Hanwha Total was not immediately available for comment. Sanchi collided with CF Crystal, registered in Hong Kong, which was carrying 64,000 tonnes of grain from the United States to China’s southern province of Guangdong, the government said. CF Crystal, which was built in 2011, was due to arrive in China on Jan. 10, according to Reuters ship tracking data.—Reuters
Four Americans Killed as Plane Crashes Into Australian Mall  [SEP]  Four Americans were among five people killed when a light plane crashed into the roof of a shopping mall in Melbourne, Australia, the State Department has confirmed. According to NBC News, the twin-turboprop Beechcraft King Air plane suffered engine failure and crashed into the mall near the end of the runway at Essendon Airport around 5 p.m. ET Monday (9:00 a.m. Tuesday local time), according to authorities. Witnesses described the plane exploding on impact and erupting into a fireball. The assistant police commissioner for Victoria state said there were no fatalities other than those five people on board the aircraft. "We extend our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of all those who died in today's tragic crash," a State Department official told NBC News. "The U.S. Embassy and Consulate in Melbourne are working closely with local authorities. We stand ready to provide all appropriate consular assistance to the families of the victims," the official added without identifying the victims.
Brazil's far-right candidate falls short of election stunner  [SEP]  SAO PAULO (AP) — A far-right former army captain who expresses nostalgia for Brazil's military dictatorship won the first round of its presidential election by a surprisingly large margin Sunday but fell just short of getting enough votes to avoid a runoff against a leftist rival. Jair Bolsonaro, whose last-minute surge almost gave him an electoral stunner, had 46 percent compared to 29 percent for former Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad, according to figures from Brazil's Superior Electoral Tribunal with 99.9 percent of the vote counted. He needed over 50 percent support to win outright. Polls predicted Bolsonaro would come out in front on Sunday, but he far outperformed expectations, blazing past competitors with more financing, institutional backing of parties and free air time on television. Despite the sizable victory, polls have shown the two candidates are neck-and-neck for the Oct. 28 runoff, and much could shift in the coming weeks. Two other candidates, one center-left and one center-right, said they would decide in the coming days if they would endorse anyone. Ultimately, Bolsonaro's strong showing reflects a yearning for the past as much as a sign of the future. The candidate from the tiny Social and Liberal Party made savvy use of Twitter and Facebook to spread his message that only he could end the corruption, crime and economic malaise that has seized Brazil in recent years — and bring back the good old days and traditional values. "This is a victory for honest people, who want the best for Brazil," said Bianca Santos, 40-year-old psychologist, who added Bolsonaro would end high crime rates. Brazil is the largest economy in Latin America and it is a diplomatic heavyweight in the region. Bolsonaro has promised to shake up its foreign policy, including taking a harder line on Venezuela and other leftist regimes and forging closer ties with the United States. He won over many foreign investors by promising smaller government and a more open economy. But the election largely turned on domestic matters, on which Bolsonaro has alienated nearly as many people as he has attracted. Many fear what Brazil will look like if he wins. Barbara Aires, a transgender woman who unsuccessfully ran for Rio de Janeiro state representative, said Bolsonaro's first-round victory represented a "step backward" that could lead to "taking back rights and more violence toward the LGBT community." The two candidates have painted starkly different visions of the country's past and future. Bolsonaro has portrayed a nation in collapse, where drug traffickers and politicians steal with equal impunity, and moral rot has set in. He has advocated loosening gun ownership laws so individuals can fight off criminals, giving police a freer hand to use force and restoring "traditional" Brazilian values — though some take issue with his definition of those values in light of his approving allusions to the 1964-1985 dictatorship and his derisive comments about women, blacks and gay people. He once told a fellow congresswoman that she was too ugly for him to rape and said that he would not be able to love a gay son. While those comments have disgusted many, Bolsonaro has capitalized on Brazilians' deep anger with their traditional political class and "throw the bums out" rage after a massive corruption investigation revealed staggering levels of graft. Beginning in 2014, prosecutors alleged that Brazil's government was run like a cartel for years, with billions of dollars in public contracts handed out in exchange for kickbacks and bribes. Revelations of suitcases of cash, leaked recordings of incriminating exchanges between powerbrokers and the jailing of some of the of the country's most powerful people, including da Silva, unfolded like a Hollywood script — and then became one: Netflix released a (barely) fictionalized account of the probe this year. The Workers' Party was at the center of that investigation, and many have turned to Bolsonaro as a tactic to keep the party out of office. "I voted against thievery and corruption," said Mariana Prado, a 54-year-old human resources expert. "I know that everyone promises to end these two things, but I feel Bolsonaro is the only one can help end my anxieties." Meanwhile, the party has struggled to stage a comeback with Haddad after da Silva was barred from running. He has said that many of the allegations against Workers' Party politicians are political persecution and portrayed a country hijacked by an elite that will protect its privileges at all costs and can't bear to see the lives of poor and working class Brazilians improve. Haddad has promised to roll back President Michel Temer's economic reforms that he says eroded workers' rights, increase investment in social programs and bring back the boom years Brazil experienced under his mentor, da Silva. Bolsonaro's poll numbers jumped after he was stabbed during a campaign event on Sept. 6. He was unable to campaign or participate in debates as he underwent surgeries during a three-week hospital stay, but instead brought messages directly to voters via Facebook and Twitter. "For a front-runner, the best thing to do is commit as few errors as possible," said Andre Portela from Getulio Vargas Foundation, a leading university and think tank. "Getting stabbed helped Bolsonaro in that. He wasn't exposed to debate, to people questioning him." The campaign to run Latin America's largest economy, which is a major trade partner for countries in the region, has been unpredictable and tense. Da Silva led initial polls by a wide margin, but was banned from running after a corruption conviction. Bolsonaro's stabbing forced candidates, and Bolsonaro himself, to shift strategies and recalibrate. All along, Brazilians have said their faith in leaders and their hopes for the future are waning. This election was seen as the great hope for ending a turbulent era in which many politicians and business executives were jailed on corruption charges, a president was impeached and removed from office in controversial proceedings, and the region's largest economy suffered a protracted recession. Instead, the two front-runners merely reflect the rabid divisions that have opened up in Brazilian politics following former President Dilma Rousseff's impeachment and the revelations emerging from the "Car Wash" graft probe. Caught in the middle are Brazilians who dislike both candidates and see them as symbols of a broken system. "I think we're going to continue with the same polarization," if either Haddad or Bolsonaro wins, said Victor Aversa, a 27-year-old massage therapist who voted for center-left candidate Ciro Gomes, who had been polling third. "We've been on this path of crazy bipolarity. Haddad and Bolsonaro will both lead populist governments." Prengaman reported from Rio de Janeiro.

Separatists launch 'autumn of protests' on Catalonia Day  [SEP]  BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of Catalan separatists let out a collective shout as they marched along a main artery in Barcelona on Tuesday, marking the first of a series of mass mobilizations demanding independence from Spain and the release of several high-profile secessionists from jail. With the official slogan "Let's Make the Catalan Republic" printed on pink T-shirts and signs, protesters went silent at 5.14 p.m., which on a 24-hour clock is 1714 — the year when Barcelona fell in the Spanish War of Succession. A loud cheer and cries of "independence" and "freedom" followed, sweeping along a six-kilometer (3.7-mile) -long stretch of the city's Diagonal avenue. In a giant symbolic wall, protesters toppled the image of a king of spades playing card, in an apparent rejection of the Spanish monarchy. Barcelona's local police estimated around 1 million protesters took part. Grassroots organizers said that 470,000 people had signed up online for the rally, with many more expected to join in. The march on the traditional Sept. 11 holiday in Catalonia called "la Diada" has drawn similarly huge crowds of secession supporters in recent past years. This year's demonstration comes nearly one year after an illegal referendum on secession held by Catalan authorities led to an ineffective independence declaration that received no international recognition. Catalan separatist leaders and activists who pushed it, defying Spain's constitutional protection of territorial integrity, are either in prison awaiting trial or have fled the country. Quim Torra, Catalonia's regional president, said Tuesday that while maintaining his pledge to see through the breakaway bid, his immediate focus is on putting pressure on the courts ahead of the trials of the separatist movement's jailed leaders. Torra's goal is to stoke public showings of strength on Oct. 1, the anniversary of the referendum that was met by a police crackdown, the failed declaration of independence last Oct. 27, and the imminent start of the trials. "In the coming weeks we are going to put all out efforts into denouncing" the situation of the jailed separatists, Torra said. "If the prisoners are not absolved, my government and the Catalan Parliament will take necessary action." Some within the secessionist movement want Torra's government to immediately try again to unilaterally break with Spain. "We have come here today to demand once again freedom for Catalonia," said 57-year-old Lourdes Casajus, who came from her home in Vic, a town in the Catalan heartland, to join the separatist rally. "Last Oct. 1, we voted in a referendum and the majority for independence wasn't respected. This Sept. 11 we demand that all the politicians, both from there and ours here, respect the people's will." Torra, who came to power after secessionist parties won a regional election, has met with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and is planning a second meeting, in what is considered a thawing of relations between Madrid and Barcelona. Torra wants Spain's new center-left national government to agree to a binding independence referendum, while Sanchez will only offer a vote on increasing northeastern Catalonia's already considerable degree of self-rule. Catalonia's separatist political parties, which hold seats in Spain's Parliament, have failed to garner support to amend the Spanish Constitution to allow a vote on secession. Sanchez issued an appeal to "start a dialogue between Catalans" on Tuesday. Polls and official election results indicate that roughly half of Catalonia's 7.5 million residents are against severing century-old ties with the rest of Spain. Catalans have family in other parts of Spain, share in its cultural traditions and speak Spanish along with Catalan. Non-separatists often say they no longer feel welcome at "la Diada," which they say has ceased to be a celebration of Catalan identity and become a political rally. "I have attended almost all of Catalonia Day celebrations," 51-year-old Victor Pozanco said. "But five years ago I stopped attending. I don't want to be counted as another separatist simply by attending the rally. Because I am not one of them, but I am Catalan." There are also those who feel that the tensions that have arisen because of the secession question are taking an ugly toll on families and friendships. "I am in the middle," 53-year-old cafe owner Nelida Adell said. "I have more affinities with the separatists but I also have family ties in the rest of Spain. So I don't want a radical break. I would like tensions to decrease. I fear things could get out of hand." Hernan Munoz in Barcelona and Aritz Parra in Madrid contributed to this report.
Moon orders 'overwhelming' show of military force against North  [SEP]  South Korean President Moon Jae In ordered the military to demonstrate an "overwhelming" show of force against North Korea's latest missile provocation yesterday, amid rising calls at home for him to harden his stance against the North. Hours after Pyongyang fired a missile that flew over Japan yesterday, South Korea sent four F-15 fighter jets out in a live-bombing drill in the eastern city of Taebaek at 9.20am local time. Officials said the exercise shows that the South can wipe out the North Korean leadership in the event of an attack by the North. Rare footage of the South's testing of a 500km-range ballistic missile with improved warhead power, and another with a range of 800km, was released yesterday by the Agency for Defence Development. These are core parts of South Korea's Kill Chain pre-emptive strike system, capable of striking "any place in North Korea if necessary", it said. Seoul also issued a strong warning to Pyongyang, vowing a firm response if provocations continue. Mr Moon, a liberal leader elected in May, has pushed for dialogue with the North even as he has sought to exert pressure on the regime to end its nuclear programme and return to the negotiating table. But he has come under growing pressure to be tougher on Pyongyang, and has been accused of downplaying the North's previous provocations, including three failed missiles last Saturday in protest against US-South Korea military drills that end tomorrow. On Monday, Mr Moon ordered military reforms to enhance the country's defence capability, saying that South Korea must be able to swiftly adopt an offensive stance if the North attacks it. South Korean Defence Minister Song Young Moo is set to meet his American counterpart James Mattis in Washington this week to discuss countermeasures against the North's growing missile threats. But analysts said that Mr Moon is unlikely to deviate much from his long-term goal of improving ties with the North. At a ceremony yesterday to appoint the new vice-chairman of the National Unification Advisory Council, the South Korean leader reiterated his goal. "We must work harder to bring about change in inter-Korea relations," he was cited as saying in a presidential statement. Unification Minister Cho Myoung Gyon said yesterday at a forum that South Korea will persist in diplomatic efforts to peacefully resolve the North's nuclear issue, while sternly responding to its provocations at the same time. Opposition parties, however, continued to urge Mr Moon to give up his dreams of reconciliation. The main opposition, the conservative Liberty Korea Party, asked him to re-calibrate his North Korea policy and not hang on to the "illusion" that Pyongyang would end its nuclear programme if talks resume. The minor Bareun Party also called on the Moon administration to stop being "preoccupied" with its so-called Berlin initiative to seek talks with the North, and take steps to boost the country's missile defence against Pyongyang's threats. Dr Go Myong Hyun of The Asan Institute for Policy Studies told The Straits Times that Mr Moon gave a strong response yesterday for two reasons - to ease domestic pressure and remind North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that he would reach a dead end if he continues to launch provocations. "With (yesterday's) strong response, the South Korean government sends a message that South Korea is going to match North Korea's escalations," he said. "It shows... this government is not a friendly government to North Korea."
Northern Irish Women Will Get Free Abortions On NHS In Face Of Tory Rebellion  [SEP]  Northern Irish women will have abortions carried out in England on the NHS funded by the UK government, ministers have confirmed in the face of a major Tory backbench rebellion. MPs were due to vote this evening on an amendment to the Queen’s Speech, tabled by Labour MP Stella Creasy, to improve abortion access. As a result many Northern Irish women travel to England to have abortions on the NHS - but currently have to pay. The government has been under pressure over abortion rights after it struck a deal with the socially conservative DUP. Creasy’s amendment called on the government to ensure that “all UK citizens including those from Northern Ireland may access medical services including abortion procedures in England if they so wish without charge”. She told HuffPost UK earlier today that up to 40 Tory rebels were prepared to vote in favour of her amendment raising the prospect of Theresa May’s first Commons defeat since she became prime minister. The announcement that the current policy would be changed was first made by Philip Hammond in the Commons. “At present women from Northern Ireland are asked fora payment and from now on it is our proposal that this will no longer happen. This is clearly a sensitive issue and one which has direct implications for equality and treatment of women from Northern Ireland,” she said. As spokesperson for the British Pregnancy Advisory Service charity said: “We are absolutely delighted that the government has committed to funding abortion care for women who travel from Northern Ireland to England. “This is a landmark moment: for years the women of Northern Ireland, despite being UK citizens and taxpayers, have not been entitled to NHS-funded treatment. “Clearly this is not the solution to the gross injustice whereby women in Northern Ireland are denied access to abortion care at home, and we look forward to seeing progress on that front. Nevertheless this is an important moment, and we commend all those who have worked so hard to make this happen.” But the support the Conservative Party has secured from the DUP’s 10 MPs following a £1bn deal described by critics as a “bung” mean it should clear the Commons.
North Carolina voting law falls as Supreme Court turns down GOP appeal  [SEP]  In a victory for voting rights advocates, the Supreme Court has turned down an appeal from North Carolina’s Republican leaders and let stand a decision that struck down their 2013 law that added new restrictions on voting. The 4th Circuit Court had branded the law as racially biased and said North Carolina lawmakers had targeted black voters “with almost surgical precision.” North Carolina lawmakers took action immediately after the Supreme Court by a 5-4 vote had voided part of the historic Voting Rights Act that required some states, including North Carolina, to get federal approval before altering their voting laws. The new North Carolina measure made five changes, including restricting early voting, which had been used more often by African American voters, and by requiring registered voters to show one of several photo ID cards at the polls. The appeals court noted the state had chosen the types of photo IDs that were less likely to be held by African Americans. Then Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican, slammed the decision and lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court. Last year, four of the high court’s conservative justices had signaled they were prepared to block the lower court ruling and revive the law. They then lacked a fifth vote due to the vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. But the situation changed in November when the state’s voters ousted McCrory and narrowly elected Democrat Roy Cooper. And he and the state’s attorney general, also a Democrat, recently told the high court they did not wish to appeal the lower court’s ruling. At the same time, , the GOP-controlled legislature said it did wish to have the appeal heard. After considering the issue for several weeks, the Supreme Court announced Monday it would not hear the case. “Given the blizzard of filings over who is and who is not authorized to seek review in this court under North Carolina law, it is important to recall our frequent admonition that the ‘denial of a writ of certiorari imports no expression of opinion upon the merits of the case,’” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said. The court’s action sets no legal precedent, but it likely ends the litigation over the North Carolina law. Voting rights advocates hailed the demise of the North Carolina law. “An ugly chapter in voter suppression is finally closing,” said Dale Ho, director of the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project. “We are grateful that the Supreme Court has decided to allow the 4th Circuit’s ruling to stand, confirming that discrimination has no place in our democracy and elections,” said Allison Riggs, senior staff attorney with the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. “This ruling sends a strong message that lawmakers in North Carolina should stop enacting laws that discriminate based on race.” Trump orders voter fraud commission after lodging charges over the 2016 election that he won U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments on Trump’s revised travel ban Senate approval of Trump's trade chief could speed up NAFTA talks
Supreme Court leaves door open to curbing partisan districts  [SEP]  WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Monday allowed electoral maps that were challenged as excessively partisan to remain in place for now, declining to rule on the bigger issue of whether to put limits on redistricting for political gain. The court issued a pair of unanimous rulings in partisan redistricting cases from Wisconsin and Maryland that decided very little, and ensured that any resolution by the nation's high court would not come before the 2018 midterm elections. Proceedings in both cases will continue in lower courts. Meanwhile, the justices could decide by the end of June whether to take up a new case from North Carolina. Still, the outcome was a setback for advocates of limits on what is known as partisan gerrymandering because they hoped they had finally found a way to prove their case to a long-skeptical Supreme Court and Justice Anthony Kennedy, in particular. There were two cases on the court's agenda, one brought by Democrats and the other, by Republicans. The justices had a range of options before them, including a broad, statewide look at the issue in Wisconsin, where Republicans have a huge edge in the legislature in a state that is otherwise closely divided between the parties. A three-judge court in Wisconsin had struck down the map as unconstitutional. In Maryland, Republicans sued over a single congressional district that was redrawn in 2011, as the state's Democratic former governor said, to turn a Republican seat Democratic. The Maryland case is only in its preliminary phase and has not yet had a trial. That will now happen. Rather than endorse limits or rule them out altogether, the court decided each case on procedural grounds. In Wisconsin, the court said that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that they have the right to sue on a statewide basis, rather than challenge individual districts. The majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts in the Wisconsin case cast doubt on the broadest theory about the redistricting issue known as partisan gerrymandering. Roberts wrote that the Supreme Court's role "is to vindicate the individual rights of the people appearing before it," not generalized partisan preferences. The usual course when the justices find that parties to a lawsuit lack the right to sue, or standing, is to dismiss the case. But, Roberts wrote, "This is not the usual case." So the voters who sued will be able to try to prove they have standing. "This is definitely not the end of the road," said Sachin Chheda, director of the Fair Elections Project which organized and brought the lawsuit. "There is no vindication for the state's rigging of the maps and disenfranchising of our voters here," Chheda said. "We know as well today as we did when we started that our democracy is threatened and we need to return the power to the people." Republicans hold a 64-35 majority in the Wisconsin Assembly and an 18-15 majority in the Senate. Wisconsin's Republican legislative leaders, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, issued a joint statement in reaction saying they were pleased with the decision and were confident they would ultimately win. "Democrats have been using the maps as an excuse for their failure to connect with Wisconsin voters," Vos and Fitzgerald said. "We believe the redistricting process we undertook seven years ago fulfilled our constitutional duty, and followed all applicable laws and standards that are required in redistricting." The unanimous outcome was unexpected because the justices appeared deeply divided about how to handle partisan districting cases. The outcome still only partially masked disagreement on the issue. Justice Elena Kagan wrote a separate opinion for her three liberal colleagues that suggested how the plaintiffs might solve the problem of standing going forward. They also called on the court to decide the issue once and for all. "But of one thing we may unfortunately be sure. Courts_and in particular this court_will again be called on to redress extreme partisan gerrymanders. I am hopeful we will then step up to our responsibility to vindicate the Constitution against a contrary law," Kagan wrote. On the other side, Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch wrote that they would have ended the lawsuit and not given the Wisconsin voters another chance to make their case. Kennedy, who had been viewed as the deciding vote on partisan redistricting, did not write separately Monday. In 2004, he wrote that he was not closing the door on limits on partisan gerrymandering, but that he had yet to find a workable way for courts to police the practice. The next chance to weigh in is a case from North Carolina that seemingly addresses some of the high court's concerns. A lawsuit filed by North Carolina Democrats has plaintiffs in each of the state's 13 congressional districts. Like Wisconsin, North Carolina is generally closely divided in politics, but Republicans hold a 10-3 edge in congressional seats. Associated Press writer Scott Bauer contributed to this report from Madison, Wisconsin.
How Clinton dodged questions about Monica Lewinsky sex scandal  [SEP]  Former president Bill Clinton could have avoided impeachment if he had just settled the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against him out of court sooner, those involved in the case have revealed. 'The blue dress would have never been discovered, the lawsuit would have been dropped,' former Jones advisor, Susan Carpenter says on Sunday's sixth episode of Fox News' Scandalous series. She adds: 'The Clintons have won many battles, but they lose major wars, and this was one of them.' 'It depends upon what the meaning of the word 'is' is. If 'is' means is and never has been, that is not—that is one thing. If it means there is none, that was a completely true statement,' Clinton said with what seems like a smirk on his face while trying to defend a false affidavit Clinton's January 1998 deposition, in which he infamously denied having sexual relations with White House intern Monica Lewinsky, effectively gave special counsel Kenn Starr the perjury and obstruction of justice cases he needed for congress to begin looking into the president's misconduct. The Jones lawsuit, where the former Arkansas state employee claimed the then-governor propositioned her, was eventually settled out of court for $850,000, but the damage had already been done. Starr began his misconduct investigation focusing on alleged abuses surrounded the Whitewater investigation, the firing of White House travel agents, and the alleged misuse of FBI files. But it was the Lewinsky revelation as he looked into the Jones case that gave Starr a case against Clinton. Former U.S. attorney, Joseph DiGenova added: 'The complete strategy by [Clinton's] legal team to stretch this out and to use the publicity for their own aggrandizement was a terrible mistake. They hurt the president, they made him go through a deposition in essence forcing him to commit a crime.' Months after lying under oath, Clinton would become the first sitting U.S. president to testify as the subject of a grand jury investigation. During his grand jury testimony, Clinton questioned the exact meaning of the word 'is' in an attempt to defend a false affidavit in which Lewinsky claimed 'there is no sex of any kind, in any manner, shape or form with president Clinton'. When asked by former Deputy Independent Counsel Sol Wisenberg, to confirm the affidavit was 'utterly false', the former president gets into semantics. 'It depends upon what the meaning of the word 'is' is. If 'is' means is and never has been, that is not—that is one thing. If it means there is none, that was a completely true statement,' Clinton said with what seems like a smirk on his face. Wisenberg said: 'I guess because the president was not having sex with Ms Lewinsky at the moment that the question was asked by Paula Jones' attorneys, then it was technically true.' Of course, as the world now knows, the president would later admit to the country during a televised address to the affair with Lewinsky, calling it 'wrong'. By the end of 1998, Clinton became the second president ever to be impeached before being acquitted by a Senate impeachment trial on February 1999. Former Minority Counsel to the House Judiciary Committee, Julian Epstein said: 'You realize that what is happening is incredibly important and incredibly historic, and kind of a once in a lifetime thing. It does not mean that any of us enjoyed it, but we knew it was important, and we knew it was important to be handled well.' The penultimate episode of Scandalous airs Sunday, February 25 at 8pm on Fox News.
Mollie Tibbetts' suspected killer was a 'hardworking all American boy'  [SEP]  The man accused of killing college student Mollie Tibbetts has been described as a 'hard working, all-American boy' by his defence solicitor. Cristhian Bahena Rivera, 24, has been charged with first-degree murder after allegedly leading police in Iowa, US, to Mollie's body hidden under corn stalks. The University of Iowa psychology student was last seen out jogging in Brooklyn, Iowa, on the night of July 18. After over a month of searching for the 20-year-old, a body was found in a rural farm field in Poweshiek County on Tuesday. Undocumented immigrant Rivera lived in the same tiny Iowa town as Mollie and home to around 1,500 people. For the last four years, he worked at Yarrabee Farms, where he reportedly gave his employers fake identity documents under a different name. Since he was arrested far-right commentators, including President Trump, have seized on the case as an argument for tougher border controls and to attack other illegal immigrants. Yesterday, Rivera made his first appearance at the Poweshiek County Courthouse wearing a black and white striped prison jumpsuit. His lawyer Allan Richards argued for a fair trial for Rivera who has endured character attacks by far-right media. He told the court attacks on Rivera were "political payback". Richards later told People magazine Rivera had “no prior criminal record.” He added: “He was just a part of the community. An all-American boy working really hard. “He lived alone and worked 12 hours [a] day, seven days a week. He was handling the milk supply. He is a loving father." Rivera's girlfriend and young child attended the hearing. When asked if he had anything to say Rivera answered "no" through an interpreter. Bond for Rivera was set at $5 million. In a statement released to the press Mollie's family said: "Our hearts are broken. "On behalf of Mollie's entire family, we thank all of those from around the world who have sent their thoughts and prayers for our girl. "We know that many of you will join us as we continue to carry Mollie in our hearts forever. "At this time, our family asks that we be allowed the time to process our devastating loss and share our grief in private. "Again, thank you for the outpouring of love and support that has been shared in Mollie's name. We remain forever grateful." Authorities said yesterday that Rivera admitted pursuing the 20-year-old jogger in his car on July 18, before parking, getting out of the vehicle and running after her. He reportedly told investigators that the student grabbed her phone and threatened to call cops as he ran alongside her - and he then "panicked". The suspect apparently told investigators he "came to" at an intersection, before realising he had put the jogger in his car boot and opening it up. He found the University of Iowa student inside the boot with blood on the side of her head, according to the document, written by a sheriff's deputy. He then allegedly dragged her out of the vehicle, into a cornfield, before carrying her deeper into the field over his shoulder and putting her down. There, he covered her with corn stalks, the document adds.

Muenster attacker was lone German with mental health problems -...  [SEP]  MUENSTER, Germany (Reuters) - The man who drove a camper van into a group of people sitting outside a restaurant in the German city of Muenster on Saturday acted alone and appears to have had mental health problems, the regional interior minister said on Sunday. The man killed two people when he ploughed the vehicle into people seated at tables outside the Grosser Kiepenkerl eatery, a popular destination for tourists in the old town of the university city in western Germany. He then shot himself dead. “We now know it was in all likelihood a lone perpetrator, a German,” Herbert Reul, interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, home to Muenster, told reporters. “There are lots of indications the person in focus had (psychological) abnormalities. This must be carefully investigated,” he said after paying his respects to the victims with national Interior Minister Horst Seehofer and state premier Armin Laschet. There was no evidence of any link to Islamist militancy and the suspect was not a refugee, Reul said. The senior public prosecutor in Muenster, Elke Adomeit, said the perpetrator, who German media named as Jens R., was known to police for making threats, damaging property, a hit-and-run traffic accident, and fraud. “All proceedings (against him) were discontinued,” Adomeit said. Muenster police chief Hans-Joachim Kuhlisch said investigators had searched four apartments overnight belonging to the man, who was 48. “You will understand that with four apartments - two in eastern Germany, two in Muenster - we can’t now say conclusively that we won’t find anything,” he said. However, investigators found no signs of a political motive in their initial searches of the apartments and of several cars and a container belonging to the man, Kuhlisch said. In Berlin in December 2016, a Tunisian whose request for asylum was turned down and who had links to Islamist militants hijacked a truck and ploughed into a crowded marketplace. Twelve people, including the man driving the truck when it was hijacked, were killed. Police said on Sunday they were still investigating possible motives and forensic investigators were scouring the scene of the attack for clues. Seehofer described the attack as a “cowardly and brutal crime”. He, Laschet and Reul laid flowers in central Muenster and paid their respects to the victims of the attack. “We have again experienced that ... absolute security is unfortunately not possible,” Seehofer said, adding that the government would do everything possible to protect citizens. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported in its online edition that the man, who it named as Jens R., resided some 2 km (1.2 miles) from the crime scene. A 51-year-old woman from the Lueneburg area in northern Germany and a 65-year-old man from the Borken area near Muenster were killed. Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a statement she was “deeply shaken”. In the months prior to the Berlin assault, Germany suffered a number of small-scale Islamist militant attacks, which some linked to Merkel’s decision in 2015 to open the country’s borders to an influx of migrants, many of them refugees from conflicts in the Middle East. Saturday’s attack in Muenster came a year to the day of a truck attack in Stockholm in which a suspected Islamist militant sympathizer links killed five people.

Google adds fact-checking to news articles  [SEP]  WASHINGTON: Google is adding “fact check” tags to its news articles, introducing the feature amid a US presidential race roiled by heated disputes over the accuracy of information. The move, announced Thursday, will allow readers on Google news applications and websites to click on links to check facts where claims have been evaluated by fact-check organizations. The new feature is being introduced amid a war over facts between many major media outlets and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. It also aims to stem the spread of “fake” news that may spread through social media. “We’re excited to see the growth of the fact-check community and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction, wisdom from spin,” Google news chief Richard Gingras said in a blog post. Google News “determines whether an article might contain fact checks” using an algorithm that evaluates claims and by seeking websites “that follow the commonly accepted criteria for fact checks,” the statement said. Bill Adair, a Duke University journalism professor and founder of the Pulitzer Prize-winning site PolitiFact, called the Google announcement “a huge step for fact-checking.” Trump has forced fact-checkers to work overtime with a seemingly relentless stream of untruths and exaggerations about his past, and he has hit back at the media for damning revelations. On Thursday, Trump savaged US media for reporting “outright lies” that he groped and forcibly kissed women who came forward to tell their stories to news outlets. -AFP
Kenya president says problem with judiciary must be fixed, vows to "revisit" after new election  [SEP]  Kenya's president Uhuru Kenyatta said on Saturday the country has "a problem" with its judiciary that must be fixed, a day after the Supreme Court annulled his election win last month and ordered a new poll within 60 days. NAIROBI: Kenya's president Uhuru Kenyatta said on Saturday the country has "a problem" with its judiciary that must be fixed, a day after the Supreme Court annulled his election win last month and ordered a new poll within 60 days. “We shall revisit this thing. We clearly have a problem," he said, referring to the judiciary. "Who even elected you? Were you? We have a problem and we must fix it," he said, speaking on live television at State House in Nairobi after he met with governor and other elected officials from his Jubilee party. Kenyatta also repeated his message from Friday that he would respect the court's ruling, an unprecedented move in Africa where governments often hold sway over judges. He said via Twitter on Saturday: "For now let us meet at the ballot."

Lung cancer deaths among women expected to increase worldwide: Study  [SEP]  Lung cancer death rates for women worldwide are expected to increase over the next 12 years and the problem will be worse in high-income countries than middle-income ones, according to a new study published Wednesday in the Journal of Cancer Research. Although cancer death rates overall are on a steady decline for women, the study, conducted by researchers in Spain, predicts that lung cancer deaths among women will rise 43 percent globally by 2030, while breast cancer deaths are expected to increase at a much slower rate -- just 9 percent in the next decade or so. The study looked at data for 52 countries between 2008 and 2014 from the World Health Organization's (WHO) Mortality Database. Lung cancer is the deadliest cancer in the world with 1.69 million deaths in 2015 alone, according to the WHO. But while its incidence in men has been declining after experiencing a sharp epidemic, researchers found, the lung cancer epidemic in women has generally started later. According to the American Cancer Society, among women, the specific cancers that lead to death most frequently are breast, colorectal, lung, cervix and stomach cancers. Breast cancer mortality rates have fallen thanks to better prevention and management, the study found. But lung cancer trends in women have been more negative. Although new lung cancer cases over the past 39 years have dropped by 32 percent for men, they have risen 94 percent for women in the U.S., alone, according to the American Lung Association. Lung cancer is, of course, linked to heavy smoking, and to exposure to substances like radon and asbestos. Statistics from Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) predict that smoking rates in women will increase because of increasing social freedom, access to money, and increased marketing of tobacco products to women. The study also recommends that public health officials and lawmakers consider different strategies on how to help women quit smoking (or, better yet, convince them not to start). It’s the easiest way to slow down the projected trend of lung cancer deaths in women. "This research is particularly important because it provides evidence for health professionals and policymakers to decide global strategies to reduce the health, social, and economic impact of lung cancer among women in the future," Dr. Juan Carlos Martínez-Sánchez, one of the leaders of the study, told ABC News. Dr. Lecia Sequist, a medical oncologist who specializes in lung cancer from Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, said she hopes the study's findings will help raise awareness about the growing epidemic of lung cancer in women and its various causes. "The incidence of lung cancer in women who never smoked is rising for reasons that are not yet clear," Sequist told ABC News. "With this in mind, we can not only improve care for individual women (such as considering lung cancer as a possible diagnosis earlier in the work-up for women with respiratory symptoms) but restructure health care policies and research funding priorities to better address modern issues related to lung cancer." Detection is much higher in America for breast cancer than lung cancer, according to JAMA. Additionally, most women are aware that mammograms provide early screening; female smokers aren’t as aware that CAT scans are now available to try to detect lung cancer. Dr. Aditi Vyas is a resident in the ABC News Medical Unit specializing in radiology and occupational and environmental medicine.
What Total’s $4.8 billion investment means for Iran  [SEP]  Iran has signed a $4.8 billion deal with a consortium led by French oil company Total on Monday to develop its giant South Pars gas field, the largest natural gas field in the world. The deal is the Islamic republic's first with a European oil company in more than a decade, marking a major milestone for a country whose standing as an international trade partner has hung in the balance ever since it was slapped with sanctions in 2006 amid concerns that it was developing nuclear weapons. Total has taken a 50.1 percent interest in the South Pars project, and alongside state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, which holds 30 percent, and Iran's Petropars (19.9 percent), will begin producing gas for the Iranian market from 2021. Though the deal has been a slow burn, coming some 18 months after EU sanctions against the Middle Eastern nation were lifted, Iran will be hoping that it marks a new era of investor confidence and a particular boon for its dwindling oil production. "Total's decision to sign the South Pars 11 contract is a cautiously positive sign for foreign investment in Iran's upstream," Richard Mallinson, geopolitical analyst at Energy Aspects, told CNBC via email on Monday.
Officials: Strasbourg market attack suspect killed  [SEP]  STRASBOURG, France — The man authorities believe killed three people during a rampage near a Christmas market in Strasbourg died Thursday in a shootout with police at the end of a two-day manhunt, French authorities said. The Paris prosecutor’s office, which handles terror cases in France, formally identified the man killed in the eastern French city as 29-year-old Cherif Chekatt, a Strasbourg-born man with a long history of convictions for various crimes, including robberies. Chekatt also had been on a watch list of potential extremists. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner, speaking earlier from Strasbourg, said police had spotted a man matching the suspect’s description in the city’s Neudorf neighborhood. “The moment they tried to arrest him, he turned around and opened fired. They replied,” killing the man, Castaner said. Chekatt was suspected of killing three people and wounding 13 near Strasbourg’s Christmas market on Tuesday night. Castaner said earlier Thursday that three of the injured had been released from hospital and three others were still fighting for their lives. “Our engagement against terrorism is total,” French President Emmanuel Macron, who was in Brussels for a European Union summit, said in a tweet thanking security forces. Five people have been arrested in connection with the investigation, including Chekatt’s parents and two of his brothers. The Paris prosecutor’s office said the fifth, who was arrested Thursday, was a member of Chekatt’s “entourage” but not a family member. Witnesses said the gunman shouted “God is great!” in Arabic and sprayed gunfire from a security zone near the Christmas market on Tuesday. Security forces wounded the man but he managed to escape in a taxi, which dropped him off in Neudorf. More than 700 officers searched for Chekatt, government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told CNews television. Authorities said Chekatt had 27 criminal convictions, the first one from when he was 13. A local police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said the man who shot at police Thursday night had been armed with a pistol and a knife. Strasbourg mayor Roland Ries said police had acted on a tip from a woman. A local resident who witnessed the shootout said he heard shots and rushed to the window to see what was happening. He closed the shutters when he spotted the cornered suspect across the street. “I was very afraid for my children, I told them to go away, and I went to the side,” Cem Akcakaya told The Associated Press. After it was over, he said he saw the man motionless on his back on the pavement, his left arm askew. The SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist activity online, said the Islamic State group’s Amaq news agency was claiming the gunman as a “soldier” of the group, although IS claims of responsibility have often been considered opportunistic. Security forces, including the elite Raid squad, spent hours searching in the Neudorf neighborhood where Chekatt had grown up based on “supposition only” he might have been hiding in a building nearby, a French police official said. France has raised its three-stage threat index to the highest level since the attack and deployed 1,800 additional soldiers across the country to help patrol streets and secure crowded events. Residents of Strasbourg’s Neudorf neighborhood expressed relief after Chekatt was killed. “Everybody’s quite happy that the killer has been finally shot. I think now, the city and life can keep going on in Strasbourg,” resident Pierre Plasse said. One of the three who died in Tuesday’s attack was a Thai tourist, 45-year-old Anupong Suebsamarn, according to the Thai Foreign Ministry. Earlier, hundreds of people gathered in Strasbourg’s 500-year-old cathedral to mourn and seek comfort. “Evil does not prevail,” Archbishop Luc Ravel said. “And the message of Christmas has not been contradicted but rather confirmed by Tuesday’s dramatic night: Evil and good are both there, but in the end the good will have last word.” Petrequin and Becatoros reported from Paris. Jean-Francois Badias in Strasbourg, Sylvie Corbet, Deborah Gouffran, and Elaine Ganley in Paris, Colleen Barry in Milan, Italy, Raf Casert and Angela Charlton in Brussels, Belgium, contributed to this story.

Seven killed by suicide bomber targeting soldiers in Afghanistan  [SEP]  At least seven people were killed when a suicide bomber attacked Afghan soldiers in southern Helmand province, Afghanistan officials said. Omer Zwak, spokesman for the provincial governor in Helmand, said on Saturday that 22 others were wounded in the attack, which took place in the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah. Mohammad Rasoul Zazai, spokesman for the army in Helmand, confirmed that three soldiers are among those killed and seven soldiers were wounded. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Taliban insurgents frequently use roadside bombs and suicide attacks to target Afghan security forces as well as government officials across the country.
Federal Judge Delays Ruling on Acosta's White House Press Pass  [SEP]  A federal judge has delayed until Friday a ruling on whether the Trump administration has to return the White House press credentials of CNN reporter Jim Acosta. U.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly didn’t offer any explanation for delaying a ruling that had been expected Thursday afternoon. He’s set a court date for 10 a.m. Friday. Kelly, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, heard arguments Wednesday from lawyers representing CNN and the Justice Department. The news network is seeking an immediate restraining order that would force the White House to hand back Acosta’s credentials, which grant reporters as-needed access to the 18-acre complex. Acosta has clashed repeatedly with Trump and press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders in briefings over the last two years. The White House revoked the pass following a combative press conference last week, a day after Republicans lost control of the House in midterm elections. During the hearing, the Justice Department defended the White House’s decision to strip Acosta of his press pass. The department argued that Acosta is guilty of “inappropriate grandstanding.” The White House took the action after a heated confrontation between Acosta and President Donald Trump during a news conference last week. In a court hearing Wednesday, Justice Department lawyer James Burnham argued that Acosta deserved to lose his access over “his refusal to comply with the general standards of a press conference.” Burnham said that the White House is essentially Trump’s home and office and that the president has some right to decide who can and can’t be there. “There’s no First Amendment right to access the White House grounds,” Burnham said. Burnham also pointed out that CNN has dozens of other staffers with White House credentials, so excluding Acosta would not harm the network’s coverage. CNN is seeking a restraining order that would force the White House to return Acosta’s press credentials. The network’s lawyer, Theodore Boutrous, said Acosta is being singled out for his body of work, not his alleged rudeness. “The White House has made very clear that they don’t like the content of the reporting by CNN and Jim Acosta,” Boutrous said. “Rudeness really is a code word for ‘I don’t like you being an aggressive reporter.'” Trump, in an interview published Wednesday, told The Daily Caller that “guys like Acosta” were “bad for the country. … He’s just an average guy who’s a grandstander who’s got the guts to stand up and shout.” A number of news organizations, including The Associated Press, have announced their intention to file amicus briefs with the court in support of CNN.

Cameroon military says 30 separatists killed in fighting  [SEP]  YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) — Cameroon’s military has killed at least 30 separatists in two days of intense fighting in the turbulent English-speaking North West region, a military spokesman said Wednesday. The military freed people held… YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) — Cameroon’s military has killed at least 30 separatists in two days of intense fighting in the turbulent English-speaking North West region, a military spokesman said Wednesday. The military freed people held by separatists during its two-day operation, military spokesman Col. Didier Badjeck said Wednesday. Fighting was intense in the Mayo Binka area near Nkambe, he said. While no soldiers have been killed, he said the death toll for armed separatists may increase, as fighters escape into the bush. In a separate incident, the mayor of Nwa, a local council in the same region, was found dead Wednesday and he is believed to have been killed by separatists, said Emmanuel Bunyui, the mayor of the nearby town of Ndu. Many mayors in English-speaking regions have been targeted by armed separatists demanding an independent English-speaking state, which they call Ambazonia. “When we hoist the Cameroon flag in the council premises, we are targeted by the armed men who insist that we should instead display their blue and white flag,” Bunyui said. These incidents have highlighted the separatist unrest in Cameroon, which began in 2016, when English-speaking teachers and lawyers in the northwest and southwest staged demonstrations calling for reforms, criticizing what they called the marginalization of the Anglophone population, which accounts for about one-fifth of the country’s 25 million people. Violence increased after factions of separatists armed themselves following a government clampdown on protests in 2017. Armed separatists have vowed to destabilize the regions and hundreds of civilians have been killed and dozens of schools have been burned and teachers threatened. In the past year, more than 1,200 people including separatists, police, military and gendarmes have been killed in the fighting, according to military spokesman Badjeck. Recently 79 students and three staff were kidnapped from a school by suspected separatists, and they have all now been released. More than 100 civilians have escaped the violence and fled to the capital, Yaounde. “I am just going to nowhere. I am afraid,” said Kenneth Kongyu, 19, who joined 75 other people who walked 60 kilometers (37 miles) for two days to escape violence in Ndu, Bunyui’s town. “When they come to the market, they shoot from every angle.” Tatah Oscar, 17, said he is a former fighter. He said many young Cameroonians are joining the separatists because their families have been killed by military “so they don’t have somebody to count on again … I am pleading on the government to try and solve the problem so that we the youths we can go back to school.” Col. Badjeck, however, said “Most of the time the terrorists operate and hide among civilians and the world has an impression that civilians are being killed, but our military is professional.” In November last year, Cameroonian President Paul Biya declared the crisis a war. Biya was re-elected to his seventh term in October, although few votes were cast in war-torn Anglophone regions. Politicians have repeatedly called on Biya to initiate dialogue to stem the violence. The 85-year-old president, who has ruled Cameroon since 1982, has repeatedly stated that Cameroon is one and indivisible and that he is not ready to negotiate. The conflict poses a serious challenge for Cameroon, a close U.S. security ally in combating extremism and a new member of the U.N. Human Rights Council. The United Nations have condemned both the Cameroon military and separatists for using unnecessary and excessive force and Amnesty International criticized the “horrific escalation of violence” in English-speaking regions. Nearly a quarter-million more people have fled the ongoing violence, many leaving their homes on foot with their belongings teetering on their heads. Copyright © 2018 The Associated Press.

New York Trump voters: ‘Enough with the hysteria’  [SEP]  I was asked to go and talk to some Trump voters so I sent out a bunch of text messages and got some very grumpy replies along the lines of,” I don’t know anyone who voted for Trump and if I did I wouldn’t talk to them.” So, I went to Trump Tower on 5th Avenue. Outside, there were NYC sanitation trucks filled with sand as a security measure to deter car bombs, anti-terrorist police with automatic weapons and Kevlar helmets patrol the area. There is a media scrum with reporters doing pieces to camera. There are protests and Trump supporters. I go up to the first Trump supporter I see. Afraid that he might hate the media, I tell him I am not a journalist I am a playwright. He is thrilled to talk to me. He has two signs. The usual Trump/Pence sign and one that reads, Jews for Trump. I ask him if he voted for Trump? He says he didn’t. He is from Israel, but he thinks Trump is great. His name is Yossi. He loves Trump because he will make everyone healthy and he will get rid of all illegal immigrants and the drugs. He has supported him since he came down the escalator in July last year. He has been in America for two years. He does not have a visa. The next man I met was Donald Knoxz, an African-American wearing a red ‘Make America Great Again’ hat and carrying a picture of the candidate. This Donald is from Pennsylvania, but now lives in the East Village. He works in graphics. He is excited by Trump: his morals, his ideas and his intelligence. Trump will encourage upward mobility by cutting taxes on business. His trade deals will create employment. He is excited that Trump is a strong leader who will keep America safe. A first-time Republican voter, he sees himself as anti-establishment. He supports the idea of making US firms manufacture their goods at home. On foreign policy, he believes America should not get into another war and he does not see why they must be fighting with Russia. “Why can’t we just get on with Russia? We don’t have to have a big problem there,” he says. He thinks Trump will scupper Obamacare, but it will not affect him because he has union-organised healthcare. “Donald will do something for people out here. He won’t start a war!” he says, as we are moved along by police. James Rowe was standing nearby. James teaches philosophy at Baruch College in New York. He is from Brooklyn. He was enthusiastic about talking. By now the pavement was getting crowded. A protest group carrying signs with Donald Trump in a KKK hood with a Hitler moustache were marching down the sidewalk in single file chanting, “Not my President!” James broke off his conversation with me to shout at them, “Communism killed thirty million people! It doesn’t work!” The marchers were affiliated with a socialist group. While I was speaking with James on the street,The Naked Cowboy appeared behind him and started posing for pictures with people on the street. James said he became excited by Trump the moment he announced his candidacy back in July 2015. Trump’s nationalist capitalist appeal immediately caught his attention. I asked him which philosophy Trump was channelling, I expected him to say Nietzsche, but James said that Trump was a pure Hegelian, who believes in a strong central government along with a populace that is free and unregimented. Trump represents the unity of interest and freedom restrained by moral leadership that is at the heart of the American ideal, he believed. He praises Trump’s call for state non-interventionism: the American way is to pay your own way. Through that route comes dignity and self-respect. Trump’s victory has come because the state has broken its social contract with a forgotten electorate. On foreign policy Trump will attack Islamic State but not Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. Saddam Hussein was the cork in the bottle in that region and when the cork popped chaos poured out. “We can defeat Isis but we don’t need to defeat Assad. You have to remember we allied ourselves with Stalin to defeat Hitler. And that was under FDR!” On Obamacare: “We have the worst of Socialised medicine with bureaucracy and high costs and the worst of private medicine with no centralized bargaining and high drug costs. Obamacare is essentially a collection of state monopolies and it needs to be opened up to competition to drive the costs down.” James thinks America is a “slightly Pro Life” nation but that abortion should be legislated at state level. Roe v Wade will be altered but not reversed under a Trump Supreme Court, he believes. In the New York Times, Maureen Dowd had used a quote that “Liberals took Trump literally, but not seriously and his supporters took him seriously, but not literally.” I put the three planks of Trumpism to James to test this. The Wall: Yes, Trump will build the wall and begin deporting people: it is essential that the nation state have secure borders. Ban on new Muslim immigration: “Yes, there are elements within, hard core Islamists if you will, that make this necessary. Radical Islam is a worldwide pernicious influence and therefore Islam is not compatible with Western values. Look what happened in Germany when they allowed mass immigration there were mass sexual assaults by migrants.” On workers’ rights, James made a distinction between public sector unions and those representing workers in the private sector. Private sector unions need to be strengthened to mitigate the power of capitalism but public sector unions are too big and have broken the long-held social contract that security of tenure is traded for lower income expectations. Trump’s staff in his New York buildings are all unionised, by the way. I asked James what he would say to the world concerned about Trumps rise to power? “America is still America. The problems of the world are too complex to be solved by any one country let alone any one person. We now realise we must look after our own,” he said. America will not be a philanthropist, he said. Those days are over but it will pursue benign self-interest.” My text messages from earlier paid off. I had some numbers to call. I went home to Greenpoint and made my calls. The first was to Siobhán McCafferty in Staten Island. First generation Irish, her parents came from Sligo and Clare. She was born and raised in Manhattan. Her father was a carpenter but when work was scarce he worked on the Alaska pipeline. She was taught by the Limerick-born writer, Frank McCourt in Stuyvesant High School. Now 49, she is a retired NYPD officer, who was on duty near the World Trade Centre on 9/11. A Democrat, she voted for Bernie Sanders in the primaries. Hillary Clinton is corrupt and electing her to office would merely have perpetuated a broken system, she argues. Her nomination was merely an acknowledgement by the Democrats that it was her turn. She was not the right candidate. Unlike some, however, McCafferty is not fuelled by rage. Political correctness is blinding the left to the fact that things have never been better. Young people are being indoctrinated at school with stories of grievances so they are looking for insults everywhere when they graduate. “We should be looking for common denominators and not diversity, what unites us, what we have in common not what divides us, not skin colour or religion.” In four years’ time, she hopes that people will look back at Trump’s first term and think “You know he actually wasn’t such an asshole. My life is better now. “ On Obamacare, McCafferty quotes GK Chesterton who said that the only way socialism could be introduced to America was through healthcare. She resents it.” It is unfair. Americans don’t like the government telling them what to do. The government should build roads and run the military, they should stay out of places they don’t belong. You wouldn’t want the government running supermarkets, would you? We need more competition in healthcare, not less. Health insurance was good before Obamacare. People weren’t dying on the streets.” However, she does worry about Trump’s hubris. He loves the spotlight, but she thinks he will hire well. His cabinet will do the work, he will make decisions. “I think he will make good ones,” she says. At the end, she returned to Clinton. This time, she quoted Harry Truman’s dictum: “Any politician who gets rich while in office is corrupt.” Clinton is corrupt. Her selection as the Democratic candidate over Bernie Sanders was a coronation and it cost the Democrats the presidency, she argues. It is too difficult to do business in America Kevin Hughes is my last telephone call. A registered Republican, who is socially liberal, pro-choice and gay rights, but fiscally conservative, he feels that the party has been seized by right-wing Christian groups and this has distorted its platform. However, he is dismayed by the corrosive effect of political correctness. The left-wing of the Democrats has made it shameful to be a white capitalist business man. Crazy, he says, since this is the basis of America. “America is defined by capitalism and we can’t turn our back on that. I am a tax-paying businessman; I want better deals for business, and less regulation. Trump is right about that. It is too difficult to do business in America!” I ask him what he would hope for after four years of a Trump presidency, but Hughes is temporarily distracted by “twenty something” protesters moving up Manhattan’s 7th Avenue chanting, “Not my president!” Once he returns to the conversation, he hopes for reconciliation by 2020 between black kids and the police. If America is a hundred-yard dash then white men have an eighty-yard start on black people, he believes. Hughes thinks Americans are thirsting for a leader. The Black Lives Matter campaign is “fighting for the right thing but they have divided rather than united people”, he believes: “The Left shuts down any discussion that doesn’t conform to their orthodoxy.” On trade and foreign policy, Hughes believes the US has been apologetic to the world for too long. Companies cannot be forced to repatriate jobs, but they can be encouraged. Hughes is passionate about the pride taken in work, one that brings purpose to life. It is a feeling shared by everyone I spoke with: Americans just want to belong. When you deprive them of their economic sovereignty, when they can’t work hard and hold their head high they feel adrift. Trump will bring that back. He will make the economic environment more pro-business and he will get business flowing. On Trump’s call for a ban on Muslim immigration, Hughes points out that Trump did say until “we can figure out what is going on”. The media reporting of his statement has been hysterical. Liberals just need to get over themselves and stop seizing on every little thing as if it is the end of the world. The tape on the bus? “People talk like that in private! Stop taking what he says literally. He is speaking metaphorically. The wall, Mexico paying for it all that stuff. Hillary lost because she made some people feel uncomfortable about being American. But honestly I wish I felt better about this guy. I hope he shakes it up. I loved Bill Clinton. As a country, we are not far apart. I think let’s give him a chance. Enough with the hysteria, with the political correctness. Those kids on the street right now are wrong. He is their President. He is our President. I wish I felt better about him, I really do,” says Hughes. Donald Trump got two million votes less than Romney. Hillary Clinton got seven million votes less than Obama. The difference was white men and women. Sense of grieving in New York I am glad that I got to the chance to have the conversations I have had. There is a real sense of grieving in New York. Everyone is despondent. But the people who voted for Trump are not monsters, they want the same things that Democrats want. They listen to different media, they have different beliefs about the world and about politics, race and culture. But they are patriotic in the sense of believing in American ideals. The sense I got from the people I spoke to was that they were glad Trump won but anxious about what would happen now. None of them were very religious so they are not a great sample of the Republican electorate. Climate change, when it was mentioned, was discredited. All of them agree that there is a technological Tsunami coming that will dwarf Nafta in its impact on jobs and the way the economy works. People will need to learn new ways of making a living as their jobs are automated. There was no agreement on how this great retraining should be financed. Was it Governments job to do it or should business undertake it through tax breaks? I felt better about the election result having spoken to earnest rational people who felt they were doing the right thing for America by voting for Trump. I was listening, I didn’t argue with them, so I learned about them. I liked them all. They were rationally self-interested people who exercised their democratic right in way that at the beginning of the day baffled me but at the end of the day I could reconcile. I am still not happy. I am still fearful for the future. But they are, too.
More groups say Duterte must end US-PH military agreements  [SEP]  DAVAO CITY — Various groups are urging President Rodrigo Duterte to end agreements with the United States following his declaration of pushing for an independent foreign policy and the pullout of US Special Forces in Mindanao. Multisectoral organization Sanlakas said they welcome Duterte’s declaration and said he “must go beyond rhetoric by revoking the Visiting Forces Agreement, Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement and similar military agreements with US consistent with its desire to pursue an independent foreign policy.” “In the same vein, sovereignty should be the primordial and an underpinning principle governing how the Philippines should relate to other countries, including China,” the group said in a statement on Tuesday, September 13. In a speech in Malacañang on Monday, September 12, Duterte said the US Special Forces have to leave Mindanao. He said he wanted to review the foreign policy before “Hindi ko lang masalita noon (I just cannot talk about it before), out of respect or I do not want a rift with America, but they have to go,” he said. The President also presented images of the US operations in Mindanao showing Moro people killed violently by US troops during the time of American colonization. He said the images were from a “US archive”. Duterte also announced that he will push for an independent foreign policy following the conclusion of the ASEAN Summit in Vientiane, Laos. “In relations with the world, the Philippines will pursue an independent foreign policy. We will observe and insist – I repeat, I insist – on the time honored principles of sovereign equality, non-interference and commitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes to best serve our people and protect the interests of our country,” he said during the arrival ceremony at the Davao International Airport on Saturday midnight, September 10 Bai Ali Indayla, secretary general of Kawagib Moro Human Rights organization said they appreciate Duterte’s recognition that there were historical injustices committed against the Moro people. She said the government should junk the EDCA and VFA “which we do not need.” “We should stand up as an independent country,” she said. Indayla said Duterte’s actions is a way of telling the US that they have done wrong against the Moro people. “That they have not yet offered any apology and indemnification to afford justice to the victims,” she told Davao Today in an interview during a forum on peace talks at the Ateneo de Davao University Tuesday. “Whatever the President’s objective is for doing it, it was a big thing for us,” she said. She said the pullout of the US troops in Mindanao is not just because of the possibility that they can be targets of attacks, but because the foreign troops were involved in atrocities against the Moro people. “They are not just attacking Moro communities and raping the women, they also trample on our national sovereignty that is why we have been calling for the pullout of US troops long before President Duterte’s pronouncements,” she said. Meanwhile, Anakpawis Partylist Rep. Ariel Casilao said Duterte should emulate former Senator Claro M. Recto who opposed the 1947 Military Bases Agreement, the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty and the Tydings Rehabilitation Act. He said Duterte should ultimately rid of the foreign military forces from the whole country by abrogating EDCA, the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) and the Mutual Defense Treaty. Casilao said that the mere existence of the partial agreements “is contrary to the president’s declaration of an independent foreign policy.” However, Casilao cautioned the president against the maneuvers of the US who would not be taking his criticisms seating down. “This September 11 was the anniversary of the CIA-backed coup d’etat against the democratically elected Allende government of Chile in 1973, and recently left-leaning Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff who garnered 55 million votes during the 2010 elections was impeached by 61 senators,” Casilao said. “They were ousted because they opposed the dictates of US, and its president Barack Obama had the gall to insinuate reminding the president about human rights,” he added. The Communist Party of the Philippines also called on Duterte to remove US troops “not only in Mindanao”. “There are US special forces, army and naval troops operating across the entire country. Under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) of 2014, the US military has set up or is setting-up facilities inside AFP camps such as Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija, Basa Air Base in Pampanga, Antonio Bautista Air Base in Palawan, Benito Ebuen Air Base in Mactan and Lumbia Airport in Cagayan de Oro,” the CPP said in a statement on Tuesday. It said: “US military troops and advisers have long been operating clandestinely inside AFP camps in Cagayan Valley, Bicol, Samar, Panay, Negros and elsewhere. US troops remain stationed in Guian, Samar, which they have not left since 2013 after extending “assistance” in the wake of supertyphoon Yolanda.” It also said that many US soldiers are not Caucasian so as not to attract attention. Thousands of US troops regularly dock at various ports of the country for “rest and recreation” subjecting Filipino women to rape and abuse, the CPP said.
19 dead, 25 missing as migrant boat capsizes north of Cyprus  [SEP]  NICOSIA, Cyprus — Nineteen people drowned when a boat loaded with as many as 150 people who were thought to be migrants capsized off the northern coast of Cyprus, a Turkish Cypriot official said Wednesday. Tolga Atakan, the transport minister in the breakaway north of ethnically divided Cyprus, told The Associated Press that rescue crews were searching for 25 missing passengers in an area where a passing cargo ship reported spotting people in the water. The Turkish coast guard said it rescued 103 of the capsized vessel’s passengers and took them to Turkey. One seriously injured person was being treated at a hospital in the northern part of Cyprus’ capital, Nicosia, Atakan said. Atakan said the nationalities of the passengers have not been confirmed. When asked if they were thought to be migrants, Atakan said “most probably.” Aysegul Baybars, the interior minister in northern Cyprus, told Turkey’s CNN-Turk television that authorities were investigating if bad weather, sabotage or other factors caused the sinking. She said authorities don’t know where the vessel has set sail from or where it was heading. The capsizing occurred around 16 miles (26 kilometers) north of Cyprus’ Karpas Peninsula, but it’s not yet clear when. Thousands of Europe-bound migrants have attempted to cross the Mediterranean Sea from North Africa this year, a dangerous journey often made in overcrowded and inadequate vessels procured by human smugglers. The International Organization for Migration said before the Cyprus wreck that 1,443 people died or went missing this year in the Mediterranean Sea route from northern Africa as of July 15. Friction between the Italian government and private aid groups that patrol the sea to look for people in danger ratcheted up Wednesday when a Spanish aid organization shunned an Italian port for one in Spain. Proactiva Open Arms said it found a survivor and two dead bodies from a migrant boat wreck on Tuesday, and accused Italy of complicity. The Open Arms vessel was expected to arrive on Saturday in the port of Palma de Mallorca, said a Spanish government spokeswoman who was not authorized to be named in media reports. The aid organization accused Libya’s coast guard, which has received training from Italy and funding from the European Union, of abandoning the three people Monday when it took 158 other migrants from the boat and destroyed it. But the aid group also aimed sharp criticism at Italian authorities, who initially granted the Open Arms permission to dock in the Sicilian port of Catania, according to Proactiva. In a statement on Wednesday, the aid group said it did not trust how the Italian government would handle the investigation of Monday wreckage after Interior Minister Matteo Salvini referred to the group’s account as “lies and insults.” The strongman in the new Italian populist government, Salvini has vowed to halt the flow of migrants across the Mediterranean, giving aid to Libyan authorities and vowing to close the country’s ports to aid groups it accuses of helping human traffickers by picking up migrants and bringing them to Europe. Proactiva reported that a woman and a young boy were dead by the time private rescuers found them Tuesday morning in waters some 80 miles off the Libyan coast. Rescuers also found a woman clinging to a piece of wood amid the remnants of a 10-meter-long inflatable boat. Libya’s coast guard denied on Tuesday having left anyone at sea and blamed any deaths at sea on human traffickers and the “presence of such irresponsible, non-governmental groups in the region.” In addition to accusing Libyan coast guards, Proactiva’s director Oscar Camps said Italy was to blame for “enlisting assassins” to “kill and torture” those who try to cross the Mediterranean. “The policies of Matteo Salvini are responsible for this crime,” Camps said in a statement. Salvini responded to the criticism in a tweet that rhetorically asked why the Open Arms vessel was shunning the Italian safe port offer. “Could it be that they have something to hide?” he asked. Humanitarian groups say the pressure being exerted on them by hostile governments is increasing the number of deaths at sea, despite a sharp drop in refugee and migrant arrivals in the European Union since 2015.
Veteran Journalist Javier Valdez Murdered in Mexico  [SEP]  (MEXICO CITY) — Javier Valdez, a veteran reporter who specialized in covering drug trafficking and organized crime, was slain Monday in the northern Mexico state of Sinaloa, the latest in a wave of journalist killings in one of the world's most dangerous countries for media workers. Valdez is the fifth journalist to be murdered in Mexico in just over two months, and the second high-profile reporter to be slain in the country this decade after Regina Martinez Perez, who was killed in 2012. A Sinaloa state government official said Valdez was killed in the state capital, Culiacan, near the offices of the publication he founded, Riodoce. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Riodoce confirmed Valdez's killing on its webpage, saying he was driving about a block from its offices when he was intercepted by gunmen. Valdez was the author of the books "Narcoperiodismo" and "Los Morros del Narco," the latter of which chronicled the lives of young people swept up in Mexico's drug underworld. He was also a correspondent for the national newspaper La Jornada. According to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, in 2009 unknown attackers threw a grenade into the Riodoce offices days after it had published an investigation on drug trafficking. No one was hurt. "Living in Sinaloa is a threat, and being a journalist is an additional threat," he said in an interview with the CPJ, according the group's website. "We learned how to live in times when bullets are flying around us." Sinaloa state is a trafficking hotbed and is home to the Sinaloa cartel headed by notorious kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, who is currently in a New York prison awaiting trial on multiple charges. According to the CPJ, 40 journalists have been killed in Mexico for reasons confirmed as related to their work since 1992. Another 50 were slain during the same period under circumstances that have not been clarified.
Mattis says US competitive warfighting edge has eroded  [SEP]  WASHINGTON (AP) — Countering China's rapidly expanding military and an increasingly aggressive Russia are now the U.S. military's top national security priorities, outpacing the threat of terrorism, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Friday. He said competition with those adversaries has threatened America's military advantage around the world. Laying out a broad new strategy for the Defense Department, Mattis warned that all aspects of the military's competitive warfighting edge have eroded. He said building a force that can deter war with established and emerging military powers in Moscow and Beijing, and U.S. enemies such as North Korea and Iran will require increased investment to make the military more lethal, agile and ready to fight. "We will continue to prosecute the campaign against terrorists that we are engaged in today, but great power competition — not terrorism — is now the primary focus of U.S. national security," Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said in remarks at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. He said the Islamic State group's "physical caliphate" in Iraq and Syria had been defeated, but that IS, al-Qaida and other extremists still pose threats across the globe. Mattis repeated his call for America to work closely with allies and partners — an approach that aligns more closely with previous administrations than President Donald Trump's "America First" ideas. That mantra was repeated in a national security strategy that Trump's administration released in December. The U.S. and its allies, Mattis said, are stronger together. He recalled going to his first NATO meeting last year, carrying Trump's demand for nations to increase their defense spending and thinking about how to fit Trump's message into the broader framework of working with partners. When he got to Brussels, Mattis said he told the alliance: "Here's the bottom line: Please do not ask me to go back and tell Americans — the American parents — that they need to care more about the safety and security and the freedom of your children than you're willing to care for, than you're willing to sacrifice for. We're all going to have to put our shoulder to the wagon and move it up the hill." Did the message resonate? "It's going better than expected," Mattis said Friday. The most dominant theme in his strategy is for the U.S. to regain its competitive edge with China and Russia, according to an 11-page, unclassified version released by the Pentagon. That shift reflects persistent U.S. worries about China's military buildup in the South China Sea, its moves to expand its political and economic influence, and what has been described as Beijing's systematic campaign of cyberattacks and data theft from government agencies and private U.S. corporations. The shift also underscores broad American concerns about Russia, given Moscow's takeover of Ukrainian territory, involvement in Syria's war and alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. "We've been doing a lot of things in the last 25 years, and we've been focused on really other problems and this strategy really represents a fundamental shift to say, look, we have to get back, in a sense, to basics of the potential for war," said Elbridge Colby, the deputy assistant defense secretary for strategy. "This strategy says the focus will be on prioritizing preparedness for war and particularly major power war." Previous defense chiefs long warned about China, and the Obama administration put a greater focus on the Asia-Pacific region, including by adding ships and troops. Colby said the U.S. still seeks areas of cooperation with Russia and China, stressing "this is not a strategy of confrontation." The U.S. has pushed China to increase pressure on North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions. Washington has maintained talks with Russia to ensure no conflicts or accidents in the sky over Syria, where both nations are bombing IS fighters. In the strategy's conclusion, Mattis makes clear his goal is to "pursue change at significant scale" with sustained investment and creative approaches. That plan, however, faces grim budget hurdles. In his speech, Mattis criticized Congress for budget caps that have done more to erode military readiness than any other enemy since 9/11. "For too long we have asked our military to stoically carry a 'success at any cost' attitude, as they work tirelessly to accomplish the mission with now inadequate and misaligned resources, simply because the Congress could not maintain regular order," Mattis said. Lawmakers have been deadlocked on a spending bill, bringing the federal government to the brink of a shutdown at midnight Friday. They're still constrained by the Budget Control Act of 2011, which put mandatory spending caps in place. The Pentagon strategy acknowledges the budget limits, and seeks greater spending discipline and management, along with base closings to save money. Congress has repeatedly rejected additional base closings.
3 killed, 20 injured in van attack in Germany  [SEP]  A delivery vehicle slammed into a crowd Saturday in an apparently deliberate attack in the German city of Muenster, killing three people and leaving 20 others injured, police said. The driver shot and killed himself, a police spokeswoman said. Authorities are treating the incident as a deliberate attack, the spokeswoman said. Muenster police spokesman Andreas Boden told local media that the motive and identity of the driver is unknown. The attack happened in the old part of the western German city, an area popular on weekends. The vehicle drove into a restaurant’s open terrace around 3:30 p.m. local time, according to police spokeswoman Vanessa Arlt. Arlt said the old city remains closed, and police have asked people to avoid the city center. Muenster, with about 300,000 people, is home to numerous universities and has a student population of about 58,000, the city government says. The city calls itself the cycling capital of Germany and says about 100,000 residents use a bike daily. Ulrike Demmer, a spokeswoman for the German government, called news of the attack “horrible” on Twitter. “Our thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones,” she said. Saturday’s crash occurred on the one-year anniversary of a similar attack in Stockholm, Sweden, where a stolen beer struck drove into pedestrians, killing five people.
Researchers find wreckage of WWII-era USS Indianapolis  [SEP]  Researchers say they have located the wreckage of a World War II-era US warship that played a critical role in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima before being struck by Japanese torpedoes. The sinking of the USS Indianapolis remains the US Navy’s single worst loss at sea. The fate of its crew – nearly 900 were killed, many by sharks, and just 316 survived – was one of the Pacific war’s more horrible tales. The expedition crew of Research Vessel Petrel, which is owned by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, said it located the wreckage of the Indianapolis on the floor of the north Pacific Ocean, more than 5,500 metres below the surface, the US Navy said in a news release on Saturday. “To be able to honour the brave men of the USS Indianapolis and their families through the discovery of a ship that played such a significant role in ending World War II is truly humbling,” Allen said. The Indianapolis, with 1,196 sailors and Marines on board, was sailing the Philippine Sea between Guam and Leyte Gulf when two torpedoes from a Japanese submarine struck just after midnight on July 30, 1945. It sank in 12 minutes. There was no time to send a distress signal, and four days passed before a bomber on routine patrol happened to spot survivors in the water. By the time rescuers arrived, a combination of exposure, dehydration, drowning and constant shark attacks had left only one-fourth of the ship’s original number alive. Over the years numerous books recounted the ship’s disaster and its role in delivering key components of what would become the atomic bomb “Little Boy” to the island of Tinian, the take-off point for the bomber Enola Gay’s mission to Hiroshima in August 1945. The Navy statement said a key to finding the Indianapolis came in 2016 when Richard Hulver, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command, determined a new search area. Hulver’s research identified a naval landing craft that had recorded a sighting of the Indianapolis the day before it sank. The research team developed a new search area. The Navy said the 13-person expedition team on the R/V Petrel was surveying the Indianapolis site.
Corona beer owner to pour $4bn into weed  [SEP]  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There are nearly 30 countries pursuing a federally permissible medical cannabis programme Corona beer owner Constellation Brands is set to pour some $4bn (£3.15bn) into Canada's top cannabis producer, Canopy Growth, in a deal marking the largest investment in the industry to date. Last year, Constellation injected $200m into Canopy in a deal to produce a non-alcoholic cannabis-based beverage. The alcohol firm wants to capitalise on the growing legalisation of the drug. On news of the deal, Canopy's Toronto-listed stock surged 30%, while on Wall Street, Constellation's fell 6%. The two firms said the investment would allow Canopy to expand its business reach "in the nearly 30 countries pursuing a federally permissible medical cannabis programme". Canopy, which has the largest legal cannabis production footprint in the world, currently produces cannabis-based oils and soft gel caps, among other products. With Constellation's latest injection of cash, Canopy plans to expand its suite of products to include edible bars, inhalers and pre-rolled items. It also wants to develop cannabinoid-based medicines that provide a safer alternative to some mainstream treatments for pain, anxiety, sleeplessness and psoriasis. "This [deal] marks the end of the warm-up in our sector... it's fully go-time," said Canopy's chief executive Bruce Linton on an investment call. 'Tremendous growth opportunity' Constellation, which makes and markets beer, wine and spirits in the US, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and Italy, noted that governments around the world had already signalled a significant change in attitudes towards cannabis and cannabis-based products. "Over the past year, we've come to better understand the cannabis market, the tremendous growth opportunity it presents, and Canopy's market-leading capabilities in this space," said Rob Sands, chief executive of Constellation Brands. In June, the Canadian government passed a bill which will effectively legalise the recreational cannabis market in the country. The bill is set to be rolled out in October. Constellation's latest investment in Canopy takes its ownership in the firm to 38%. The deal is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be closed no earlier than the end of October.
Another tsunami could hit Indonesia, experts warn  [SEP]  PARIS: Another tsunami could strike Indonesia, experts warned on Sunday (Dec 23), a day after more than 200 people were killed by a wave triggered by a volcanic eruption. The tsunami "appears to have been caused by an underwater collapse" of part of the Anak (or "child of") Krakatoa volcano, said David Rothery of The Open University in Britain. Anak Krakatoa is a new island that emerged around 1928 in the crater left by Krakatoa, whose massive 1883 eruption killed at least 36,000 people. The volcano has been particularly active since June, noted Jacques-Marie Bardintzeff at the University of Paris-South. The tsunami that struck on Saturday was the third to hit Indonesia in six months. Indonesia has 127 active volcanoes and lies on the Pacific Ocean's "Ring of Fire" where earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are frequent. WHY WAS IT SO DEADLY? Anak Krakatoa, located in the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra islands, is close to densely populated zones. And while the tsunami was relatively small, Richard Teeuw of the University of Portsmouth in England said: "Such waves - laden with debris - can be deadly for coastal communities, especially if there is no warning." Simon Boxall of Southampton University added that the region was also in spring tide, "and it would appear that the wave hit some of the coastal areas at the highest point of this high tide, exacerbating the damage done." It also struck at night, further catching people by surprise. WHY WERE PEOPLE NOT WARNED? "We were helpless given how sudden" the event took place, Bardintzeff said. "The time between cause and effect was a few dozen minutes, which was too short to warn the population". "Tsunami warning buoys are positioned to warn of tsunamis originated by earthquakes at underwater tectonic plate boundaries," Rothry said. "Even if there had been such a buoy right next to Anak Krakatoa, this is so close to the affected shorelines that warning time would have been minimal given the high speeds at which tsunami waves travel." COULD MORE TSUNAMIS BE COMING? "The likelihood of further tsunamis in the Sunda Strait will remain high while Anak Krakatoa volcano is going through its current active phase because that might trigger further submarine landslides," Teeuw said. Bardintzeff also warned that "we must be wary now that the volcano has been destabilised". Teeuw said that sonar surveys would now be needed to map the seafloor around the volcano, but "unfortunately submarine surveys typically take many months to organise and carry out," he added. But "devastating tsunami caused by volcanic eruptions are rare; one of the most famous (and deadly) was caused by the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883."
Pound Falls Against Majors  [SEP]  BRUSSELS (dpa-AFX) - The British pound weakened against the other major currencies in the Asian session on Thursday. The pound fell to 1.2727 against the U.S. dollar, 131.57 against the yen and 0.8802 against the euro, from yesterday's closing quotes of 1.2747, 131.91 and 0.8786, respectively. Against the Swiss franc, the pound edged down to 1.2409 from an early high of 1.2428. This may be compared to an early more than 5-year low of 1.2401. If the pound extends its downtrend, it is likely to find support around 1.26 against the greenback, 129.00 against the yen, 0.85 against the euro and 1.22 against the franc.

Freed hostage says Philippine jungle captivity was ‘devastating’  [SEP]  A Norwegian man freed by militants after a year of jungle captivity in the southern Philippines has described the ordeal as “devastating”. Kjartan Sekkingstad was freed by his Abu Sayyaf captors to rebels from the larger Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), which has signed a peace deal with the Philippine government and helped negotiate his release. On Sunday, he was handed over to Philippine authorities, along with three Indonesian fishermen freed separately by Abu Sayyaf. When freed Mr Sekkingstad was carrying a backpack with a bullet hole as a reminder of a near-death experience that included the beheadings of the two Canadians kidnapped with him. The Norwegian said he survived more than a dozen clashes between Philippine forces and his captors in the lush jungles of Sulu province. In one intense battle, in which the forces opened fire from assault helicopters and from the ground, he said he felt a thud in his back and thought he was hit by gunfire. After the fighting eased, he discovered he was not hit and that his green, army-style backpack had been pierced by the gunfire instead. Mr Sekkingstad, heavily-bearded and clad in a rebel camouflage uniform and muddy combat boots, was asked how he would describe his horrific experience. “Devastating, devastating,” he said. Philippine presidential adviser Jesus Dureza, who received Mr Sekkingstad and the three freed Indonesians from MNLF rebel chief Nur Misuari in Mr Misuari’s rural stronghold near Sulu’s Indanan town, accompanied the Norwegian on a flight to the southern city of Davao, where the ex-hostage was to meet President Rodrigo Duterte. Mr Sekkingstad was kidnapped from a yacht club he helped manage on southern Samal Island in September 2015 along with Canadians John Ridsdel and Robert Hall, and Mr Hall’s Filipino girlfriend, Marites Flor. Abu Sayyaf demanded a huge ransom for the release of the foreigners and released videos in which they threatened them. Mr Ridsdel was beheaded in April and Mr Hall was decapitated in June after ransom deadlines lapsed. Ms Flor was freed in June. – (AP)
Louisville must vacate basketball title, NCAA denies appeal  [SEP]  LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Louisville must vacate its 2013 men's basketball title following an NCAA appeals panel's decision to uphold sanctions against the men's program in the sex scandal case. The Cardinals will have to vacate 123 victories including the championship, and return some $600,000 in conference revenue from the 2012-15 NCAA Tournaments. The decision announced on Tuesday by the governing body's Infraction Appeals Committee ruled that the NCAA has the authority to take away championships for what it considers major rule violations. It also refuted Louisville's position that the NCAA exceeded its boundaries and didn't follow its own precedent established in other cases and said in an eight-page decision that ended, "the penalties are upheld." "I cannot say this strongly enough: We believe the NCAA is simply wrong," Louisville interim President Dr. Greg Postel said in a statement. "We disagree with the NCAA ruling for reasons we clearly stated in our appeal. And we made a strong case - based on NCAA precedent - that supported our argument." Louisville now must forfeit its third NCAA title, victories and income from 2012-15, part of the timeframe during which the violations occurred. The decision culminates the governing body's investigation that followed allegations in a 2015 book by escort Katina Powell that former Cardinals basketball staffer Andre McGee hired her and other dancers to strip and have sex with recruits. "From Day One, the university has admitted that the actions of the former operations director and any others involved under previous leadership were offensive and inexcusable," Postel said in the statement. "That is why we apologized immediately, cooperated fully with the NCAA, self-imposed penalties that were appropriate to the offenses and made significant changes to ensure incidents like this never happen again. "Under the NCAA's own rules, this cooperation should have been a factor in the severity of the punishment. Instead, it was ignored." The school's own investigation into the allegation revealed that violations occurred and resulted in a self-imposed postseason ban nearly two years ago. Louisville later imposed scholarship and recruiting restrictions in an effort to mitigate further NCAA discipline. While the NCAA accepted Louisville's actions, it went further with harsher sanctions last June that included: — A five-game suspension of former Cardinals coach Rick Pitino, who was fired in October following Louisville's acknowledgement that it was being investigated in a federal bribery probe of college basketball. That measure included a show-cause penalty for Pitino, whom the NCAA criticized for failing to monitor McGee and ignoring multiple red flags; — Four years' probation, along with the vacation of those wins and appearances in the 2012 and 2013 Final Fours; — Show-cause penalties for McGee, who is no longer coaching; — Postel estimated the return of up to $600,000 in NCAA Tournament revenue. "This dark cloud has hung over our heads for more than two years, and it has had a negative impact on our athletics program, our fans and the entire university family," Postel said. "While we disagree with the NCAA's decision, it is time for the university to close this chapter and move forward with a stronger commitment to excellence on and off the court." Postel, then-athletic director Tom Jurich and Pitino said last summer they planned to fight the sanctions. Pitino, who repeatedly denied knowing about the activities described in Powell's book, was particularly frustrated with his penalties. A lot changed at Louisville in the months following the NCAA penalties. Pitino was placed on unpaid administrative leave and Jurich on paid administrative leave on Sept. 27 following the school's involvement in the FBI probe that initially involved the arrests of 10 people.

Dusseldorf police: Several people injured in ax attack at train station  [SEP]  DUSSELDORF — Five people were injured, one severely, in an ax attack Thursday at Dusseldorf’s main train station, police said. No one was killed, a police spokesman said. “A suspect tried to flee and was injured as well,” said an unnamed spokesman who briefed reporters. Two women were among the injured. One person was arrested but police didn’t identify the suspect. Police are investigating whether other people were involved in the attack. Bruno Macedo, a passenger on a train that was due to stop in Dusseldorf, said the train station was closed and his train was diverted to Cologne.
Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) Tests Critical Support - TimerFrank  [SEP]  Shares of Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE: NEM) are testing a support level that has not been broken in over three years. Newmont Mining Corp. is a gold producer, which is engaged in the acquisition, exploration, and production of gold and copper properties in United States, Australia, Peru, Indonesia, Ghana, Canada, New Zealand and Mexico. At the time this analysis was written on Wednesday, December 5th, Newmont Mining was down almost 2% at $44.22. The support level, at $43.00 a share, has not been reached since late 2009. A break below this level would likely result in considerably lower lows in coming weeks as investors get stopped out at this long term support level. On the flip-side, a solid reversal at this level could point to a tradable rally, though investors who participate should be aware of the stocks huge volatile swings. Newmont Mining was at $70 a share at the end of 2011, and is currently down 37% from that high. The Fibtimer.com (http://www.fibtimer.com) Stock Timing Strategy does not currently have a position in Newmont Mining.

Egypt counts votes, with all eyes on turnout for Sisi's victory  [SEP]  Egyptian officials were counting votes on Thursday after an election set to hand President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi a second term following a crackdown on dissent that removed serious challengers. CAIRO: Egyptian officials were counting votes on Thursday after an election set to hand President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi a second term following a crackdown on dissent that removed serious challengers. As ballots are tallied for official results due on April 2, the focus will be on final turnout since Sisi faced no credible opposition. Critics say the contest recalled the kind of vote that kept Arab autocrats in power for decades before the 2011 Arab Spring. The former military commander overthrew Islamist Mohamed Mursi, Egypt's first freely-elected president, during turmoil in 2013 that followed a popular uprising two years earlier. Sisi was first elected in 2014 with 97 percent of the vote, but with a modest turnout of about 47 percent. Authorities have been desperate to ensure a higher turnout this time around as Sisi sees attendance at polls as a referendum on his popularity and seeks a strong mandate to fight militants and push through tough economic reforms. State-run media trumpeted Sisi's victory early on Thursday after the election predicted a "big turnout", and radio programmes said that most of the voters were from Egypt's fast-growing youth. "The people have chosen their president", the front page of state-run daily al-Gomhouria said. Early indications from sources monitoring the vote, however, suggested turnout could be lower than in the 2014 election. On the first two days of voting, turnout was about 21 percent, two sources monitoring the election said, and a Western diplomat said that late on Tuesday it was between 15 and 20 percent. The two sources said late on Wednesday the turnout figure could be less than 40 percent. Egyptian authorities and media outlets have tried to garner as many votes as possible, telling voters it is their duty, and portraying a failure to vote as betrayal of their country. Other tactics have also been deployed, with some voters saying they were paid and given other incentives to cast their ballots. Sisi ran against a sole challenger who openly supports him, after all serious opposition dropped out the race earlier this year citing intimidation and arrests. Sisi's presidency has returned the military to power after turmoil following the 2011 uprising that toppled long-time leader Hosni Mubarak.
Hurricane Florence: Track the storm set to hit East Coast as major storm this week  [SEP]  Grocery stores are restocking shelves with water and bread, and supply stores are selling a lot of plywood and generators Monday as East Coast communities prepare for Hurricane Florence to strike hard later this week. The National Weather Service at noon ET upgraded Florence to a Category 4 storm, meaning it is capable of creating “catastrophic” damage. Florence now has maximum sustained winds of 130 mph, the center said. Further strengthening is expected, as Florence moves toward North and South Carolina, where it could unleash its fury as the most powerful storm to hit the region in three decades. Tourists and residents were outside Sunday enjoying pleasant weather, but by Monday emergency management workers had been told to buckle up for what could be a very long week. “This storm gets stronger and stronger” and is on its way to a head-on impact on the Carolinas, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. A mandatory evacuation order was issued for North Carolina’s Hatteras Island starting at noon Monday, Dare County Emergency Management. said. The order extends to all residents and visitors in other areas of Dare County beginning at 7 a.m. on Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center forecasts Florence to hit the shore late Thursday night or early Friday morning. Swells up to 15 feet could batter the coast, Myers said, and the storm system is likely to stall when it crosses land, dumping up to 20 inches of rain on some inland locations. Florence was about 575 miles southeast of Bermuda as of noon ET Monday, or about 1,230 miles from Cape Fear, North Carolina. The storm was moving west at 13 mph, the hurricane center said. The center of the hurricane was forecast to move between Bermuda and the Bahamas on Tuesday and Wednesday and approach the US coast on Thursday as a Category 3 storm or higher, according to the hurricane center. “There is an increasing risk of life-threatening impacts from Florence: storm surge at the coast, freshwater flooding from a prolonged and exceptionally heavy rainfall event inland, and damaging hurricane-force winds,” the hurricane center said. It warned people at the coast and inland from South Carolina to the mid-Atlantic region to monitor the storm’s progress closely and ensure they have a hurricane plan in place. Large swells generated by Florence are already affecting Bermuda and portions of the East Coast and will continue this week. “These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents,” the hurricane center said. Track the storm and compare different forecast models The governors of Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina have declared states of emergency. “We are preparing for the worst, and of course hoping for the best,” South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said, adding that his declaration would allow state agencies to deploy assets quickly to the coast. The state has begun enforcing a law against price gouging. McMaster and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper have asked President Donald Trump for a federal disaster declaration. That would make state and local agencies eligible for Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursement of some costs. Cooper told residents on Monday to get ready to be without power for an extended period. “North Carolina is taking Hurricane Florence seriously, and you should, too,” Cooper said. He said he expects other coastal communities to follow Dare County and order evacuations either Monday or Tuesday. Earlier, Cooper waived certain transportation restrictions so that farmers could harvest and move crops more quickly. Cooper also urged people to learn what evacuation routes to take, and put fuel in their vehicles in case they’re ordered to leave. “Action today can avoid losses due to Florence,” he said. Crystal Kirwan and her family were preparing to leave their home in Moyock, North Carolina on Monday. “This one is hard,” she told CNN. “We live paycheck to paycheck, being a military family, and it’s four days until payday.” She, her husband and children will make the four-and-a-half-hour drive to family in Dover, Delaware, as soon as he is cleared from duty. “Probably not too much better, but most likely safer than here,” she said. Meanwhile, crowds formed at supermarkets starting Sunday as people tried to stock up on supplies. Erin Byrd checked in online from Publix in Apex, North Carolina. “Water supplies being depleted. … Bread and milk supplies still robust,” she posted on Instagram. “We don’t panic, which is why we are amused that water was so depleted a week out. We still have water supply from last year here,” she told CNN. Alicia Buchanan posted on Instagram from Walmart in Rock Hill, South Carolina. She just moved to the area two weeks ago from Northern Virginia and still doesn’t have her furniture. “So, I’m prepping with some bottled water, a couple puzzle books, and making sure all my electronics and back-up batteries are charged,” she told CNN. “I plan to do most of my cooking on the grill.” Preparations for Florence come as the Atlantic hurricane season hits its peak. Two other storms also are churning in the Atlantic. Hurricanes Helene and Isaac are not expected to hit the US mainland. Monday is the climatological peak date of hurricane season, the height of the eight-week period when the most powerful storms usually form, CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri said. The Atlantic hurricane season officially began June 1, but cooler water and higher wind shear — winds moving at different speeds and directions — early in the season are less than ideal for tropical systems to gain and maintain strength. Storms increase in frequency and intensity by mid-August and into September as temperatures in the Atlantic climb to their highest levels, Javaheri said. “Take mid-August to mid-October, that period accounts for 87% of category 1 and 2 hurricane days and a staggering 96% of ‘major’ hurricane days — (Categories 3, 4 and 5),” he said. “By late October, wind shear once again increases and the cooler autumn air filters farther south, allowing waters to begin their inevitable cooling process.” CNN meteorologist Gene Norman compared the conditions to boiling water on a stove, with the water taking a while to react to an increase and then decrease in the temperature of the element beneath it. “Even though the season starts in June, the Earth is just beginning to warm up from the summer sun. By mid/late August, temperatures near their peak, like that pot on the stove starting to boil,” he said. “However, just as it takes a while to heat the ocean, it also takes a while for the latent heat stored there to dissipate, like that pot on the stove. This is why there can be strong storms lingering into October.”
Somalia on the brink of famine, U.N. warns  [SEP]  The United Nations is warning that Somalia could soon be facing a famine without urgent international action, raising concerns about a repeat of 2011's famine which killed more than a quarter of a million people. The country is in a severe drought after two seasons of weak rainfall, the U.N. said in a statement. "In the worst affected areas, inadequate rainfall and lack of water has wiped out crops and killed livestock, while communities are being forced to sell their assets, and borrow food and money to survive," the U.N. says. "If we do not scale up the drought response immediately, it will cost lives, further destroy livelihoods, and could undermine the pursuit of key State-building and peacebuilding initiatives," said the Humanitarian Coordinator for Somalia, Peter de Clercq. The number of people in need of assistance is rising rapidly. In September, that figure was at 5 million people – now, it's over 6.2 million. There are growing concerns about the possible human toll, but de Clercq emphasized that at this point, famine is not a foregone conclusion. "A drought — even one this severe — does not automatically have to mean catastrophe if we can respond early enough with timely support from the international community," he said. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization's Somalia representative, Richard Trenchard, pointed out some of the warning signs: "Labour prices are collapsing; local food prices are rising; food availability is becoming patchy; animal deaths are increasing; and malnutrition rates are rising, especially among children." Conditions are particularly severe in the rural area of Puntland, he said. And as NPR's Gregory Warner explained, it's rare for a famine to officially be declared, and can come after much of the damage has already occurred: "Consider Somalia, a country that's been mired in war and chaos for more than two decades. When [the U.S. government's Famine Early Warning Systems Network] declared famine there in 2011, aid money poured in, as did television cameras. The famine was quickly defeated. "But by the time the Somali famine was officially declared, at least half of its 260,000 victims had already died. So by the time conditions become so dire that they warrant the famine label, it can be too late." Somalia also faces regular militant attacks from the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab group. The country is currently going through a historic political process. It has sworn in a new Parliament and is in the process of planning presidential elections.
Weekly Standard, conservative magazine that criticized Trump, is shutting down  [SEP]  The Weekly Standard, the once influential conservative magazine that has been sharply critical of President Donald Trump, will publish its final issue next week, the magazine’s publisher announced Friday. The magazine, founded by William Kristol and Fred Barnes under News Corp., published its first issue on September 18, 1995. Clarity Media Group acquired the publication in 2009. Kristol, a prominent conservative pundit, was among the most vociferous critics on the right of Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. He did not let up on his criticism once the president took office. Weekly Standard editor-in-chief Stephen Hayes said he was “profoundly disappointed” by Clarity’s decision to close the magazine. “For nearly a quarter century, TWS has provide an unapologetically conservative and fiercely independent voice on American culture and public affairs,” Hayes wrote on Twitter. “That voice is needed now more than at anytime in our previous 23 years.” More: William Kristol on immigration, Donald Trump, Paul Ryan and Ron Johnson Clarity CEO Ryan McKibben said the decision was driven by a nosedive in subscribers that began well before Trump’s run for the White House. "The Weekly Standard has been hampered by many of the same challenges that countless other magazines and newspapers across the country have been wrestling with," McKibben said. "Despite investing significant resources into the publication, the financial performance of the publication over the last five years – with double-digit declines in its subscriber base all but one year since 2013 – made it clear that a decision had to be made.” Kristol, who used the pages of The Weekly Standard to push for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, has served as an adviser to Vice President Dan Quayle and the late Sens. John McCain, R-Arizona, and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-New York. The magazine might have reached its pinnacle of influence during President George W. Bush, when Washingtonians in the know jokingly referred to it as the in-flight magazine of Air Force One. It as published the works of prominent the conservative journalists and commentators Max Boot, Charles Krauthammer, John Podhoretz and others. Its demise seemed imminent after Clarity announced this month that the Washington Examiner, which it also publishes, would expand its national distribution. Kristol embraced the “Never Trump” movement, and the magazine frequently posted commentary taking the president to task over his policy and controversial statements. The Washington Examiner has featured a broader array of commentary on Trump. “All good things come to an end,” Kristol wrote on Twitter. “And so, after 23 years, does The Weekly Standard. I want to express my gratitude to our readers and my admiration for my colleagues. We worked hard to put out a quality magazine, and we had a good time doing so. And we have much more to do. Onward!”
The best tweets capturing the joy and boredom of the Winter Olympics.  [SEP]  Those competing in the Winter Olympics have dedicated their lives to the sport of their choice. They live, breathe, and eat speedskating or Alpine ski racing. Most viewers, however, are casual watchers of the international sporting event and still have not gotten a grasp on WTF curling is. Frankly, not all of us have the time to devote ourselves to the Olympics, like Leslie Jones has. This lack of familiarity with the sport and a universal bewilderment at the dedication athletes put into their career is a great way to bond with people, whether they be in real life or on the internet. Here are ten tweets from internet people (who are so often preferable to real people) who aren't completely in tune with the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics—or whose indifference has been transformed into rapt obsession. ME, watching the olympic ice dancing: this is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my life. this is the pinnacle of human achievement. i am weeping ANNOUNCER: this pathetic worm held her arm kind of weird on the landing. she has shamed her country and family ME: oh. okay — lust-cait of the gutters (@chaeronaea) February 11, 2018
Scaramucci out after 11 days in White House job  [SEP]  Anthony Scaramucci is out as White House communications director after just 11 days on the job. A person close to Scaramucci confirmed his ouster just hours after President Donald Trump's new chief of staff, John Kelly, was sworn into office. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the change before it was officially announced. Scaramucci has been in the spotlight since he was first announced as communications director earlier this month. The New Yorker magazine published an interview Thursday in which Scaramucci went on a profanity-laden tirade against Reince Priebus, then chief of staff. Kelly, a retired general and previous Homeland Security secretary, was sworn into his new job Monday morning.
FIFA to expand World Cup to 48 teams  [SEP]  ZURICH — FIFA will expand the World Cup to 48 teams, adding 16 extra nations to the 2026 tournament that is likely to be held in North America. President Gianni Infantino’s favored plan — for 16 three-team groups with the top two advancing to a round of 32 — was unanimously approved Tuesday by the FIFA Council. It meets Infantino’s election pledge of a bigger and more inclusive World Cup going beyond European and South American teams, which have won all 20 titles. “We have to shape the football World Cup of the 21st century,” said Infantino, who also promised funding increases for FIFA’s 211 member federations at his election last February. With 80 matches instead of 64, FIFA forecasts the equivalent of $1 billion extra income at current rates from broadcasting and sponsor deals, plus ticket sales, compared to $5.5 billion revenue forecast for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. FIFA projects an increased profit of $640 million despite some extra operating costs and prize money for teams. FIFA’s six continents should find out by May how many extra places they will each get. “No guarantees have been made,” Infantino said. “The only sure thing is that obviously with 48 teams everyone will have a bit more than they have today.” UEFA wants 16 European teams at the tournament, which is strongly favored to be played in North America. The CONCACAF region has not hosted the World Cup since the 1994 tournament in the United States. American, Canadian and Mexican soccer leaders have had informal talks about a co-hosting bid. FIFA members are scheduled to pick the host in May 2020, though there could be little competition in a process Infantino said must be “bullet-proof” to meet all integrity rules. Africa and Asia could be winners in a bigger World Cup with up to nine places each. They had only five and four teams, respectively, at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Still, FIFA said it expects the standard of soccer to drop compared to the 32-team format locked in for the next two World Cups in Russia and Qatar. The “absolute quality” of play, defined by high-ranked teams facing each other most often, is achieved by 32 teams, FIFA acknowledged in a research document sent to members last month. It made 10,000 tournament simulations to reach that conclusion. Instead, Infantino wants to create fervor and months of anticipation back home in the 16 extra nations which would qualify, some probably making their World Cup debut. FIFA has pointed to Costa Rica, Wales and Iceland as examples of teams which overachieved at recent tournaments. FIFA must break with soccer tradition to make its new format work after an original 48-team plan — with an opening playoff round sending 16 “one-and-done” teams home early — was unpopular. Instead, three-team groups will replace the usual groups of four to create simple progress to a knockout bracket. However, it leaves one team idle for final group games and could risk collusion between the other two teams. FIFA said it could guard against result-rigging by introducing penalty shootouts after group games that end in draws. Infantino said a decision could wait until 2024 to agree on competition rules. Despite the 16 extra games, FIFA believes the current maximum of stadiums needed will stay at the 12 used by Brazil and Russia. However, the demand for more training bases and hotels means developed countries would be better equipped to win future hosting contests. North America is the strong favorite for 2026 because European and Asian countries are blocked by a FIFA rule excluding continents which hosted either of the two previous tournaments. Russia will host the World Cup next year and Qatar in 2022. South America has been focused on a centenary tournament including original 1930 host Uruguay, and African nations are seen as lacking existing capacity and unlikely to fund multi-billion dollar infrastructure spending.
Malaysia reports first case of pregnant woman with Zika virus  [SEP]  27-year-old lives in state next to Singapore, where 275 cases have been recorded, as Malaysia fears full-blown outbreak This article is more than 3 years old This article is more than 3 years old Malaysia has reported its first case of a pregnant woman with Zika, who lives in a state bordering Singapore where authorities have already recorded 275 cases. The 27-year-old woman in the southern state of Johor is the third person with Zika in Malaysia, where fears of a full-blown outbreak emanating from Singapore are mounting. Infected pregnant women can give birth to babies with microcephaly, a deformation marked by abnormally small brains and heads. WHO recommends safe sex for people returning from Zika-affected zones Read more “The woman is expecting her first child and is three to four months pregnant,” Malaysia’s health minister, S Subramaniam, said in a statement on the ministry’s Facebook page. Last week, Malaysia reported its first case of Zika in a woman believed to have caught the virus in Singapore. On Saturday, it reported its first suspected locally transmitted case, a man in the eastern state of Sabah. The man, who had no recent history of overseas travel, was already in fragile health and subsequently died of heart-related complications. Subramaniam said it was not clear how the pregnant woman had contracted Zika, but she had visited Singapore six months ago and her husband regularly made trips to the city state. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Malaysia’s health minister, Dr S Subramaniam, reveals the case of a pregnant woman with Zika. Photograph: Ahmad Yusni/EPA Subramaniam said authorities had inspected a wide area around her home and other places she had recently visited, and they were being fogged with mosquito-killing chemicals. Zika, which is spread mainly by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, has been detected in 67 countries and territories, including Brazil. Malaysia has struggled in recent years to control the spread of dengue fever, which is also transmitted by mosquitoes. It has stepped up screening of travellers from abroad, particularly Singapore, and is fogging with insecticides. Members of the public have been urged to eliminate mosquito breeding sites such as stagnant water. Zika has been spiralling in Singapore since the beginning of September, with health officials updating the number of cases to 275 on Tuesday, including two pregnant women. Authorities have said the virus is likely to spread further.
Magnitude 7.2 quake at sea shakes Central America as hurricane hits  [SEP]  A strong earthquake off the Pacific Coast of Central America shook the region on Thursday, and could prompt hazardous tsunami waves, U.S. monitoring agencies said, just as a hurricane barreled into the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Costa Rica. The 7.2 magnitude quake struck at a depth of 33 kilometers, some 154 kilometers (96 miles) south-southwest of Puerto Triunfo in El Salvador, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The Pacific tsunami warning center said "hazardous tsunami waves are possible for coasts located within 300 kilometers (186 miles) of the earthquake epicenter." Earlier on Thursday, category 2 Hurricane Otto hit land near the southeastern coast of Nicaragua, where thousands had already been evacuated away from vulnerable coastal areas and into shelters.
2 victims dead, 4 wounded after gunman opens fire, kills himself at Tallahassee yoga studio  [SEP]  A Friday evening of unwinding, dinner and cocktails at an upscale Midtown shopping enclave was shattered by an unidentified assailant who walked into a yoga studio and began shooting. Two people were fatally wounded before he turned the gun on himself and killed himself. At least five others were wounded, Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo said. The gunman has been tentatively identified but his name has not been released, DeLeo. "The main focus for us is positively identifying the suspect and what his link to our victims is," DeLeo said at a 10 p.m. briefing. Hours earlier, officials reported one person was in critical condition at Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare, three were in serious condition, and two in good condition, said hospital spokeswoman Danielle Buchanan. It is unclear which of the victims died. One of those taken to the hospital died, officials said. City spokeswoman Alison Faris confirmed the shooter at Hot Yoga Tallahassee died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after the incident at the yoga studio located on the second floor the Betton Place shopping complex on the corner of Thomasville and Bradford roads. There were 11 people signed up for the 5:30 p.m. hot yoga flow class and one canceled earlier in the day, a source said. The class instructor is said to have been uninjured. The 911 call came in at 5:37 p.m. City Commissioner Scott Maddox was among the many city officials who immediately went to the scene. "In my public service career, I have had to be on some bad scenes. This is the worst. Please pray," Maddox posted on Facebook. Alex Redding was in the Bar at Betton downstairs at the shopping center when a woman ran in hyperventilating followed by a man with blood on his head. Redding said two to three other people entered the bar seeking help and said a tall man with a beard was inside the Hot Yoga studio acting strange and began shooting during the class. The man with blood on his head told the patrons he tried to stop the shooter but was pistol-whipped before the man shot himself. The incident swiftly interrupted the gubernatorial campaign of Mayor Andrew Gillum who was joined by former President Brack Obama earlier in the day in South Florida. Gillum tweeted he was "deeply appreciative of law enforcement's quick response to the shooting at the yoga facility in Tallahassee today." "No act of gun violence is acceptable," he wrote. "I'm in close communication with law enforcement officials and will be returning to Tallahassee tonight." About three hours after the shooting, Gillum's Republican rival Ron DeSantis tweeted: "The news of the shooting in Tallahassee is heartbreaking. Casey and I are praying for the families of the victim whose life was tragically taken tonight and those taken to the hospital with injuries." When the crime was reported, dozens of police cruisers and other emergency vehicles raced to the scene from all over the city. Shortly after the shooting, Gov. Rick Scott, who is running for U.S. Senate, spoke to DeLeo, Leon County Sheriff Walt McNeil and Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner Rick Swearingen. "I have been briefed by FDLE and local law enforcement regarding the shooting in Tallahassee," he tweeted. "FDLE is on the scene and assisting local police. I will remain in constant communication with law enforcement. We have offered state assistance." Megan Nixon was eating downstairs at Riccardo’s Restaurant when she heard the commotion at the yoga studio upstairs. “We heard pop, pop, pop. It sounded intense,” Nixon said. About 30 seconds later, she saw two young women run into Bar of Betton next door. Then, she saw a guy, bloodied, run in. “The gun shot six or seven times. I saw five different ambulances picking people up," she said. "It’s scary it’s so close to home.” Nixon said the owner of the restaurant locked the door to protect those inside. She struggled to understand the events that interrupted what was supposed to be a family evening out. "It’s so terrible. Why would he have skipped all the other business and go up to the Yoga studio?” Nixon asked. “It’s terrible. It’s hard when you have a 2-year-old. I hate this for Tallahassee. I hate this for these girls." Shanta Combs was sitting at the Bar on Betton having drinks with her boyfriend and a friend when the chaos erupted. “It’s a little surreal still," she said. “It’s still hard to wrap your brain around, you know?” Everything happened so quickly, Combs said. First, the girl ran in breathing heavily, like she is in labor. Then someone yelled, "'Oh my god he’s bleeding.' I am right at the end of the bar and see this kid in a white t-shirt with blood coming out of his forehead.” Almost simultaneously she said a bartender yelled, "'Active shooter. Active shooter. Get down. Get away from the window!'" Then everyone gots off their stools and scrambled on their knees back to the kitchen area. Combs hugged the first girl who came into the bar. “It was so chaotic,” Combs said. Police gathered eyewitnesses in the courtyard, sent the injured off in ambulances and others to another location. Police dogs outside were looking for shell casings, forensic teams came in. “We stayed inside and commiserated,” she said. “There was a lot of hugging, a lot of crying, a lot of thank yous, and holy shits among total strangers tonight. You don’t witness something like that.” About three hours after the shooting, two yoga instructors stood across the street behind the police tape watching lights flash outside of their studio. Tears poured down their faces. They were not ready to talk. © Gannett Co., Inc. 2018. All Rights Reserved

Venezuela prison fire kills 68; victims’ kin clash with police  [SEP]  The South American nation of Venezuela, which is passing through gruelling hardships politically and economically, was in for yet another shock on Wednesday, March 28, when a fire at a police station in the city of Valencia in the state of Carabobo left 68 people dead. The blaze reportedly spread after the prisoners in the station reportedly set fire to mattresses in a bid to escape but it terribly backfired. The incident was followed by turmoil as the police used tear gas to disperse the kin of those who were killed. The law-keepers swung into action after the victims' worried relatives surrounded the police station to know whether their dear ones were safe. Authorities said a probe into the incident would begin at the earliest. Carabobo went into mourning after the tragedy. Though the reason behind the fire was not officially confirmed, officials said soon after a police officer was shot in the leg by a detainee that the prisoners set fire to mattresses in the jail and it spread fast to kill several. Two among the dead were visitors to the jail, it was told. While some were charred, others died of asphyxiation. As soon as the news of the fire broke, the relatives of the prisoners rushed to the police station and clashed with the police to know how their kin was inside. Venezuela is notorious for its overcrowded prisons as more and more people are put behind bars because of regular violence and riots. The country is one of the most unstable in the world with a strong economic crisis. The prison in Valencia where the fire tragedy occurred was a temporary one.

Yemen Now Faces 'The Worst Cholera Outbreak In The World,' U.N. Says  [SEP]  Seized by violence and teetering on the edge of famine, Yemen is grappling with another danger that threatens to outpace them both: cholera. "We are now facing the worst cholera outbreak in the world," international health authorities said in a statement Saturday. Anthony Lake, executive director of UNICEF, and Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization, say that "more than 1,300 people have died — one quarter of them children — and the death toll is expected to rise." That's because they suspect Yemen now has upwards of 200,000 cases to grapple with, and that number is only growing quickly — by a rate of roughly 5,000 cases a day. "And geographically it is expanding," Mohamed El Montassir Hussein, Yemen director for the International Rescue Committee, told NPR's Jason Beaubien earlier this month. "It's not a small area. It's almost the whole country." "There is nowhere in the country you can say this place is better than another," says Hussein. "Every family is suffering from something whether it's cholera or lack of food, having child soldiers in the family or having someone go join the rebels or the military. There's been a whole collapse of the social life." After more than two years of civil war, Yemen's health care system is at risk of "complete collapse," a UNICEF spokesman told Jason. The country has been roiled by violence since Houthi rebels seized power and ousted the president, who fled to sanctuary in neighboring Saudi Arabia. Since then, a Saudi-led coalition supported by the U.S. has waged a protracted campaign against the rebels — and some worry that support makes the U.S. complicit in Yemen's deepening humanitarian crisis. "There's a U.S. imprint on every civilian death inside Yemen that's caused by the Saudi bombing campaign," Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut told NPR's Michele Kelemen last month after the U.S. signed a new arms deal with Saudi Arabia. "The Saudis simply could not operate this bombing campaign without us," he continued. "Their planes can't fly without U.S. refueling capacity. They are dropping munitions that we've sold them. We are standing side by side with them often when they are reviewing intelligence about targets." Saudi Arabia's new crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman — who, as NPR's Deborah Amos reports, is said to have been "the prime mover in the kingdom's decision to go to war in Yemen" — recently authorized a $66 million donation to support UNICEF and WHO's anti-cholera efforts there. "We look forward to discussing this contribution with the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre," UNICEF responded in a statement Friday. "Such generosity will make a great difference to thousands of children at risk of contracting this rapidly spreading disease." Lake and Chan made clear Saturday just how rapid it's spreading — and, in turn, just how rapid the response needs to be. "We are working around the clock to detect and track the spread of disease and to reach people with clean water, adequate sanitation and medical treatment. Rapid response teams are going house-to-house to reach families with information about how to protect themselves by cleaning and storing drinking water," they said. "We call on authorities in Yemen to strengthen their internal efforts to stop the outbreak from spreading further."
Mattis farewell to Pentagon staff: 'Hold fast' to US defense  [SEP]  WASHINGTON (AP) — On his final day as defense secretary, Jim Mattis today urged all Pentagon employees, military and civilian, to "hold fast" in defense of the nation. Mattis, who submitted his resignation Dec. 20 and was, in effect, fired by President Donald Trump three days later, was working in the Pentagon and preparing to hand off his duties at midnight to Deputy Secretary Patrick Shanahan. The president picked Shanahan, a former Boeing Co. executive with no previous government or military experience, to serve as acting defense secretary, pending a decision on who would be nominated to serve in a more permanent capacity. Mattis has not said publicly what he intends to do next. He has mused about returning to his roots in Washington state. He was born in Pullman and raised in Richland. He graduated from Central Washington University in 1971 and then entered the Marine Corps, where he began as a second lieutenant and rose to the rank of four-star general. In a written farewell message, Mattis quoted a one-sentence telegram that President Abraham Lincoln sent to the commander of Union forces, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, on Feb. 1, 1865, in the final weeks of the Civil War. It said: "Let nothing which is transpiring, change, hinder, or delay your military movements, or plans." On that date, Lincoln signed a joint congressional resolution proposing a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery. Mattis, who resigned over a series of policy disagreements with Trump, including over the president's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, said he's confident Pentagon employees will remain "undistracted from our sworn mission to support and defend the Constitution while protecting our way of life." "Our Department is proven to be at its best when the times are most difficult," he wrote. "So keep the faith in our country and hold fast, alongside our allies, aligned against our foes." Mattis had initially said he planned to serve as head of the Defense Department through February to ensure an orderly transition. But the fallout of his decision to leave – including the shock and dismay expressed on Capitol Hill – annoyed Trump, who accelerated Mattis' departure to Jan. 1.

Somalia blast kills at least 16 near presidential palace  [SEP]  Somalia blast kills at least 16 near presidential palace NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — An explosives-packed vehicle detonated at a military checkpoint near Somalia's presidential palace, killing at least 16 people and wounding more than 20 others, police said. The al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab extremist group, which often targets Mogadishu, claimed responsibility for the attack. Those killed include three staffers from the London-based Universal TV station, including prominent journalist Awil Dahir Salad, said police Capt. Mohamed Hussein, who gave the toll of dead and wounded. The bomber targeted the checkpoint near the rear entrance of the heavily fortified palace, Hussein said. A lawmaker and a deputy mayor of Mogadishu were among those wounded, he said. Soldiers also were among the dead, Col. Ahmed Mohamud said. The blast and a second, smaller one nearby appeared to target those heading to work on what was a business day in the Horn of Africa nation. A plume of smoke rose over the capital as ambulances rushed to the scene. "At first I saw a vehicle driving to and fro, then we tried to stop people walking here and there, and then in the blink of an eye the vehicle exploded, causing havoc," traffic police officer Mohamed Harun told The Associated Press. Al-Shabab, the most active Islamic extremist group in sub-Saharan Africa, was pushed out of Mogadishu years ago but continues to control large parts of rural southern and central Somalia. The U.S. military, which partners with Somali forces and a 20,000-strong African Union peacekeeping mission, has greatly increased airstrikes against al-Shabab under the Trump administration. At least 47 U.S. strikes have been carried out this year. Associated Press video journalist Mohamed Sheikh Nor in Mogadishu contributed.
US Plans to Shut Down Dakota Access Oil Pipeline Protest Camp  [SEP]  BISMARCK, N.D. – The Army Corps of Engineers’ plan to close a Dakota Access pipeline protest camp that’s been around for more than six months isn’t likely to be the demise of on-the-ground opposition in North Dakota. Wednesday’s deadline for the protesters to leave also may not spell the end of heavy law enforcement presence near where the Dallas-based developer is finishing the last big section of the pipeline, which will carry oil from North Dakota through the Dakotas and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. The protest camp is on federal land in southern North Dakota between the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and the pipeline route. It has at times housed thousands of people, though it’s dwindled to just a couple hundred as the pipeline battle has largely moved into the courts. The Corps has told those who remain in the Oceti Sakowin camp that they needed to leave by 2 p.m. Wednesday. Gov. Doug Burgum listed the same time and date in an emergency evacuation order last week. Large-scale arrests are possible at the camp Wednesday, said Morton County sheriff’s spokeswoman Maxine Herr, but she insists that’s not want authorities want. Though law enforcement and state officials in the past said they wouldn’t forcibly evict protesters, they now cite the coming threat of spring flooding as a safety issue that requires clearing the camp. “We prefer to handle this in a more diplomatic, understanding way,” she said, adding that a transition center will be set up to help protesters who don’t have a place to go. Some protesters plan to move, but some in the camp are ready to go to jail and “will engage in peaceful, civil resistance … holding hands, standing in prayer,” said American Indian activist Chase Iron Eyes. Morton County sheriff’s deputies can arrest people who won’t leave. Army Corps rangers who are in the area can’t make arrests, but they can write citations for various offenses including trespassing that carry a maximum punishment of a $5,000 fine or six months in jail, Corps Capt. Ryan Hignight said. More than 700 protest-related arrests have occurred since August, though activity has waned recently. While some in camp feel “under threat” by Wednesday’s deadline, most are focusing on moving off federal land and away from the flood plain, said Phyllis Young, one of the camp leaders. “The camps will continue,” she said. “Freedom is in our DNA, and we have no choice but to continue the struggle.” Other camps are popping up on private land in the area, including one the Cheyenne River Sioux has set up about a mile from the Oceti Sakowin camp. “A lot of our people want to be here and pray for our future,” tribal Chairman Harold Frazier said. Once the main camp is cleared of people, cleanup of trash and debris that’s being coordinated by the tribal, state and federal governments will continue. More than 1,000 tons of waste had been removed by contractors as of early Tuesday, though dozens of semi-permanent structures remained, according to Herr. Dozens of abandoned vehicles also remained, according to George Kuntz, vice president of the North Dakota Towing Association. Law enforcement for months has maintained a staging area just north of the protest camp. With cleanup continuing, construction ongoing and protesters still in the area, it’s unclear when the operations center will be shut down. “That will be a tactical decision,” said Mike Nowatzki, a spokesman for Gov. Burgum.
‘Palestinians reject Israel’s system of apartheid and racial discrimination’  [SEP]  The escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict isn’t religious, it’s about the rights of Palestinian people to be free from the longest occupation in modern history, says Mustafa Barghouti, the General Secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas suspended all ties with Israel on Friday after deadly clashes erupted between protesters and Israeli police. Protests broke out after Israeli authorities installed security cameras and metal detectors at the revered Al-Aqsa Mosque, Jerusalem’s most sensitive holy site. Temple Mount, or Haram esh-Sharif as it is known to Muslims, is one of the most contested religious sites in the world. For Jews, it is believed to have been the site of two biblical temples, the Al-Aqsa Mosque on the hill is Islam’s third holiest site. The Arab League has warned Israel about crossing “a red line” in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict over the sacred city of Jerusalem. Meanwhile, an Israeli minister said the metal detectors that triggered the violence will remain. The League’s foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting in Cairo on Wednesday. RT: Palestinian President Abbas suspended all relations with Israel. How would you comment on that? Are you surprised? Mustafa Barghouti: No, I am not, actually. He should have done that some time ago because the Israeli behavior is a behavior that wants to kill any possibility of peace in this place. Its policy is directed at destroying the two-state solution either by the measures they are taking at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is a very provocative act or by the law they have just passed which prohibits even negotiations over Jerusalem or by the increased settlement activities which have exceeded any previous expansion before. All these factors have led to this reaction. They have killed three of our people and injured no less than 432 demonstrators. All the people were just praying peacefully, I was there myself, and I saw myself – there was no violence from the Palestinian side and suddenly we were attacked with bullets, with the clubs, they were very aggressive toward the Palestinian prayers. RT: Surely Israel has the right to step up security given what has happened [two Israelis policemen were killed at the entrance to the Temple Mount in Jerusalem on July,14]? Can you understand Israel’s nervousness? MB: No, I think Netanyahu has heard his own security people advising him to take away these metal detectors and stop changing the status quo in the Al-Aqsa Mosque, but he didn’t listen to them. He proceeded by listening to the extreme ministers in his cabinet. The result is this explosion that we see. Not only in Jerusalem but all over the West Bank. You must understand this is not a religious conflict. This is about national rights; this is about the right of the Palestinian people to be free from occupation. To get their freedom after 50 years of occupation which is the longest occupation in modern history. This is about people rejecting to be treated as third class citizens; this is about rejecting a system of apartheid and racial discrimination that Israel has created. To people in Jerusalem and the rest of the Palestinian territories, people are saying “enough is enough, we cannot take it anymore, we want our freedom, we want our independence.” This is the essence of what is happening. ‘Palestine freezing contacts with Tel Aviv is right move amid constant Israeli provocations’ RT: What is your reaction to the move by Palestinian President Abbas to freeze all contacts with Israel? Miko Peled, peace activist: It is certainly the right move. Israeli provocations have led to these massive protests; this is definitely the right approach and the right move. We need also to remember Israel has been denying two million people in Gaza water and electricity in this terrible heat – people are dying of thirst and heat just a 45-minute drive away from Jerusalem. Israel has been engaged in serious provocations against the Palestinians. RT: What is your opinion about the Israeli argument that more security measures are needed? MP: The presence of the Israeli security forces in the old city of Jerusalem, around the Al Al-Aqsa Mosque are a constant provocation to the Palestinians and an infringement of the Palestinians’ right to practice their faith, to worship at the Al-Aqsa Mosque… And the provocation is not just an existence of this huge number of forces but also the way they behave, the way they treat the Palestinians, the way they arrest youth, the constant harassment as people try to get in and out of the old city, in and out of the holy sanctuary. So, to expect that there will be such oppression on the rights of Palestinians and there will be no violence in return is a little naïve. But we have to look at the fact that the main form of resistance has been in a form of civil disobedience with thousands of worshipers refusing to go through the metal detectors, standing outside the mosque and praying peacefully albeit standing under the weapons and the guns of the Israeli security forces…
SA paramedic killed in United Arab Emirates helicopter crash  [SEP]  Lindy-Lee Felix said in a post on Facebook on Sunday, “My biggest hero ... my brother ... Mark Gavin Roxburgh was killed in a tragic helicopter crash in … in the north-eastern region of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). “He died on a rescue mission ... a tragic awful accident that has taken him from us. My heart breaks with the families of the three others who lost their lives. I have no words to describe the heartache ... We are beyond broken.” Felix said she had taken to social media to honour her brother — a strong, courageous, selfless man. She said he had been a loving uncle, son and brother and a passionate father. “The world is less a hero, as God has taken him home. “My dear brother ... You have crossed the ultimate finishing line ... and you can now finally be at peace," she wrote. The Nation said that Roxburgh had been working in the Middle East for several years before moving to the UAE to join Abu Dhabi Aviation as a search-and-rescue winchman and paramedic. Abu Dhabi Aviation provided search-and-rescue support to the armed forces of the UAE, said The Nation. It was widely speculated that the helicopter had clipped the zipline but the RAK Tourism Development Authority said that had yet to be confirmed and would form part of an air crash investigation.
Alabama governor defiant as sex scandal trouble mounts  [SEP]  MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley simultaneously sued to block potential impeachment proceedings and apologized to voters Friday, assuring them he has done nothing illegal and vowing to stay in office in the face of a sex-tinged scandal. The governor’s defiance came at the end of particularly difficult week. Calls for Bentley’s resignation have grown, and he learned he could face criminal prosecution after the Alabama Ethics Commission found probable cause that he broke ethics and campaign law. “Let me say to the people of this state how sorry I am,” Bentley told reporters on the marble steps of the Capitol. He did not take questions. Moments before Bentley addressed the media, his office filed the lawsuit against the House Judiciary Committee seeking to block proceedings that include the release of a special counsel’s potentially embarrassing report in the ongoing impeachment investigation. A judge said during a hastily called hearing on the lawsuit that he wasn’t inclined to block the release, but it wasn’t clear exactly when it would be made public. In the court session, Bentley’s attorney asked Circuit Judge Roman Shaul to delay the public release of the report. Bentley, 74, has been engulfed in scandal since recordings surfaced in 2016 of him making suggestive remarks to a female aide before he and his wife of 50 years got divorced. The mild-mannered dermatologist and former Baptist deacon has acknowledged making personal mistakes but maintained he did nothing illegal or to merit his removal from office. The controversy erupted when the former head of state law enforcement, Spencer Collier, a day after being fired by Bentley, publicly accused Bentley of having an affair with his longtime political adviser, Rebekah Caldwell Mason. Collier said Mason wielded so much power that she was considered the “de facto governor.” In his statement, Bentley continued to deny any crimes and criticized unnamed people for “taking pleasure in shaming” him and his family. “The people of this state have never asked to be told of or shown the intimate, embarrassing details of my personal life and my personal struggles,” Bentley said. In the lawsuit, Bentley called the impeachment process “fundamentally unfair.” Bentley’s legal adviser David Byrne told the judge that the rapidly moving process hasn’t given the governor time to respond. “It has taken on an immediacy that we believe leaves due process in the dust,” Byrne said. He also said the impeachment articles accusing Bentley of corruption and neglect of duty are “extremely vague.” The special counsel to the Judiciary Committee, Jack Sharman, told the judge that the committee hadn’t violated any due process rights and court doesn’t have right to interfere with the Legislature’s hearing process. Legislative lawyer Othni Lathram, also representing the Judiciary Committee, said some lawmakers wanted to vote on impeachment immediately, and hearings were meant to provide Bentley with due process. He said the report is about 100 pages long with 3,000 pages of exhibits. Efforts to impeach Bentley have gathered steam for months, and the House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hold its first hearing on the matter Monday. Committee Chairman Mike Jones said Thursday that lawmakers should prepare for a long week. Earlier this week, the state Ethics Commission found probable cause that the Republican governor broke state ethics and campaign finance laws. The commission referred the case to a prosecutor, who will decide whether to seek criminal charges. Senate Pro Tem Del Marsh called on his fellow Republican to seriously considering stepping down. “I don’t think it does us any good to have the House go through these impeachment proceedings,” Marsh said Thursday. Rep. Ed Henry, the lawmaker who spearheaded the impeachment articles, added: “What I’m hearing is the report is going to be extremely embarrassing for us as a state.” Ross Garber, the lawyer representing Bentley in the impeachment investigation, has urged lawmakers to be cautious. Garber said that since 1929 only two governors have been removed by impeachment and both were under criminal indictment.
Venezuelans in Peru take up Maduro's offer to fly home  [SEP]  LIMA - Nearly 100 migrants on Monday took up an offer by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to fly them home from Lima, citing xenophobia against Venezuelans and difficulties in getting work. The move is part of the socialist government's "Return to the Homeland" scheme to counter a mass exodus and woo back young Venezuelans to work in the crisis-torn country. Ninety-seven migrants, including 22 children and four pregnant women, boarded a flight laid on by the state-run airline Conviasa for the five-hour flight back to Caracas. Forty-two-year-old Miguel Materano said was making the trip he could otherwise not afford, to escape "a bad situation here and xenophobia" towards Venezuelan migrants. "I'm going to look for a job. The government has promised that it will help us," Materano told AFP. Katiuska Anselmo said she could not find anyone to take care of her children as she sought work in Peru. Another returnee, Yusmari Arrais, said she was going back because she could not find a job while pregnant. The group were put up in a hotel near the Venezuelan embassy in Lima on Sunday, where they received food and medical care, a Venezuelan official told reporters at the airport. The flight comes as tens of thousands of migrants stream into Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil from the opposite direction, part of what officials say is one of the biggest population movements in recent South American history, driven by economic mismanagement and repression in once wealthy Venezuela. On Friday, Venezuela's communications Minister Jorge Rodriguez said migrants "are going to return" following reforms announced by Maduro last week to counter hyperinflation that the International Monetary Fund has forecast to surpass a million percent this year. Of the 2.3 million Venezuelans living abroad, more than 1.6 million have fled the country since the crisis began in 2015, according to UN figures. The pace of departures has accelerated in recent days. According to the UN, as many as 4,000 people have been arriving daily in Ecuador, Peru, Colombia and Brazil. But the massive exodus has overwhelmed Venezuela's neighbors, with outbreaks of xenophobia in Peru and Brazil where locals see basic services such as health and jobs being under threat from migrants. "I don't have the slightest doubt that this flight... is part of a political plan by led by Nicolas Maduro himself that seeks only to discredit the Venezuelan diaspora in Peru," Oscar Perez, who heads a group of Venezuelans in Lima, told AFP. Perez said the Venezuelan government will use the group for propaganda purposes. "We are going to see them all over the radio and television in the coming days, with Nicolas Maduro saying that in Peru they were treated badly."
5 dead in torrential flooding in Spain’s Mallorca island  [SEP]  MADRID (AP) — At least five people were confirmed dead and five more remained missing on Wednesday after torrential rainstorms caused flash flooding on the Spanish island of Mallorca, authorities said. Two of the victims were British nationals, said Antonia Bauza, the deputy mayor of Sant Llorenc, the town hardest hit by the downpours, which is about 60 kilometers (40 miles) east of Mallorca’s capital, Palma. Bauza told Cadena SER radio that two other victims were locals, including an elderly woman whose body was found in the basement of her house. The fifth victim was in the town of S’illot, an emergency services spokeswoman who was not authorized to be named in media reports told The Associated Press. Authorities said 80 soldiers and seven vehicles from the military’s emergency unit were dispatched to the area, joining on Wednesday more than 100 rescuers who had been working in the area overnight. At least three towns have closed schools and hundreds of people are being sheltered in sport facilities and a local hippodrome, authorities said. The Spanish weather agency reported some 22 centimeters (8 inches) of rainfall in four hours on Tuesday evening in parts of the island. The agency said more heavy rainfall is expected Wednesday in eastern parts of the Iberian peninsula. The government announced that Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who called news of the flooding “devastating” in a tweet, would be flying to the area later on Wednesday. This story has been corrected to fix the spelling of the town of Sant Llorenc.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrives in Pyongyang for nuclear talks  [SEP]  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in Pyongyang on Friday for talks with officials on North Korea’s denuclearisation, according to a pool report by reporters travelling with him. Pompeo landed in the North Korean capital after a brief stop in Japan. He met with Kim Yong Chol, a senior North Korean official who played a key role together with Pompeo in arranging a U.S.-North Korea summit in Singapore last month. The secretary aims to secure the remains of some 200 U.S. troops missing from the Korean War and initial agreement on the North’s nuclear facilities to be declared, U.S. officials told Reuters.
Up to 38 killed, dozens injured as twin blasts hit near Kabul parliament  [SEP]  Two explosions have rocked the Afghan capital of Kabul. Up to 38 people have been killed and 70 others injured, according to conflicting figures cited by media outlets. The first explosion was carried out by a suicide bomber, according to AP. It was quickly followed by a car bomb near the same area. Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi confirmed that there are casualties, but said the exact numbers are so far unclear. Meanwhile, an Afghan official cited by Press TV stated that 38 people had been killed. A health official cited by Reuters stated that 23 people had been killed and more than 20 others injured, while TOLO News reported that 27 had been killed and 70 wounded. The blasts were likely targeting an area which includes government and lawmakers' offices, according to Sediqqi. TOLO reported that the blasts were targeting a convoy of officials leaving parliament offices. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the group was responsible for the attacks. Earlier on Tuesday, a suicide bomber killed at least seven people in southern Helmand province, according to provincial police chief Gen. Agha Noor Kemtoz. He said the target of that attack was a guesthouse used by a provincial intelligence official. No one has claimed responsibility for the earlier attack, but the Taliban frequently uses suicide attacks and roadside bombs to target government officials and Afghan security forces.
Romanian president blasts PM's "secret" Israel trip  [SEP]  BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romania's president has slammed the country's prime minister for embarking on a visit to Israel without his authorization. Klaus Iohannis blasted the "absurd secrecy" surrounding the two-day visit of Premier Viorica Dancila to Israel. In Romania's division of power, it's the president who is in charge of foreign visits and any foreign trips by the premier have to be authorized by the president. The latest spat comes just a week after Iohannis said Dancila had overstepped the mark in saying Bucharest was ready to follow the U.S. and move the country's embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. Iohannis, a political rival, said he hadn't been informed, adding the decision lacked "a solid ... base."
Supreme Court justice in Brazil dies in plane crash  [SEP]  RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Teori Zavascki, one of the most respected judges in the country who had been overseeing a large part of major corruption investigation, has died in a plane crash, his son said Thursday. Francisco Prehn Zavascki wrote on his Facebook page that his family had been informed that his father had died in a plane crash outside of Paraty. “Dear friends, we have just received confirmation that my father has died. Thank you for all the strength,” the son wrote. A Supreme Court spokesman confirmed that Zavascki was on the plane’s passenger list but didn’t have more information. Globo news cited firefighters saying three of the four people aboard the plane had died.

Turkey talking to Russia on ceasefire, evacuation from Syria's Aleppo  [SEP]  ANKARA/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey is negotiating with Russia to open a corridor to evacuate Syrian rebel fighters and civilians from the remaining opposition-held districts of Aleppo, but no agreement has yet been reached, a senior Turkish official said. Rebel defences in Aleppo collapsed on Monday, leading to a broad advance by the Syrian army across more than half of the remaining insurgent pocket in the city and a retreat of opposition fighters to a few districts. "Efforts are still underway to open a corridor for the rebels and civilians in Aleppo, and evacuate them from the region. There has been no agreement on this issue yet," the Turkish official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. "Turkish and Russian officials are expected to meet in Turkey tomorrow and evaluate the situation. The meeting will put the issue of opening a corridor, as well as a ceasefire, on the table," the official said. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said a ceasefire was needed to allow civilians to be evacuated and Ankara would intensify talks in coming days with Russia and other countries, although he said they were already in constant contact. "We're seeing the most cruel form of savagery in Aleppo, and the regime and its supporters are responsible for this. The wounded are not being let out and people are dying of starvation," he told a news conference in Ankara. "However, we will continue our efforts. Even if everyone remains silent, we will not be silenced...We always come up with concrete proposals, but we saw that many countries were not sincere," Cavusoglu said. A fighter with an opposition group inside Aleppo confirmed that there were talks between Russia and Turkey but had little hope they would succeed. "They are talking and they are failing because Russia is not really offering anything," he said from inside Syria by phone. An official from the rebel Turkmen Sultan Murad brigade said there was little incentive for them to accept anything that had been discussed so far. "They keep coming back with the same unacceptable demands and present it as an offer. These are not real offers," said the official, based in the southern Turkish city of Gaziantep. Rebel factions did not want to leave Aleppo, he said.
Plainfield Library director hits the ground running | New Hampton Tribune and Nashua Reporter  [SEP]  Jane Juchems saw that the Plainfield Public Library was in need of a new director and thought, “Why not?” And she couldn’t be happier in her new career. Juchems retired four years ago as the human resources director at Wartburg College but was looking for a new challenge. “After retiring I started substitute teaching,” she said, “but never thought about becoming a library director.” Juchems, who has always had a passion for reading, started taking her grandchildren to the summer reading program at the Plainfield Library. “I saw that they were taking applications for the part-time position so I decided to apply,” she said, “and I couldn’t be have been happier when I found out I got the job.” — For more on this story, see the Aug. 24 Reporter
Film producer Harvey Weinstein indicted on rape charges  [SEP]  Movie producer Harvey Weinstein has been indicted on charges of rape and a criminal sexual act, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said in a statement on Wednesday. Weinstein's indictment by a grand jury follows his arrest and court appearance last Friday on charges related to two among the scores of women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, all of which he has denied. Weinstein's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said at the time the disgraced producer intends to plead not guilty. Earlier on Wednesday, Weinstein declined to testify before the grand jury after a judge denied a request by Brafman to postpone the appearance. Brafman had argued Weinstein was denied access to information about the case and lacked preparation time. The grand jury indictment follows a months-long investigation with the New York Police Department. Police have not identified the two women, but said the crimes took place in 2004 and 2013. Vance's statement said Weinstein was charged by the grand jury with rape in the first and third degrees and a criminal sexual act in the first degree. If convicted on the most serious charges, Weinstein could face between five and 25 years in prison. Weinstein, the 66-year-old co-founder of the Miramax film studio and the Weinstein Co, has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 70 women, with some of the allegations dating back decades. He has denied ever having nonconsensual sex. The accusations, first reported last year by the New York Times and the New Yorker, gave rise to the #MeToo movement, in which hundreds of women have publicly accused powerful men in business, government and entertainment of sexual misconduct.
New Zealand passes law banning sales of homes to most foreigners  [SEP]  NEW ZEALAND HAS passed legislation curbing foreigners’ ability to buy residential property in a bid to rein in the South Pacific nation’s booming housing prices. The law, which passed late yesterday, meets a key campaign pledge from Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who vowed to make housing more affordable before her election last year. The new restrictions mean an almost complete ban on non-nationals buying residential property in New Zealand, with only a couple of exemptions. “This is a significant milestone and demonstrates this government’s commitment to making the dream of homeownership a reality for more New Zealanders,” Associate Finance Minister David Parker said. He added that the change “ensures that the market for our homes is set in New Zealand, not on the international markets”. New Zealanders generally prefer to own their own homes, rather than rent, but record migration levels and a shortage of housing stock have driven up prices. A government report earlier this year found house prices had risen 30% in the past five years, outstripping income increases by two-to-one, rising to four-to-one in the country’s largest city Auckland. As a result, it said home ownership had slipped to a 60-year low. Ardern’s centre-left government says foreign buyers are a large part of the problem because they outbid locals. In the past, it has singled out Chinese buyers as a major driver in the Auckland market, sparking allegations of racism from critics. The new rules will prevent foreigners living in countries such as China, the main source of foreign buyers, from buying homes in New Zealand. However, Australians, the second most common foreign buyers, will be exempt due to free trade agreements, as will Singaporeans. New Zealand’s remoteness, once considered a hurdle for buyers, has also made it popular for ultra-rich foreigners looking for a bolthole. They include US tech titan Peter Thiel, director James Cameron, Russian steel magnate Alexander Abramov and US broadcaster Matt Lauer. Parker specified the new rules would apply “whether it’s a beautiful lakeside or oceanfront estate, or a modest suburban house”. Real Estate Institute of New Zealand chief executive Bindi Norwell questioned the need for the new rules, saying foreign buyers only made up a small portion of the market. “We don’t believe that banning foreign buyers from purchasing property in New Zealand is going to have any impact on house prices, nor will it help young people into their first homes,” she told stuff.co.nz.
Mediators call for dialogue as ETA disbands but Spain stands firm  [SEP]  CAMBO-LES-BAINS, France (Reuters) - Mediators called on Friday for talks to address remaining issues linked to the dissolution of separatist group ETA, including the status of prisoners, but Spain said it would not relent on jail conditions for convicted former militants. ETA declared its final dissolution this week, ending Western Europe’s last major armed campaign but leaving behind resentment after a 50-year drive for an independent Basque state that killed some 850 people. “We believe that building peace requires political dialogue among all the key actors. To resort to security measures and prison alone rarely proves successful,” said former British government aide Jonathan Powell, reading from a statement that was also delivered in the distinct Basque language, French, and Spanish. Gathered in Cambo-les-Bains, a town on the French side of the Basque Country, the mediators acknowledged the 305 former ETA members who are currently in jail in Spain and France. “Deep wounds remain. Families and communities are still divided,” said Powell, who was involved in the mediation. The status of the prisoners, some of whom are held in facilities hundreds of miles from their families, has become a bone of contention between Madrid and the Basque government. As the ceremony was underway, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Madrid would keep investigating the roughly 350 still-unsolved crimes attributed to ETA and sentences will continue to be served. “There has never been and there never will be any impunity,” Rajoy said in a televised speech. The head of the Basque regional government, Inigo Urkullu said this week that Rajoy had been receptive to moving prisoners closer to home, as ETA’s dissolution had always been the condition for changing policy. “It is a response to what most of Basque society has called for,” he told El Pais newspaper on Thursday. Rajoy’s minority government relies on the Basque National Party (PNV) to pass measures in parliament. But government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo said on Friday Madrid would not change its policy on prisoners. “It’s clear that the government won’t modify its penitentiary policy,” de Vigo said at a news conference when asked if Madrid could change its stance. Family members and other supporters of the prisoners have lobbied for years for prisoners to be moved, and for those who have fallen ill to be released. Neither Spain nor France sent a government representative to the meeting, which was attended by the former of the Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein Gerry Adams and Ireland’s former prime minister Bertie Aherne. Last month, ETA apologized to its victims and their relatives. About 850 people, including police, politicians and ordinary citizens, were killed in ETA bombings and shootings across Spain. ETA was formed in 1959 by students angry at the repressive dictatorship of General Francisco Franco but carried out its first known killing in 1968. Its campaign included political assassinations, most notably of Franco’s chosen successor, Luis Carrero Blanco in 1973. But as Spain returned to democracy after Franco’s death in 1975 and the Basque Country gained a large measure of autonomy, its attacks on the general populace, including a 1987 car bomb at a Barcelona supermarket which killed a pregnant woman and two children, horrified people and cost it support. Crackdowns by Spanish and French police also weakened it. Its demise comes as the Spanish government grapples with another separatist movement in the northeastern region of Catalonia. Although that is a non-violent campaign, it has brought on Spain’s most serious constitutional crisis in four decades and a government crackdown on its leaders.
‘All options are on the table’ after North Korean missile launch, Trump says  [SEP]  WASHINGTON, D.C. — President Donald Trump said “all options are on the table” after North Korea fired a ballistic missile over Japan in an especially aggressive test-flight that rattled an already anxious region. Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missile traveled about 1,677 miles and reached a maximum height of 341 miles as it flew over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, before plunging into the northern Pacific Ocean. “The world has received North Korea’s latest message loud and clear: this regime has signaled its contempt for its neighbors, for all members of the United Nations, and for minimum standards of acceptable international behavior. “Threatening and destabilizing actions only increase the North Korean regime’s isolation in the region and among all nations of the world. All options are on the table.”
At least 18 dead in China karaoke lounge fire  [SEP]  BEIJING: A fire tore through a karaoke lounge in southern China on Tuesday, killing 18 people and injuring another five in a suspected arson case, police and state media said. The blaze took place after midnight in a three-storey building in Qingyuan City, Guangdong province, and was put out shortly before 1:00 am local time, according to the police. A preliminary investigation found that the fire was caused by arson, the Qingyuan public security department said on its Weibo social media account. “The public security authorities are stepping up their investigation,” it said. The police statement did not describe the location of the fire but the official Xinhua news agency said it occurred in a KTV house, or karaoke lounge. Deadly fires are common in China, where safety regulations are widely flouted and enforcement is often lax. A blaze that killed 38 people at a nursing home in 2015 sparked soul-searching about safety standards in China. Courts jailed 21 people, including firefighters and government staff, over the fire last year. In the days following the accident, China’s top safety watchdog said the facility had poorly-designed fire exits, while safety checks, fire and electricity management, and the emergency response system were all found lacking. More than two dozen people were killed in two fires in Beijing’s migrant neighbourhoods late last year. The first blaze, which killed 19 people in November, prompted authorities to begin tearing down unsafe buildings in the capital, driving residents out in the middle of winter. – AFP
#IvanaTrump Shares Her Thoughts On Donald Jr's Divorce And A Trump 2nd Term  [SEP]  Ivana believes son Donald Trump Jr. will do better post-divorce than Vanessa Trump Ivana Trump, the first wife of Donald Trump, continues to weigh in on the Trump family business, not only concerning her children, but also about whether or not Donald Trump should seek a second term in the White House. Ivana Trump shares her own views and ex-husband Donald Trump’s views on the impending divorce of her oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and his estranged wife, Vanessa Trump. Ivana Trump Thinks One Term Is Enough For Donald Trump Ivana Trump says that she doesn’t want her former husband to run for a second term, says PageSix. Ivana believes that Donald Trump should play golf and enjoy his wealth. “I’ll tell you something, I don’t think it’s necessary. He has a good life and he has everything. Donald is going to be 74, 73 for the next [election] and maybe he should just go and play golf and enjoy his fortune. I think he probably [misses] a little bit of freedom, I don’t think he probably knew how much is involved of being the president. It’s so [much] information — you have to know the whole world.” Though Donald Trump has never confirmed this, Ivana Trump says that she gets in touch with Donald Trump at least once a month, and she claims that he frequently takes her advice. Ivana also has definite opinions on the divorce of her oldest son, Donald Trump Jr. and his estranged wife, Vanessa. Ivana confirms that she was the person who told Donald Trump that their son, a father of five, was getting divorced. “Of course, he was not happy.” Ivana Trump Thinks Vanessa Trump Might Struggle To Date With Kids Ivana says she is sad, but thinks Trump Jr. will be just fine. Vanessa, on the other hand, might struggle post-divorce because she has children. “Donald Jr. is a good-looking guy. He is successful. He is not going to have a problem to find a girl. Maybe Vanessa might have a little problem because she has five kids… who is going to date and marry the woman who has five children? Especially since she is young [40] and she might want to have more.” Ivana says she feels bad for Vanessa because she knows what it’s like to be cheated on. She says she didn’t know that Donald Trump was cheating on her, but she believes Vanessa knew about Aubrey O’Day the whole time. “It’s always distressing because I’ve been there. But who am I to judge and who knows what was the situation at that moment? It’s a long time ago now, so I think Vanessa knew it all along and maybe she just couldn’t get over the hurt to forgive him. But I honestly don’t know that many men who can keep their zippers up.” Friends Say That Vanessa Trump Will Be Fine Post-Divorce Friends of Vanessa Trump claim that Donald Jr. had numerous affairs, and not just with Aubrey O’Day. They also said that other issues had a part in ending the marriage, such as the tight grip Donald Jr. had on their finances. “There have been numerous affairs. This divorce has been in the works for a long time.” The divorce of Vanessa and Trump Jr. was said to be civil and uncontested, but recently filed documents indicate that there are still a few issues that need to be worked out with money and child custody. Vanessa’s friends say she will have financial freedom post-divorce due to her settlement and a recent influx of family money. “He treats her like a second-class citizen. He gives her very little help and has been keeping her on a tight budget. She doesn’t live a lavish life and can very rarely pick up a check at dinner.”
11 People Ill After Suspicious Letter Mailed to Fort Myer  [SEP]  The FBI is investigating a suspicious substance mailed to an Arlington, Virginia military base after 11 people, including several Marines, become ill on Tuesday. The letter was addressed to a commanding officer at the Joint Base Fort Myer-Henderson Hall and was opened in an administrative bloc, law enforcement officials told CNN. The sender has not been named. After the letter, which was described as irate, and at times unintelligible, was opened, several people reported experiencing a burning sensation on their hands and face, according to Specialist Nicholas Hodges who spoke to CNN. Local first responder and HAZMAT crews were called to the scene and three Marines were reportedly transported to a local hospital for additional treatment. The three are in a stable condition. Eight others complained of symptoms like nasal irritation and itching, according to ABC. “Base officials are coordinating with local HAZMAT teams and FBI. Several Marines are receiving medical care as a result of this incident. No additional details are available at this time as the investigation is ongoing,” Major Brian Block, a U.S. Marine Corps spokesperson said in a statement. Initial field tests found that no known toxic substances were linked to the letter, but the FBI is reportedly taking the contents to its Quantico lab for further analysis. Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall is an Army and Marine base near the Pentagon that is commonly-known as Fort Myer.
The First Brit: Human who lived around 10,000 years ago had 'dark to black' skin  [SEP]  Britain's oldest complete skeleton, known as Cheddar Man, was unearthed more than a century ago in Gough's Cave in Somerset. But an unprecedented examination of his DNA, along with a facial reconstruction of the fossil, shows that the young man would have had a darker complexion than previously thought, along with blue eyes and dark, curly hair. Previous reconstructions of Cheddar Man, which were not based on DNA data, depicted him with a lighter skin tone. Yet research by evolution and DNA specialists at the Natural History Museum and UCL suggests that the pigmentation associated with northern European ancestry is a more recent development. The research and remodelling process was documented for Channel 4 show The First Brit: Secrets of the 10,000 Year Old Man. Professor Ian Barnes, research leader at the Natural History Museum, said at a screening of the documentary: "For me, it's not just the skin colour that's interesting, it's that combination of features that make him look not like anyone that you'd see today. "Not just dark skin and blue eyes, because you can get that combination, but also the face shape. So all of this combines together and make him just not the same as people you see around today." Researchers Professor Barnes and Dr Selina Brace extracted DNA data from bone powder by drilling a 2mm hole through the skull's inner ear bone. They scanned the skull and a 3D model was produced by "paleo artists" Alfons and Adrie Kennis, who make life-like reconstructions of extinct mammals and early humans. The twins, who have created reconstructions for museums around the world and usually create models of Neanderthals, spent three months creating Cheddar Man. "It's really nice to make a more graceful man, not a heavy-browed Neanderthal. So we were very excited that it was a guy from after the Ice Age. We were very interested in what kind of human he was," said Alfons. "With the new DNA information it was really revolutionary. And it allowed us to look more at race, this revealed stuff that we'd never had known before." Cheddar Man, thought to have died in his twenties and have had a relatively good diet, lived in Britain when it was almost completely depopulated. Although previous populations had settled in Britain long before his arrival, they were wiped out before him and he marked the start of continuous habitation on the island. Genetically, he belonged to a group of people known as the "Western Hunter-Gatherers", Mesolithic-era individuals from Spain, Hungary and Luxembourg. His ancestors migrated to Europe from the Middle East after the Ice Age and today, 10% of White British people are descended from the group.
Budapest drops its bid for 2024 Olympic Games  [SEP]  And then there were two. Budapest has abandoned its bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics, a move that leaves Los Angeles and Paris as the only potential host cities. The decision was confirmed by a Budapest 2024 bid official, who said Hungary's capital city was pulling out because of a lack of political support for the project. Activists had collected hundreds of thousands of signatures from Hungarians who did not want to host the event. There's one big reason support drained away: the high cost of hosting the Olympics. "Many people are afraid that the cost would be immeasurable," Miklós Hajnal, one of the petition's organizers, told local media. Budget concerns have led city after city to abandon their Olympic dreams in recent years. Rome and Hamburg, Germany, previously bailed on 2024. Stockholm and Krakow, Poland, pulled the plug on bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics, which were later awarded to Beijing. An Olympic host city has to plan, pay for and construct massive sporting venues and infrastructure projects. Security costs can run into the billions of dollars. Thousands of hotel rooms must be built for athletes and tourists. Most of it happens on the taxpayer dime -- with little discernible economic benefit. Researchers at Oxford's Saïd Business School estimate the cost overrun for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro was $1.6 billion. Elected leaders have argued that ticket sales, construction jobs and increased tourism outweigh the costs. But economists say the real return on hosting the Olympics is not so rosy. Montreal, host city of the 1976 Summer Games, provides perhaps the best example of the long-term cost. Before the games, the mayor declared: "The Olympics can no more lose money than a man can have a baby." He was wrong. Gross cost overruns left the city with $1.5 billion of debt that wasn't paid off until 2006. The Olympic stadium, known as the Big O, was turned into a ballpark and now sits largely idle. The citizens of Montreal took to calling it the Big Owe. While Montreal is an extreme case, the Oxford researchers have found that spiraling costs are the norm. "All Games, without exception, have cost overrun," they wrote in a 2016 paper. "The budget is more like a fictitious minimum that is consistently overspent." The Montreal experience scared off potential host cities for 1984. Only one, Los Angeles, made a bid, and consequently was able to dictate terms to the International Olympic Committee. It pursued a new model that relied heavily on private financing. Los Angeles also used existing stadiums as venues, erasing one of the largest costs associated with hosting the Olympics. The result? A profit. Recent host cities have taken a different approach. Russia is said to have spent an incredible $50 billion on the 2014 Sochi Olympics. China spared no expense in hosting the 2008 Beijing Games. In Rio, the most recent summer event host, venues built for the Games have already fallen into disrepair. The International Olympic Committee knows it has a problem: The group is pursuing a set of reforms aimed at reducing the costs of bidding for and managing the Games.
Ukraine achieves approval to split from Russian Orthodox church  [SEP]  Ukraine secured approval on Thursday to establish an independent church in what Kiev says is a vital step against Russian meddling in its affairs, but the Russian clergy fiercely opposes the biggest split in Christianity for a thousand years. At a three-day synod presided over by the Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul, seat of the global spiritual leader of roughly 300 million Orthodox Christians, endorsed Ukraine's request for an 'autocephalous' (independent) church. The synod will 'proceed to the granting of Autocephaly to the Church of Ukraine,' a statement said. The synod took several decisions to pave the way for Ukraine to set up its church, including rehabilitating a Ukrainian patriarch excommunicated by the Russian Orthodox Church for leading a breakaway church in the early 1990s. In retaliation, the Russian Orthodox Church said it would break eucharistical relations with the Ecumenical Patriarchate, Interfax news agency quoted a spokesman as saying. The tussle over Ukraine's spiritual future flows from the poisoning of relations between Kiev and Moscow after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the outbreak of separatist fighting in Ukraine's east that has killed over 10,000 people. Ukraine accuses the Russian Orthodox Church of wielding a pernicious influence on its soil, allowing itself to be used as a tool of the Kremlin to justify Russian expansionism and support of separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine's victory on the church issue could bolster pro-Western President Petro Poroshenko's campaign in what is expected to be a tight election race next year. 'The decisions of the Ecumenical Patriarch and Synod finally dispelled the imperial illusions and chauvinistic fantasies of Moscow,' Poroshenko said. 'It is a question of our independence, national security, statehood, a question of world geopolitics.' The Russian Orthodox Church has compared Ukraine's moves for independence to the Great Schism of 1054 that split western and eastern Christianity, and warned they could lead to an irreversible rupture in the global Orthodox community. On Thursday, its spokesman said Istanbul had 'crossed a red line' by reversing the excommunication of Patriarch Filaret. Filaret hopes to lead the independent church. The Kremlin also voiced its displeasure, saying it opposed anything leading to a split in the Orthodox faith. Filaret told reporters that Thursday's decision paved the way for Ukraine to merge its three main Orthodox church branches into the new independent entity. Ukraine and Russia trace their Orthodox Christian roots to Volodymyr the Great, the prince whose baptism in 988 in Kiev led to the christianisation of the region known as the 'Kievan Rus'. The church known as the Moscow Patriarchate, which is aligned with the Russian Orthodox Church, earlier dominated in Ukraine but has been challenged by a rival known as the Kiev Patriarchate formed after the 1991 break-up of the Russian-dominated Soviet Union. Led by Filaret, the Kiev Patriarchate has championed an independent Ukrainian church and Ukraine's closer integration with the West. He is an outspoken critic of Russia's political leadership, charging that Vladimir Putin is possessed by Satan. The Moscow Patriarchate denies its church is a security threat to Ukraine and, far from being a Kremlin stooge, says it has done much to promote peace in the country's east. The Russian Orthodox Church has attacked Ukraine's bid for independence as a gambit by Poroshenko to shore up his flagging popularity. It calls the Kiev Patriarchate illegitimate and its spokesman warned that the split would lead to a 'tragic and possibly irretrievable schism of the whole Orthodoxy'. In retaliation for the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew's support for Ukraine, the Russian Orthodox Church decided last month to stop participating in structures chaired by the patriarch and would no longer commemorate him in his services. It has threatened to go one step further by no longer recognizing him as the first among equals in the Orthodox world. Asked about Russian warnings that the church split could lead to violence in Ukraine, Kurt Volker, Washington's ambassador to the Ukraine conflict, said on Thursday: 'I hope there are not protests and violence orchestrated as a result of this decision. I think it would be tragic to see that.'
Russia expels 23 British diplomats in retaliation for spy-poison case  [SEP]  Moscow: Russia ordered the expulsion of 23 British diplomats in retaliation for UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s ouster of 23 Kremlin envoys over the nerve-agent poisoning near London of a former spy and his daughter. The British consulate in St. Petersburg was also ordered to close and the British Council must stop its work in Russia, the Russian foreign ministry said in a website statement Saturday. UK Ambassador Laurie Bristow was summoned to the ministry and told the actions are “in response to the provocative actions of the British side and the unsubstantiated accusations” against Russia, the ministry said. The diplomats were given one week to leave Russia. “If further actions of an unfriendly nature are taken against Russia, the Russian side reserves the right to take other retaliatory measures,” the ministry said. The action came after May ordered out the largest number of Russian diplomats from London in 30 years and broke off all high-level contacts on Wednesday. She accused Moscow of an “unlawful use of force” involving weapons-grade nerve agent that poisoned former Kremlin double-agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the city of Salisbury on 4 March. The pair remain in critical condition. The first use of a nerve agent on European soil since World War II is a direct challenge to the Western alliance, days before elections are almost certain to give Vladimir Putin a fourth term as president. US President Donald Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron later backed the UK in a joint statement with May and said there’s “no plausible alternative explanation” to Russian responsibility. Russia denies involvement and had warned for days that it would respond to the UK’s expulsion of 40% of its diplomats in London. Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov denouncing the British accusations as “absolutely rude, unsubstantiated and baseless.” Bloomberg
Spain's Rajoy testifies as witness in major graft trial  [SEP]  Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is standing Wednesday as a witness in a major trial of some 40 people accused of involvement in a kickbacks-for-contracts scheme that helped finance his ruling Popular Party. Rajoy is not accused of any wrongdoing, but the National Court has called for him to provide testimony as the party's vice secretary general until 2003, and secretary general until 2004, when the illegal scheme was allegedly still operating. Wednesday's hearing is the first time a Prime Minister appears in court while holding office since Spain transitioned to democracy four decades ago. The case centers on the dealings that Francisco Correa, a businessman arrested in 2009, made through a network of aides and companies to arrange free events for the Popular Party in exchange for public contracts.
Pyeongchang Winter Olympics Website Attacked During Opening Ceremony - Reports  [SEP]  The 2018 Winter Olympic Games officially kicked off with an opening ceremony taking place in South Korean city of Pyeongchang on Friday. Some visitors of the event were unable to print their tickets in advance as the attack forced the organizers to shut down the website of the Games to prevent further damage, the Yonhap news agency reported. READ MORE: Let the Games Begin: Pyeongchang Winter Olympics Start Prior to Opening Ceremony The website resumed its operation around 8:00 a.m. local time (23:00 GMT, Friday).
Florida’s Race For Governor Is In Recount Territory  [SEP]  As additional votes were tallied following the general election, DeSantis’ lead narrowed to 0.47 percent, according to the most recent unofficial election results from the Florida Division of Elections as of Thursday afternoon. Florida law mandates that races where unofficial results show a margin of 0.5 percent or less will be subject to a machine recount, ordered by Florida Secretary of State Ken Detzner. If the machine recount shows a margin of 0.25 percent or less, the ballots will be manually recounted. (A manual recount is done by hand and considers overvotes and undervotes rejected by the machine.) Detzner told county election officials on Nov. 8 to prepare for statewide recounts, according to The Tampa Bay Times. “The recounts will be nationally watched ... (we’re) under a microscope,” he said. At least two other races are also likely to be subject to a recount, including the Senate race between Gov. Rick Scott (R) and incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.). The margin of victory in that race has narrowed to 0.22 percent, which places it in manual recount territory. “I sincerely regret that I couldn’t bring it home for you, but I can guarantee you this: I’m not going anywhere,” he said during a tearful, 10 minute speech. “We’re going to fight.” But concession speeches are not legally binding. They are a courteous gesture to one’s opponent out of respect for the democratic process. Gillum could formally decline a recount, but his campaign doesn’t appear to be considering that option. “On Tuesday night, the Gillum for Governor campaign operated with the best information available about the number of outstanding ballots left to count,” said Johanna Cervone, the campaign’s communications director, in a statement. “Since that time, it has become clear there are many more uncounted ballots than was originally reported.” “Our campaign, along with our attorney Barry Richard, is monitoring the situation closely and is ready for any outcome, including a state-mandated recount,” she continued. “Mayor Gillum started his campaign for the people, and we are committed to ensuring every single vote in Florida is counted.” When additional ballots began narrowing DeSantis’ margin of victory on Nov. 7, Gillum tweeted: “I’m looking forward to seeing every vote counted.” The tweet included a link to an article about an unknown number of outstanding votes in Democratic-stronghold Broward County. Gillum became the first black major-party gubernatorial candidate in Florida’s history when he grabbed the Democratic nomination in August. And with that achievement, racism became the fulcrum of the election. Within hours after the primary, DeSantis told Florida voters not to “monkey this up” by electing Gillum. And then voters received two separate robocalls from a neo-Nazi group in Idaho where a man pretending to be Gillum speaks in a stereotypically exaggerated dialect over drums and jungle noises. DeSantis also made four appearances at events hosted by a white nationalist and did not return a campaign contribution from Steven Alembik, who called former President Barack Obama a “muslim n****r.”
Megachurch pastor resigns from Trump's evangelical council  [SEP]  Most of President Donald Trump's evangelical advisers have stood by him this week following much criticism over his response to violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia, even as several CEOs left business advisory councils and members of his Committee on the Arts and Humanities have announced they are leaving the panel. In a first for his evangelical advisory council, New York City megachurch pastor A.R. Bernard announced Friday that he had stepped down from the unofficial board of evangelical advisers to Trump. Bernard sat at the president's table on May 3, the night before the National Prayer Breakfast when Trump gathered several religious leaders to announce an executive order on religious freedom. Bernard's Brooklyn-based Christian Cultural Center, which claims 37,000 in membership, has been described by the New York Times as the largest evangelical church in New York City. He said he submitted a formal letter on Tuesday, the same day Trump made controversial remarks about the events that took place in Charlottesville. During a news conference, while he condemned white supremacists, Trump defended some "fine people" in Charlottesville and asked why the "alt-left" had not been criticized for violence. On Thursday, the president mourned the loss of "beautiful statues and monuments," referring to monuments to Confederate leaders. Bernard was part of Trump's advisory council during the campaign, but he told the Times last year that he had stepped away from that election role because he felt more like "window dressing" than a genuine adviser. The Times also reported that Bernard is a registered Republican, though he voted twice for Bill Clinton and twice for President Obama. Bernard has been part of a group of a few dozen leaders who have given advice through the White House's liaison office. Other leaders who have been involved have been mostly a mix of Pentecostal and Southern Baptist pastors, including Robert Jeffress of First Baptist Dallas and Paula White of New Destiny Christian Center in Florida. Some leaders, including Southern Baptist pastor Jack Graham, Tony Suarez of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference and televangelist Mark Burns, doubled down in their support of the president. However, Chicago-area megachurch pastor James MacDonald reminded his followers that he resigned after the Access Hollywood tapes were published during Trump's campaign. MacDonald had called Trump "lecherous and worthless" in a letter to the rest of the council. Johnnie Moore, a former vice president of Liberty University, said in a text message that the group still plans to extend invitations to Bernard on various issues. "I am responsible for attempting to give them good advice if I have the opportunity to do so," he said. "I believe it would be immoral not to try and make a difference when and how I can." Earlier this week, Moore issued a statement saying evangelicals "abhor racism, anti-Semitism, white nationalism and white supremacism." "I do not know a single evangelical leader who is racist. I do know evangelicals who struggle to build bridges of understanding for various reasons," he said. "I also believe the way that some in the media and in the administration as well as other politicians and also activists ... [who] have handled the Charlottesville incident has at times been unhelpful, too emotional and insensitive." Several members of Trump's Committee on the Arts and Humanities said in a letter Friday that they were leaving the panel. A rising number of Americans wants Trump to resign a Public Religion Research Institute poll conducted in early August found, but white evangelicals remain most opposed to the idea. Among white evangelicals, 79 percent oppose the calls to impeach Trump compared with half of Americans who say Trump does not deserve to be impeached. Evangelicals, particularly white conservative ones, have debated their relationship to political power since the 1970s and 1980s, when Religious Right leaders tried to mobilize conservative Christians in politics. While 80 percent of evangelicals voted for Trump, many leaders became fiercely divided over whether to be so vocally supportive of the president. Leaders are especially split over how to respond to Trump's policies. Many of them see him as a vehicle to enact antiabortion policies and are especially pleased with his pick of Vice President Mike Pence and his nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. In a town just an hour southwest of Charlottesville, two evangelical brothers responded very differently from one another. On Sunday, Jonathan Falwell, who leads the megachurch Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Va., denounced racism from his pulpit. His brother Jerry Falwell Jr., who leads Liberty University, remained silent for several days until he tweeted support for Trump on Wednesday. The brothers' responses to Charlottesville reflect the larger divide in evangelicalism right now over how to respond to racially and politically charged issues. Several evangelical leaders spoke out against racism from their pulpits on Sunday, but fewer have directed criticism toward Trump specifically. One of the architects of the Religious Right, Jerry Falwell Sr., helped create Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Va., and its offshoot, Liberty University, institutions that were handed off to his sons Jerry Falwell Jr., who took the school, and Jonathan Falwell, who took the church. The two brothers seemed split during the election, with Jerry Falwell Jr. becoming one of Trump's earliest evangelical leaders to support him. Trump has spoken at Liberty several times, including this year's commencement ceremony. Franklin Graham, son of famed evangelist Billy Graham, defended Trump earlier this week. However, in a later post, he quoted Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who sharply condemned the violence by white racists. On Friday, he hinted his support for keeping Confederate monuments.
Donald Trump confirms CIA boss Mike Pompeo has met Kim Jong Un  [SEP]  President Donald Trump has confirmed that CIA director Mike Pompeo has met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The US president tweeted to confirm reports that a meeting had taken place. “Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed,” tweeted the president. “Details of Summit are being worked out now. Denuclearization will be a great thing for World, but also for North Korea!” Mr Trump, who has been hosting Japan’s prime minister Shinzo Abe at his Florida estate, earlier said five locations were under consideration for the meeting, which was scheduled to take place by early June. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Mr Trump and Mr Kim had not spoken directly. Mr Kim’s offer for a summit was initially conveyed to Mr Trump by South Korea last month, and the president shocked many by accepting it. US officials indicated over the past two weeks that North Korea’s government had communicated directly with Washington that it was ready to discuss its nuclear weapons programme. It would be the first summit between the US and North Korea during more than six decades of hostility since the Korean War. North Korea’s nuclear weapons and its capability to deliver them by ballistic missile pose a growing threat to the US mainland.
Interview with Richard Edelman, Edelman PR CEO, from the World Economic Forum 2018  [SEP]  Following are excerpts from a CNBC interview with Richard Edelman, CEO of Edelman, and CNBC's Akiko Fujita from the World Economic Forum 2018. AF: Welcome back to Cap Con. We are live here in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum, a very snowy Davos, we should say. The theme this year is creating a shared future in a fractured world. World and business leaders, all gathering here to tackle the issues of climate change, inequality, trade, all of the above. And we're joined by somebody who is a veteran here at Davos, Richard Edelman, who is the CEO and President of Edelman. It's great to have you on today. AF: You've just come out with a study, the Trust Barometer, which is something that you have every year, and one of the things that struck me is just how the US suffered the largest record drop in trust in the survey. What's behind that? RE: Well, it was led down by government. Government dropped 30 points for the opinion leaders, 14 points for the mass population. People don't have a sense of confidence in what's being said. Not just the policies. There's a, sort of, instability in a world without facts, and it's all opinion, and it's moving quite quickly, and it's disturbing people. AF: So, there's no question, it sounds like the Trump administration, at least, the rhetoric that has come out of it has-, has, at least according to this study, really hurt the US standing, the trust, as you point out. President Trump expected to come in here on Friday. How does he play to the group here at the World Economic Forum? It seems that the It seems that the America First policy runs a bit counter to what many of the global leaders here believe should be the policy, moving forward. RE: I think that America has to do more than just have an opinion. It has to lead. And I think what we've found in the data is a real hunger for knowledge and expertise. That a person like yourself is going down, that technical experts, academics, CEOs are going up. We want to have people we can trust giving us information. And it's also shocking that-, the decline of trust in search and social. That's driving all media down. Interestingly, a rise for journalists, like you, and a big jump for mainstream journalism. AF: Mm. So, a big jump for mainstream media, as you say, but the broader scope here, when you look at media, in general, there is a huge distrust there. How do you think people distinguish between what is on social, and what's on some of the bigger outlets? Is there a distinction there, in terms of what they trust? RE: 70% of people tell us that they can't distinguish between a real story and 'fake news', and they also believe that media is somewhat politicized, elitist. Half the people have now signed off of mainstream media altogether, so they're getting their news exclusively from search and social. RE: So, I think it's urgent for companies, and media companies, especially, to try to bring the discussion back to informing, as opposed to opining. AF: So, how do they do that? I mean, given that the general consumption of news right now isn't just through your traditional means, it is on social, it is online. How do mainstream outlets try to distinguish those two? RE: I believe that media's big job is to take on the responsibility for having the populace educated. And, in the moment, more than half the people say they can't judge whether a government official's doing well, or whether a brand is doing well, and that's a bad place to be. I think companies have to use their privileged position. Actually, 70% of people trust their own employer, so, talk first to your employees, let them talk broadly, but also, business has to not just have CEOs stand up, but take on issues of the future. For example, in the States, we're going to have 3 million truck drivers, with autonomous vehicles, they're not going to have a job. So, how are we going to retrain these people, so that they actually feel good, instead of having fears about immigration, or about lower social mobility, or about their future of their kids? AF: Mm. Let me bring the conversation back to your field, which is-, AF: Public relations, because, last year, we saw your biggest competitor, Bell Pottinger, fall, on the back of an epic scandal-, AF: And you have called for the PR industry to adopt new ethics principles. What does that guideline look like? RE: Well, basically, you shouldn't take every client. You should also have a style that recognizes your job as helping the media to find quality information. I think the whole PR industry, and I'm going to work like, hard on this, this year, should move from a position of advocacy and lobbying, towards one that is informing. Tell both sides of the story. Even if you're being paid by the company, your job is, oftentimes, to go direct to the end user of information, and, in the moment, silence is a tax on truth. And we've got to get companies to speak up, but speak up in a way that is educating, as opposed to just lobbying. AF: Okay, we'll have to leave it on that note. It's great to have you on, very early here-, AF: In Davos, Switzerland. Richard Edelman, there, joining us, from Edelman. We have-, we will have much more coverage from here in Switzerland that's coming up on the other side of the break.
The Leaders Putting Peru And Paddington Bear On The Eco-Tourism Map  [SEP]  With its spectacular mountain and rainforests, ancient cultural heritage and growing reputation for culinary superfoods, Peru is continuing to experience an eco-tourism boom. The nation expects 4.4m tourists to bring $5bn into its economy this year - 10% up on last year’s 4m visitors - according to the PromPeru exports and tourism promotion board. Yet widespread ecological destruction, economic hardship and guerrilla wars in the latter part of the 20th Century mean this is a comparatively recent phenomenon that required vision and leadership. “In the early 1970s, ecology was not much talked about in Peru,” says Jose Koechlin von Stein, who co-produced Werner Herzog’s classic films Aguirre, The Wrath of God and Fitzcarraldo in Peru in 1972 and 1982. In 1975, Koechlin set up Inkaterra, a company devoted to pioneering ecotourism and sustainable development in Peru. Starting with the Inkaterra Reserva Amazonica luxury lodge in the Peruvian rainforest, the company now also operates the Hacienda Concepcion and Inkaterra Guides Field Station. It has luxury eco-hotels in Cusco, the Machu Picchu cloud forest and Urubamba in Peru’s Sacred Valley, as well as a Machu Picchu hotel under the mid-priced “By Inkaterra” brand. Together, these employ 600 people and host 200,000-240,000 travellers a year. However, Inkaterra prefers to use other metrics to chart its success - species spotted, nurtured and preserved for mankind. In its 43 years, a total of 814 species of bird, 365 types of spider, 313 kinds of butterfly and more than 100 mammals have been painstakingly logged within its grounds. The discoveries have included 28 species new to science including 19 orchids, five amphibians, two bromeliads and a butterfly and tropical vine. Inkaterra’s Machu Picchu hotel also hosts 372 species of orchid, its own organic farm and a rescue center for the spectacled bears made famous by the Paddington books and films. “Everything is based on inventories,” says Koechlin. “Most hotels have them for beds, chairs and the tubes of shampoo in the shower. Ours are for flora, fauna and wildlife. “The first thing we do is learn about where the hotel is, undertaking environmental and cultural assessments so that we know what to compare ourselves against in the future and measure how our presence has improved the area. “People talk about sustainability but you have to know what it is that you want to sustain. “We never had any idea of how big ecotourism could become. The world has changed so much in the past 40 years that it would have been impossible to imagine the revolution that has happened. “But Peru is changing rapidly. There are now 30-40 lodges in the Peruvian rainforest. The challenge is to preserve as much as we can.” “Everything is different now,” agrees Marisol Mosquera, founder and president of Aracari, a Peru-based travel agency group which offers eight-day trips from London to Lima’s artistic Hotel B, the ancient city of Cusco, Sacred Valley, Urubamba and the 15thCentury Inca citadel of Machu Picchu. The trips are not cheap, at £3,245 ($4,260) per person but Mosquera says she has remained true to her original vision of pioneering high-quality experiential travel in Peru. In 1996, where she set up the business on returning to Peru from ten years working in financial services in New York and London, she says Peru was starting to recover from ten years of intense guerrilla warfare but was attracting few visitors outside the backpacker community. “Compounded by the economic crisis of the 70s, this meant there were no public investments in infrastructure for nearly three decades,” she recalls. A diaspora of talent in the 1970s and 1980s.made matters even worse. From the mid-1990s, a recovery got under way, however. A new airport opened in Lima in the late 1990s; infrastructure has been vastly improved and a plethora of new hotels have opened. A culinary revolution promoting Peruvian cuisine began around ten years ago, airline connectivity has improved and hotel standards have been revolutionized, according to Mosquera.. “When I scouted new locations in Peru between 1996 and 1999, I discarded 90% of the product I visited and checked” she says. “Now it’s the opposite. There is so much product out there and a lot of it is very good quality.” Mosquera is now planning expansion to offer tourism services in Bolivia. Sheremains optimistic about the prospects for Peru’s ecotourism but wants more Government and private sector investment in wildlife and flora preservation, prevention of logging and involvement of local communities. Koechlin believes this is vitally important too. Inkaterra’s latest project in development at Cabo Blanco on the Northern Peruvian coastline aims to protect marine and bird life and provide work for impoverished fishermen. It has located, acquired and refurbished a boat that Ernest Hemingway used for sport fishing and wants to use the location to promote and protect the local environment. “Whatever we may do for birdwatching in the area will be a means to growing our ecological research and understanding and providing jobs in conservation,” he says. “That is always our objective.”
Lula's Brazil presidential run in doubt after conviction upheld  [SEP]  PORTO ALEGRE, Brazil (Reuters) - A Brazilian appeals court unanimously upheld the corruption conviction of former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Wednesday and added to his sentence, a major blow to the popular politician’s plans to run again for the presidency this year. All three appellate court judges voted to uphold Lula’s convictions on taking bribes and money laundering. They also added 2 1/2 years to his sentence, condemning him to 12 years in prison. Lula, Brazil’s first working-class leader, so far remains free pending future appeals. Lula, 72, could now be ineligible to stand for election under Brazil’s “Ficha Limpa” or “Clean Record” law, which bans political candidates whose convictions have been upheld by an appellate court. However, an electoral court must make the final ruling on a candidacy, and would only do so once a candidate had registered. Lula can appeal Wednesday’s decision by the appeals court in Porto Alegre to higher courts to delay a final ruling, possibly avoiding jail and stringing the process out long enough to register his candidacy by the Aug. 15 deadline. Lula’s Workers Party called the ruling a “farce” orchestrated by Lula’s enemies to stop him returning to power. The party said it would resist the decision and push ahead with its plan to launch him as presidential candidate. A handful of supporters protested the court decision on Wednesday evening, setting fire to tires in downtown Porto Alegre and across a major highway in Sao Paulo, South America’s largest city. Opponents of Lula, meanwhile, celebrated on Sao Paulo’s main avenue with a giant blown-up figure of the ex-president dressed as a prison convict. Lula is one of scores of powerful politicians and businessmen caught up in sweeping corruption probes that have wracked the Brazilian establishment since 2014. His exclusion from the October election would radically alter the political landscape ahead of a campaign in which Lula is the early favorite, with 36 percent of voter preferences according to pollster Datafolha. That is double the percentage of his nearest rival, the far-right congressman and former army captain Jair Bolsonaro, who has been energized by anti-Lula sentiment. Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa stock index hit a new intraday high of 83,635 points on news of the unanimous ruling against Lula. It closed 3.32 percent higher on investor expectations his exclusion from the 2018 race will clear the way for a more market-friendly candidate who can stick to Brazil’s austerity agenda. Brazil’s currency, the real, firmed 3 percent against the U.S. dollar, leading gains in Latin America. “The ruling takes off the table the worst possible scenario for the market, the biggest downside possible in terms of the election,” said Roberto Campos, a partner at Sao Paulo-based Absolute Investimentos. “The guy who was completely not market-friendly is out.” Lula faces six more indictments in corruption cases ranging from receiving bribes from engineering firm Odebrecht [ODBES.UL] to obstructing justice and trafficking his influence to obtain government decisions favoring the auto industry. He is among over 100 people convicted in the “Car Wash” investigation, the most sprawling of Brazil’s numerous probes. It focuses on graft involving oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro, known as Petrobras , and other state-run companies. Speaking at a union rally on the outskirts of Sao Paulo on Wednesday, Lula told the crowd: “I committed no crime.” “The only fair decision today would be a 3-0 ruling that I was wrongly convicted and sentenced,” he said. Lula was convicted of corruption and money laundering last year for accepting a beachside apartment from an engineering firm vying for contracts with Petrobras. Prosecutors said the apartment and its refurbishing was a bribe worth 3.7 million reais ($1.1 million). Lula maintains he never owned the penthouse apartment, criticizing prosecutors for what Lula’s lawyers called a reliance on the plea bargain testimony of one witness, businessman Leo Pinheiro. “His word is not enough to incriminate Lula,” Lula’s lawyer Cristiano Zanin told the appeals court.
Tobacco giant BAT agrees £40.8bn takeover of US rival Reynolds « Guernsey Press  [SEP]  Dunhill and Lucky Strike firm British American Tobacco has agreed a 49.4 billion US dollar (£40.8 billion) takeover of US rival Reynolds in a deal creating the world's largest listed tobacco company. BAT, which currently owns 42.2% of Reynolds, will pay 59.64 US dollars (£49.27) per share for the remaining 57.8% of the company in an improved offer after originally tabling a 47 billion US dollar (£38.8 billion) approach in October. The deal will bring together a raft of global brands under one roof, including BAT products Rothmans, Kool and Kent, and Reynolds' brands such as Newport, Camel, Pall Mall, Doral, Misty and Capri slims. The offer comprises 25 billion US dollars (£20.6 billion) worth of BAT shares and 24.4 billion (£20.1 billion) US dollars in cash, valuing Reynolds at more than 85 billion US dollars (£70.2 million). The sweetened deal represents a 26% premium against the closing price of Reynolds' shares on October 20. BAT is expecting to make at least 400 million US dollars (£330 million) in cost savings after the two companies merge. C hief executive Nicandro Durante said: "Our combination with Reynolds will benefit from utilising the best talent from both organisations. "It will create a stronger, global tobacco and NGP (next generation products) business with direct access for our products across the most attractive markets in the world." The boards of both BAT and Reynolds will recommend the takeover to shareholders and have agreed a so-called break fee of up to 1 billion US dollars (£825 million) if either party pulls out or if the deal is blocked by regulators. If given the green light, it is expected to complete in the third quarter of the year. The agreement comes after Reynolds reportedly rejected BAT's initial offer in November. The companies' combined earnings will be significant. BAT reported £5 billion in operating profit in 2015, while Reynolds reported pre-tax profits of 6.4 billion US dollars (5.3 billion). The takeover is expected to help BAT gain a further foothold in the US, and give the new company a significant presence in high-growth markets including South America, the Middle East and Africa. BAT is also planning to use the increased might to expand further in the vaping and e-cigarette market - where it is already the largest international company outside the US - adding Reynolds' popular Vuse vapour brand. BAT has more than 200 brands sold in some 200 markets and employs over 50,000 staff worldwide. It claims to sell its cigarette brands to one in eight of the world's one billion smokers. Reynolds is the second biggest player in the US market, with three out of the four top- selling cigarette brands. The US firm has a 34% cigarette market share, with Newport the leading brand in menthol, Pall Mall the leading value brand and Natural American Spirit, the fastest growing premium brand. It has factories in North Carolina and Tennessee. BAT first invested in Reynolds through a deal which saw BAT's US subsidiary Brown & Williamson merge with RJ Reynolds in 2004, giving BAT its original 42% stake in the US firm. In 2014, BAT pumped 4.7 billion US dollars (£3.9 billion) into Reynolds in order to maintain its stake in the company following a mega-deal which saw Reynolds acquire sector peer Lorillard for 27.4 billion US dollars (£22.6 billion).
Silence around rampant opioid use 'deafening'  [SEP]  "What we find is that family structure, family support, those can play a huge role in recovery or even the way that addiction progresses within a family setting," she said. In Ontario, naloxone distribution and counselling are already offered through Punjabi Community Health Services in Brampton and Mississauga, said CEO Baldev Mutta. He said 90 per cent of their clients struggling with opioid addiction are Punjabi Sikhs and services are also available in Hindi, Gujarati and Malayalam, a language mostly spoken in the south of India. Families are offered counselling in every case at the organization, which last year had its annual budget doubled to $180,000 as the opioid epidemic spread, said Mutta, who is also a social worker. Opioid addiction is a big issue among men working in the trucking and taxi industries, he said. "They are city and long-haul truck drivers," Mutta said. "All these youngsters who are between the ages of 21 to about 30, they are into the trucking industry and that's where these drug dealers prey on them." Drivers are often offered $5,000 to make a round trip between the Toronto and Vancouver areas in four days, he said. "They say, 'All the truck drivers do it.' And they hook them on a mixture of heroin and crystal meth. You just don't fall asleep and then you crash after about four days and you don't wake up for two days," Mutta said. "They keep on driving long distances to make $5,000, only to realize that within six months they are spending more than $2,000 per month on their habit. So now you have not only a problem of taking heroin but in order to sustain your drug habit you become a drug dealer." Many of the drivers are enticed to make money so they can get settled in Canada as new immigrants but often find themselves facing drug charges without any knowledge of the legal implications, he said, adding families often to end up financially ruined. "Painkillers are becoming rampant because they are relatively cheap," he said of oxycodone as well as Tylenol 3s that are often mixed with a cola drink. Mutta said he regularly raises the issue of opioid abuse on Punjabi TV and radio programs, but said more community leaders must step up to create awareness about the crisis. "The silence is deafening in our community around it."
Eiffel Tower shut in dispute over ‘monstrous’ queues | Malay Mail  [SEP]  PARIS, Aug 1 — Staff at the Eiffel Tower shut down the Paris landmark this afternoon in protest over a new access policy which they say is generating “monstrous” queues for tourists. Access to the monument, which welcomed more than six million visitors last year, was blocked from 1400 GMT, according to a sign at the base of the tower. Staff had already been set to strike tomorrow. The site’s management said staff took action after talks with unions fell apart earlier this afternoon. The site was not evacuated, and tourists already inside were allowed to finish their visit. Staff are angry over a decision last month to start setting aside half of the Eiffel Tower’s daily tickets for people who buy them online in advance and choose a scheduled time for their visit. Previously just 20 per cent of tickets to go up the 324-metre (1,063-foot) “Iron Lady” could be booked ahead of time. The tower’s management has also started reserving specific elevators for each type of ticket holder, a move which “creates lines that are at times monstruous and often lopsided,” the CGT union said. During off-peak times for pre-booked tickets, such as the early afternoon, the reserved elevator might be half empty — despite lines of up to three hours at the elevator for walk-ins. And high demand at the pre-booked elevator can cause back-ups that force people to wait long beyond their scheduled visit. “Employees’ patience has run out,” the CGT’s Denis Vavassori said on Monday, adding that many visitors were unhappy with the long waits. Staff want all the elevators to be available to all visitors, no matter what kind of ticket they have bought. SETE, the company which runs the site, says it sells 10,000 online tickets for the tower every day and that “the waiting time is very short”. “For visitors who come without tickets, the waiting time at the checkouts at the foot of the Eiffel Tower is exactly the same as last year, while the number of visitors has increased,” it insisted. The tower has been hit by repeated strikes by its 300-strong staff in recent years over issues ranging from pick-pocketing to maintenance work. — AFP
Botched Measles Vaccines Killed 15 Young Children In South Sudan  [SEP]  JUBA, South Sudan — Fifteen young children have died in a botched measles vaccination campaign that saw people as young as 12 years old administering the vaccines, South Sudan's government announced Friday. The United Nations said the children died of "severe sepsis/toxicity'' from the contaminated vaccine, and the health ministry blamed the deaths on human error. One syringe was used for all the children during the four-day campaign, and the vaccine was stored without refrigeration the entire time. Measles is yet another challenge facing the desperately poor East African country that already has been devastated by more than three years of civil war and a recently declared famine, as well as a cholera outbreak. The government said all of the children who died were under the age of five. It is setting up a commission to determine who is responsible and whether victims' families will be compensated. South Africa's Minister of Health Dr Riek Gai Kok of South Sudan, right, and Dr.Abdulmuini Usman , World Health Organisation Country Representative, during a press conference in Juba, South Sudan, Friday, June 2. The measles vaccination campaign is targeting more than two million children across the country. About 300 children were targeted in the area where the children's deaths occurred. The children died in the rural town of Kapoeta in early May. Another 32 children suffered fever, vomiting and diarrhea but recovered, a joint statement by the World Health Organization and the U.N. children's agency UNICEF said. Abdulmumini Usman, the South Sudan country director for the World Health Organization, told The Associated Press earlier this week that even after the organization became aware of the deaths, the measles campaign continued across the country except in Kapoeta. "This campaign is lifesaving,'' Usman said. WHO provides some training to South Sudan's health officials and the U.N. children's agency provides the vaccines to the government. It was not immediately clear whether any U.N. officials were present at the time of the botched vaccinations. The joint statement by WHO and UNICEF said the vaccination team involved in the deaths was "neither qualified nor trained.'' It called the deaths a "tragic event.'' Dr. Samson Baba, an immunization official in the ministry of health, refused to comment on the deaths earlier this week, instead demanding the source of the information. A malnourished child sits on a bed May 30 at the clinic run by Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in Aweil, Northern Bahr al Ghazal, South Sudan. A measles vaccination campaign is targeting more than two million children across the country. South Sudan's government on Friday also said vaccinations are not being denied to any part of the country, including those held by opposition forces. The civil war has killed tens of thousands and sent more than 1.8 million people fleeing the country, creating the world's fastest-growing refugee crisis. In 2016, South Sudan had at least 2,294 measles cases and 28 people died, according to U.N. data. So far this year, at least one person has died and 665 people have been infected. Friday's U.N. statement said the risk of measles in the country remains "extremely high.''
1 killed in fire at Trump Tower in New York  [SEP]  NEW YORK (AP) — A raging fire that tore through a 50th-floor apartment at Trump Tower on Saturday killed a man inside and sent flames and thick, black smoke pouring from windows of the president’s namesake skyscraper. New York Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said the cause of the blaze is not yet known but the apartment was “virtually entirely on fire” when firefighters arrived after 5:30 p.m. “It was a very difficult fire, as you can imagine,” Nigro told reporters outside the building in midtown Manhattan. “The apartment is quite large.” Todd Brassner, 67, who was in the apartment, was taken to a hospital and died a short time later, the New York Police Department said. Property records obtained by The Associated Press indicate Brassner was an art dealer who had purchased his 50th-floor unit in 1996. Officials said four firefighters also suffered minor injuries. An investigation is ongoing. Shortly after news of the fire broke, Trump, who was in Washington, tweeted: “Fire at Trump Tower is out. Very confined (well built building). Firemen (and women) did a great job. THANK YOU!” Asked if that assessment was accurate, Nigro said, “It’s a well-built building. The upper floors, the residence floors, are not sprinklered.” Fire sprinklers were not required in New York City high-rises when Trump Tower was completed in 1983. Subsequent updates to the building code required commercial skyscrapers to install the sprinklers retroactively, but owners of older residential high-rises are not required to install sprinklers unless the building undergoes major renovations. Some fire-safety advocates pushed for a requirement that older apartment buildings be retrofitted with sprinklers when New York City passed a law requiring them in new residential highrises in 1999, but officials in the administration of then-mayor Rudy Giuliani said that would be too expensive. Nigro noted that no member of the Trump family was in the 664-foot tower Saturday. Trump’s family has an apartment on the top floors of the 58-story building, but he has spent little time in New York since taking office. The headquarters of the Trump Organization is on the 26th floor. Nigro said firefighters and Secret Service members checked on the condition of Trump’s apartment. About 200 firefighters and emergency medical service workers responded to the fire, he said. Some residents said they didn’t get any notification from building management to evacuate. Lalitha Masson, a 76-year-old resident, called it “a very, very terrifying experience.” Masson told The New York Times that she did not receive any announcement about leaving, and that when she called the front desk no one answered. “When I saw the television, I thought we were finished,” said Masson, who lives on the 36th floor with her husband, Narinder, who is 79 and has Parkinson’s disease. She said she started praying because she felt it was the end. “I called my oldest son and said goodbye to him because the way it looked everything was falling out of the window, and it reminded me of 9/11,” Masson said.
US Harrier jet crashes in East Africa  [SEP]  A United State Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier II jet crashed in Djibouti, in East Africa, on Tuesday, according to two defense officials. The pilot was able to eject and is currently being medically evaluated the officials added. The extent of the pilot's injuries are currently unknown. The United States has a large military presence in Djibouti based at Camp Lemonnier.
It’s vendetta, not accountability: Maryam Nawaz  [SEP]  ISLAMABAD: PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz, talking about the NAB references, on Saturday said it was vendetta, not accountability, and she would personally not like to be part of such process. In an interview in Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’ hosted by Talat Hussain, Maryam passed these remarks, saying the accountability process through which they had passed through during the last one and a half years showed grudge only. They were free to pass any judgment, she remarked. She was answering a question regarding the future line of action amid the NAB references and the stance that there had been a conspiracy against former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his family. Maryam said the Dawn Leaks issue was created to only pressurise Nawaz, adding that it was a ‘non-issue’. “The reality of the [Dawn Leaks] issue should have been revealed,” she said, adding that the truth should have been brought forward. She further said the Supreme Court’s verdict to disqualify her father from holding public office did not fulfil the requirements of justice. “The Supreme Court’s decision not only astonished the PML-N but the entire world,” she said. “We were not given the opportunity of a fair trial and the verdict did not fulfil the requirements of justice. The world is astonished over the verdict. When our judges, who are experts and understand the law, when they give such a verdict it will not only astonish the PML-N but also the entire world and questions will be raised,” she added. Maryam said that keeping in view the treatment meted out by the judiciary over the last year and a half, it was not possible to hope for justice yet “we decided to test the judicial system once again” by filing the review petitions against the Panama Papers case verdict. “With this in mind, we decided to once again test the judicial system of the country. We wanted to fulfil the legal requirements and the world should know that we approached the court repeatedly and tried repeatedly to have our voice heard. Now the result is in front of everyone,” she said. Maryam added that they were subjected to the worst media and judicial trial. “The people know everything and they’ve supported us throughout,” she said. “I believe there is no bigger injustice than what was done with us for the last one and a half years. We were subjected to the worst media and judicial trial. What happened during the JIT, I do not want to go into those details. We stayed within the system and fought for our rights and are now raising our voice for our rights.” Maryam also noted that the former prime minister “made several compromises in his four and a half years tenure which, in my opinion, he should not have done.” She said it would not be wrong to say the public had run the election campaign for PML-N in NA-120, insisting that Begum Kulsoom Nawaz would be represent the party actively in the assembly. The PML-N would give reply to the conspiracies hatched by the opponents by winning the NA-120 by-election with a huge margin, Maryam said. In response to a question about her own nomination for legislature, she said she would soon represent the party in the assembly. “The difference between the previous elections and this one is that 80 per cent of the supporters this time around are youth,” Maryam said, in response to a question about the election campaign. She made it clear that the name of Kulsoom Nawaz was not being considered for the prime minister’s office, adding that Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi was performing his duties in an excellent manner.
Chinese tech stocks slide following "clear signal" the trade war is escalating  [SEP]  • News emerged Wednesday that Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of the Chinese tech giant Huawei, was arrested in Canada on Saturday. • Beijing on Thursday demanded the US and China "clarify the reason for the detention" and immediately release the detainee. • The December 1 arrest is a "clear signal that the trade war is escalating to a new level," said Deutsche Bank Research. • A handful of Chinese tech stocks were underperforming the broader market. Chinese tech stocks were sliding Thursday after news emerged that Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of the Chinese smartphone giant Huawei was arrested in Canada at the request of US authorities. The Canadian Justice Department detained Meng in Vancouver on Saturday, and US officials want Canada to extradite her, the agency representative Ian McLeod told Business Insider. She will have a bail hearing on Friday, Mcleod said. Chinese Foreign Ministry on Thursday demanded the US and China "clarify the reason for the detention" and immediately release the detainee. While people are speculating Meng was charged for violating US sanctions on Iran, Huawei's spokesman Chase Skinner said in a statement that the company "has been provided very little information regarding the charges and is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms Meng," who is also the daughter of Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei. "Huawei complies with all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU," said Skinner. The December 1 arrest cast doubt on the trade truce between Washington and Beijing, who agreed over the weekend to pause tariff escalations for negotiations "We believe this is a clear signal that the trade war is escalating to a new level," said Zhiwei Zhang, Deutsche Bank's chief China economist. "Huawei has been widely recognized as one of the most successful technology companies in China. This news pushed policy makers in Beijing into an awkward position. Public opinion in China will likely become more negative in respect to the trade war, and potentially against US companies." As a result, a handful pf Chinese tech stocks are underperforming the broader market. Here's the scoreboard as of 12:37 P.M. ET:
Bermuda is first country to repeal same-sex marriage law  [SEP]  The British island territory of Bermuda has become the first country to legalise and then repeal same-sex marriage. Governor John Rankin approved a bill reversing the right, a speedy turnaround given a supreme court ruling had made same-sex marriage legal just last year. The legislation had been approved in December. An earlier referendum on the issue revealed a majority of voters on the Atlantic Ocean island opposed same-sex marriage. At a time when the legalisation of same-sex marriage is gathering steam around the world, Bermuda's decision has been heavily cirticised by LGBT campaigners. Back in Britain, an urgent question has been scheduled for later today in the House of Commons. Activists have also lobbied Boris Johnson, as foreign secretary, to intervene. As Bermuda is a self-governing British territory it requires the foreign secretary's assent for new legislation, although in practice that consent is never withheld. About half a dozen same-sex marriages had been conducted in the time between the court's ruling and the new legislation being approved. Those unions will still be recongised under the new law.
The Cajun Navy is real and they’re rescuing people in Houston  [SEP]  HOUSTON, TX — Perhaps you’ve seen the fraudulent photo of the “Cajun Navy” heading towards the flooding and destruction in the wake of Hurricane Harvey and the resulting rains. Well, that photo might be chronologically incorrect, but the Cajun Navy is real and they’re helping Harvey’s victims. The Cajun Navy is part of a volunteer group that head toward coastal disasters with boats and rescue equipment. Cajun Navy volunteer Joshua Lincoln recounts a rescue in Houston recently when they saw what they thought was debris. They quickly realized that what they were looking at was a person, an elderly woman, floating face down as the current swept her away. “Donnie jumped from the vessel (and) brought her up out of the water,” Cajun Navy volunteer Joshua Lincoln told CNN’s John Berman on “AC 360” Monday night. “Ricky was manning the boat. He jumped in immediately also. I was at the front of the boat, leaving us in a serious current with nobody manning the motor in the back,” Lincoln said, referring to his colleagues by their first names only. The New Orleans Times-Picayune identified them as Donnie Davenport and Ricky Berrigan. “So they quickly grabbed her, started to resuscitate her, and were able to get her to breathing slowly, and then we were able to control the boat. We got her back to safety, and that’s that.” The rescue of the Houston woman on Monday was one of several credited to volunteers from the Cajun Navy, a grassroots citizens’ organization that came together in the aftermath of another hurricane in another state more than a decade ago. In the devastation and deep water left by Hurricane Katrina, Louisianans took to their boats to help each other, and the Cajun Navy was born. Now, they are helping their Texas neighbors. A flotilla of some 20 boats, hauled on trucks and trailers, came to Houston over the weekend to join the rescue effort, according to Cajun Navy organizer Clyde Cain. “We started deploying people (Monday) morning at 3 a.m.,” Cain told CNN. “Our goal is to help people get out if they are trapped in their homes or apartments, get them to safety.” Later Monday, Cain told CNN’s Chris Cuomo that more boats had come from Louisiana after the initial group. “We have no idea how long it’s going to last (in Houston),” he said. The Cajun Navy has grown since it was organized in Louisiana in 2005 and now has thousands of followers on its Facebook page. The organization helps communities with storm preparations, rescues and food distribution. It has no official relationship with the US Navy. Facebook and the phone application Zello is how the group finds out about people in need and connects them with volunteers who can assist them, Cain said. And with Harvey, now a drenching tropical storm, heading toward Louisiana, there is the looming possibility the Cajun Navy might be needed back in its home state. Lincoln explained their presence in Houston in personal terms of getting help, then giving it in return. “In my life I’ve been through a lot of storms including Katrina,” he said. “Seeing how people in Texas responded and helped us in a disaster kind of tugged at my heart. My house was flooded and I lost all kinds of things during Katrina.” When he heard about the disastrous situation in Houston and the people desperate for aid and assistance, he decided, “I’m not going to work. I’m just going to head that way and meet up with somebody and do what I can do. That’s what every man in the Cajun Navy has done, (every) man and woman.” Lincoln said the elderly woman pulled from Houston’s waters was “doing fine” Monday night and was reunited with relatives. “We found three family members — the family members thought she was safe at a high ground, (at) a school. They were misinformed. A gentleman through the Cajun Navy in Baton Rouge was able to locate the relatives and have them get back over to her.”
Alleged killer enraged nation can’t name  [SEP]  Ms Millane vanished at the beginning of this month. Ms Millane vanished at the beginning of this month. ALMOST everyone in New Zealand is talking about the death for a vibrant young backpacker who mysteriously vanished the day before her 22nd birthday. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has now even made a national apology over the tragic loss of Grace Millane - a talented young artist from England's south west, who was soaking in the world on the second leg of her round-the-world trip when she was killed. However, one court decision, which means her alleged killer cannot be named has sparked fury. Police in New Zealand have been forced to issue a warning that they will crack down on any attempts to name the accused killer - a 26-year-old man she was last seen with - after he was granted interim suppression order in court yesterday. "We would like to remind the public that while we appreciate the public feeling around this case, it is an offence to breach a court order such as a name suppression, and this includes naming someone who has name suppression on social media," Detective Inspector Scott Beard told reporters yesterday. Ms Millane's body was found by police on the outskirts of Auckland on Sunday after she went missing in the city on December 1, less than two weeks after she landed in the capital, alone, less than two weeks before. She mysteriously vanished having been seen for the last time at a CityLife Hotel in Auckland with a "male companion" - who is understood to have been on a Tinder date. Court documents say the accused is a resident at the CityLife on Queen Street and is charged with killing the tourist between December 1 and 2 Disturbingly, it has emerged that, just 11 minutes before she was last seen alive, the alleged killer left a chilling comment on Ms Millane's Facebook profile picture, writing "beautiful very radiant" with an upside-down smiley face emoji. The comment has since been deleted. A woman who was supposed to have met up with the alleged killer via Tinder after talking to him for several months has spoken to media in New Zealand - saying she was too busy to meet him. "Obviously angels were watching over me," the unnamed woman told Stuff, adding that she thought she had been talking to a "decent guy". "At the time it was just legitimately all normal," she said. "The only weird thing I thought about him was that he asked me for feet photos and of me with my high heels on." Responding to the tragedy, Prime Minister Ardern held back the tears as she spoke of New Zealand's "collective shame". "From the Kiwis I have spoken to there is this overwhelming sense of hurt and shame that this has happened in our country, a place that prides itself on our hospitality … especially to those who are visiting our shores," she said. "On behalf of New Zealand, I want to apologise to Grace's family. Your daughter should have been safe here and she wasn't and I'm sorry for that." The government had offered its support to the Millane family, Ms Ardern said. "I cannot imagine the grief of her family and what they will be experiencing." Her sentiment echoed widespread shock among much of the public in New Zealand. Candlelight vigils were on Monday being planned around the country during the weekend the operators of the Sky Tower - the most distinctive building in Auckland's skyline - said it would be lit in white until Thursday night as a tribute. The Millane family were grateful and gave their blessing for the planned events, but would not be attending, police said in a statement. Tourism New Zealand, which described the death as "unimaginable", meanwhile said travellers would be left concerned about what is usually considered a safe destination. While killings by strangers are uncommon in New Zealand and the yearly number of homicides has been fewer than 50 since 2010, a number of women visiting the country have been killed in recent decades. Ms Millane's accused murderer appeared in Auckland District Court yesterday, where he was called a "scumbag" from the public gallery as he appeared wearing a blue boiler suit. According to the New Zealand Herald, Judge Evangelos Thomas started the hearing by addressing the family. "All of us hope that justice for Grace is fair and swift and ultimately brings you some peace," he said at the outset of the hearing," Judge Thomas said. "That will not be happening today. There will be no judgment today." The accused will return to a higher court next year. Police on Monday evening said a post-mortem had been carried out but declined to comment on the results. Their examination of dense bush where Ms Millane's body was found is ongoing and officers were still appealing for witnesses near the scene. It came after a major hunt for answers which brought her father David to New Zealand to help with the search. On Friday, he made an emotional public appeal for help in finding his daughter, who he described as a "lovely, outgoing, fun-loving, family-orientated daughter". Alarm bells started ringing when she stopped contacting family and friends - who she had been in touch with nearly daily until her disappearance. Responding to the tragic news, her heartbroken brother Declan Millane wrote out the lyrics to You Are My Sunshine, along with a series of pictures of them both. "You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are grey," he wrote. "You'll never know, dear, how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away."
British-led mission to clean-up space junk successfully launched  [SEP]  A British-led mission to solve the dangers of space junk orbiting the Earth has been successfully launched. The RemoveDEBRIS satellite is set to be deployed from the International Space Station and will carry a net for capturing space rubbish and a harpoon that can haul in larger objects. How can a harpoon stop junk in space? ITV News met the team behind the challenge of answering that question. Several solutions had been considered by the Airbus team, including a throw-net, clamping mechanisms, robotic arms before it was decided a tethered harpoon would be the best answer. Harpoons rely on three physical actions to ensure safe and clean grasping: a high-energy impact into the target, piercing the structure and then reeling it in. The aim is to pull the space junk out of orbit, meaning it would blow up and disintegrate. Nasa tracks more than 20,000 pieces of debris larger than a cricket ball orbiting the Earth at speeds of up to 17,500 mph. An estimated 500,000 pieces are the size of marble or larger. A collision between a space craft and an object even as small as a marble could be disastrous. The new venture coincides with the Chinese space station Tiangong-1 crashing back down to Earth and landing in the South Pacific on Monday morning. Professor Guglielmo Aglietti, director of the Surrey Space Centre at the University of Surrey, said: "It is important to remember that a few significant collisions have already happened. "We believe the technologies we will be demonstrating with RemoveDEBRIS could provide feasible answers to the space junk problem - answers that could be used on future space missions in the very near future."
Preview: Northwestern State at Arizona  [SEP]  Arizona has owned the advantage in a lot of areas over the years and depth this season has become another strength for the No. 10 Wildcats, who will likely showcase that element Sunday night against visiting Northwestern State. Arizona has nine players averaging 15 minutes or more through the first three games, compared to just seven in double digits each of the last two seasons. Gabe York has finally earned the opportunity to be a featured player for the Wildcats and he’s taking advantage, averaging a team-high 15.3 points after scoring a career-best 23 in Thursday’s 12-point victory against visiting Boise State. The 6-foot-3 senior shooting guard specializes in the 3-point shot and might be Arizona’s most accurate perimeter shooter since Steve Kerr made an NCAA record 57.3 percent of his attempts from long distance in 1988. He’s already off to a 9-for-17 start from beyond the arc and should get some good looks against a Northwestern State team that’s surrendering an average of 90 points a game in its three losses. The Demons suffered a significant personnel loss in their season opener when senior point guard Jalan West, who averaged 20 points and 7.7 assists last season and 19.4 and 6.4 as a sophomore, suffered a season-ending torn ACL. ABOUT NORTHWESTERN STATE (0-3): The Demons still have a talented scorer in junior shooting guard Zeek Woodley, who averaged a team-leading 22.2 points last season and 13.9 as a freshman while shooting 61.7 percent from the floor. He scored 22, 39 and 24 points in the three games this season, averaging 18 field goal attempts a game and shooting at a 53.7 clip. Northwestern State has just one true point guard on the roster, junior college transfer Ta‘jon Welcome, so Devonte Hall has been asked to fill that starting role and he went scoreless with six assists and three turnovers in 28 minutes during Thursday’s loss to Louisiana-Monroe. ABOUT ARIZONA (3-0): The Wildcats may have a point guard dilemma on the horizon as well, though not for lack of bodies at the position. Kadeem Allen has been starting at that spot, but Parker Jackson-Cartwright is a more prototypical point guard and flashed his own scoring punch in the win against Boise State, totaling 14 points on 5-for-6 shooting in 18 minutes. Getting better defensively needs to be a focal point for Arizona, however, and Allen seems better suited to shine on that end of the court. 1. Arizona has won 41 straight games at home, the nation’s longest streak. 2. Arizona F Ryan Anderson came into the Boise State game leading the Wildcats in scoring at 16.5 points, but shot 4-of-13 and scored eight points to fall behind York as the team leader. 3. Northwestern State typically rotates in five players at a time, barring foul trouble.
Ottawa analyzing Trans Mountain ruling; going ahead with pipeline purchase  [SEP]  VANCOUVER — Finance Minister Bill Morneau says the federal government is pushing ahead with its purchase of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion despite a court ruling overturning approval of the project. Morneau says an expanded pipeline to bring more Alberta oil to the B.C. coast for shipment overseas is critically important to Canada’s economy and is a good investment. He says Ottawa needs to make sure the project proceeds, but must also ensure it goes ahead in the right way. He says the government is reviewing the Federal Appeal Court ruling carefully, but the judgment is long and he doesn’t have a response yet. The court ruled the National Energy Board’s review of the project was flawed because it failed to consider impact on marine life. It also said the federal government failed in its duty to properly consult with First Nations before giving the project the go-ahead. Shortly after the ruling, Kinder Morgan Canada shareholders voted more than 99 per cent in favour of a sale.
U.S. provided intelligence for Iraq strike in Syria -Pentagon  [SEP]  WASHINGTON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - The United States provided intelligence to Iraq for air strikes it conducted inside Syria in retaliation for recent bomb attacks in Baghdad, the Pentagon said on Friday. Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abbadi said he had ordered the Iraqi air force to strike Islamic State positions inside Syria. "Yes we were aware, yes we supported it as well with information," Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis told reporters. "It is a good strike, it is a valid strike, it was a strike against ISIS targets," Davis said, using an acronym for Islamic State. (Reporting by Idrees Ali; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
Police, firemen search for cause of explosion in Japan's Sapporo  [SEP]  Police and fire officials on Monday were searching for the cause of a dramatic explosion in the northern Japanese city of Sapporo that collapsed a building and injured 42 people. [TOKYO] Police and fire officials on Monday were searching for the cause of a dramatic explosion in the northern Japanese city of Sapporo that collapsed a building and injured 42 people. Media reports said the Sunday night incident may have involved propane gas tanks in the building where the blast occurred. Sapporo police and fire officials said it was too early to say anything certain about the cause of the explosion. Video posted on social media showed flames shooting up into the sky and debris-strewn streets. "I heard a bang which sounded like thunder, and my condo was shaken," a man who lived nearby was quoted as saying by the Japan Times. One man suffered burns to his face but his life was not in danger, the police said. Most of the others were treated for superficial injuries. Kyodo news agency reported that fire inspectors two months ago found that most of the building's tenants lacked evacuation gear as well as devices to warn of electrical short circuits.
Trump's Cabinet continues to fill up with ultra-wealthy | News | Journal Gazette  [SEP]  When former President George W. Bush assembled his first Cabinet in 2001, news reports dubbed them a team of millionaires, and government watchdogs questioned whether they were out of touch with most Americans’ problems. Combined, that group had an inflation-adjusted net worth of about $250 million – which is roughly one-tenth the wealth of President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary alone. Trump is putting together what will be the wealthiest administration in modern American history. His announced nominees for top positions include several multimillionaires, an heir to a family megafortune and two Forbes-certified billionaires. Rumored candidates for other positions suggest that Trump could add more ultra-rich appointees soon. Many of the Trump appointees were born wealthy, attended elite schools and went on to amass even larger fortunes as adults. As a group, they have much more experience funding political candidates than they do running government agencies. Their collective wealth in many ways defies Trump’s populist campaign promises. Their business ties, particularly to Wall Street, have drawn rebukes from Democrats. But the group also amplifies Trump’s own campaign pitch: that Washington outsiders who know how to navigate and exploit a “rigged” system are best able to fix that system for the working class. “It fits into Trump’s message that he’s trying to do business in an unusual way, by bringing in these outsiders,” said Nicole Hemmer, an assistant professor in presidential studies at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center. But Trump and his team, she added, won’t be able to draw on the same sort of life struggles that President Barack Obama did, in crafting policy to lift poor and middle-class Americans. “They’re just not going to have any access to that” life experience, she said. “I guess it will be a test – does empathy actually matter?” Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary is industrialist Wilbur Ross, who has amassed a fortune of $2.5 billion through decades at the helm of Rothschild’s bankruptcy practice and his own investment firm, according to Forbes. Ross’ would-be deputy at the Commerce Department, Todd Ricketts, is the son of a billionaire and the co-owner of the Chicago Cubs. Steven Mnuchin, who Trump named to head the Treasury Department, is a former Goldman Sachs executive, hedge fund executive and Hollywood financier. Betsy DeVos, a Michigan billionaire who was nominated as Trump’s education secretary, is the daughter of Richard DeVos, the co-founder of Amway. Her family has a net worth of $5.1 billion, according to Forbes. Elaine Chao, the choice for transportation secretary, is the daughter of a shipping magnate. It is a group that has long spent big to influence politics. Mnuchin, Ross and DeVos each made hundreds of thousands of dollars of political contributions within the last two years, according to OpenSecrets.org. In Ross’ Manhattan office, next to a window overlooking Central Park, there is a table filled with pictures of himself with candidates to whom he has contributed, including John Boehner, Michael Bloomberg and Bill Clinton. On Wednesday, Democrats seized on Ross’ and Mnuchin’s Wall Street ties to accuse Trump of undermining his populist pitch. “I’m not shocked by this. It’s a billionaire president being surrounded by a billionaire and millionaire cabinet, with a billionaire agenda … to hurt the middle class,” said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. “The appointments suggest that he’s going to break his campaign promises.” In their first interviews Wednesday after being unveiled as Cabinet nominees, Mnuchin and Ross pitched their business experience as beneficial to the goals of boosting workers. “I think one of the good things about both Wilbur and I, we have actually been bankers,” Mnuchin told CNBC, adding, “We’ve been in the business of regional banking, and we understand what it means to make loans.” On the campaign trail, Trump pledged to lift up Americans who have seen their economic prospects dim with the loss of well-paying blue-collar jobs. And indeed, voters by and large ignored Trump’s own opulence, which never became the baggage that it did for the 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney. Still, the question now is whether public officials who come from such privileged backgrounds will favor policies that benefit the rich. “This isn’t a criticism or a conspiracy, … but it’s important to recognize that everyone’s perspective and policy and government is shaped by the kind of life you’ve lived,” said Nicholas Carnes, a political scientist at Duke University. “The research really says that when you put a bunch of millionaires in charge, you can expect public policy that helps millionaires at the expense of everybody else.” Future appointments could further increase the wealth of Trump’s Cabinet. Harold Hamm – a self-made oil industry executive who ranks 30th on the Forbes 400, a list of the wealthiest Americans, with a net worth of $16.7 billion – is on Trump’s shortlist for secretary of energy.
Suspect in custody after standoff at Los Angeles Trader Joe's; 1 woman killed  [SEP]  President Donald Trump tweeted that he was "Watching Los Angeles possible hostage situation very closely" and that Los Angeles police officers were working with federal law enforcement.
Gambia leader accuses West African bloc of declaring war  [SEP]  FILE PHOTO Gambia's President Yahya Jammeh attends the plenary session of the Africa-South America Summit on Margarita Island September 27, 2009. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins/File Photo BANJUL (Reuters) - Gambian leader Yahya Jammeh accused West African regional body ECOWAS of declaring war, after it said it was putting forces on alert in case he refused to step down at the end of his mandate this month. Jammeh, who has vowed to stay in power despite losing a Dec. 1 election to rival Adama Barrow, also promised to defend Gambia against any outside aggression, in a New Year’s speech broadcast on state TV. The veteran leader initially conceded defeat in the vote, then changed his mind days later - raising fears that regional powers might have to intervene to oust him. His mandate runs out on Jan. 19. Marcel de Souza, commission president for the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), said last week it had put standby forces on alert. In his speech, Jammeh decried “the resolution of ECOWAS on the current situation to implement the results of Dec 1, 2016 presidential election by whatever means possible,” apparently acknowledging again that the poll did not go in his favor. “It is in effect a declaration of war and an insult to our constitution,” he said. “Let me make it very clear that we are ready to defend this country against any aggression ... My government will never opt for such confrontation but defending our sovereignty is a sacred duty for all patriotic Gambians.” Barrow’s surprise victory and Jammeh’s initial decision to concede after 22 years in power was initially seen as a moment of hope on continent where autocratic leaders are becoming more entrenched. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has stepped in as an ECOWAS mediator to offer Jammeh an “honorable exit”, but Jammeh said the bloc could no longer fulfill that role. “ECOWAS has also disqualified (itself) to provide mediation services as a genuine mediator has to be neutral and impartial and win the trust and confidence of the parties to the conflict,” he said.
Ronaldo 3, Spain 3: Portugal star’s hat trick earns wild draw  [SEP]  Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat trick, capped by a dipping free kick in the 88th minute as Portugal and Spain played to a wild 3-3 draw in the Group B opener for both countries. Ronaldo scored twice in the first half, only to see Spain rally for a 3-2 lead after two goals in three minutes early in the second half. Nacho Fernandez put Spain in front with a weaving half-volley from outside the penalty area in the 58th that bounced off the inside of the far post and trickled into the net. Ronaldo had one more brilliant moment to come. Earning a free kick from about 20 yards out, Ronaldo’s shot got just high enough over the wall and dipped under the crossbar. Goalkeeper David De Gea never moved and the Iberian neighbors each earned a point. Ronaldo scored on a penalty kick he earned in the fourth minute and again just before halftime on a left-footed shot from the top of the penalty area that De Gea should have saved. Diego Costa scored twice for the Spaniards, including a 55th-minute tally off a beautiful set piece set up by Andres Iniesta’s chip to the end line and a Sergio Busquets header back into the middle of the penalty area. The draw capped a week of turmoil for Spain after the firing of coach Julen Lopetegui.
Police say 9 shot early Sunday in Ohio club, 2 critical  [SEP]  Anna Hoehn, her furry bunny-ears headband tilting a wee bit starboard, held tight to her woolly lamb basket Saturday as she ventured onto the lush green lawn of Stan Hywet Hall & Gardens with about 110 other toddlers.
How House of Fraser closure could be disastrous for city shopping  [SEP]  For the past 15 years, House of Fraser has been the main draw to get shoppers out of the Bullring and across to other shops in the city. It is Birmingham’s biggest and oldest department store, having been in the city for 128 years, dating back to the time it was called Rackhams. Cut off from the bright lights of Grand Central and Bullring, the traditional department store has been one of the reasons people make the effort to walk across to Corporation Street since Bullring launched in 2003. It encouraged shoppers to explore the wonderful independents surrounding in the nearby Great Western Arcade together with the burgeoning set of indies opening on Colmore Row. At nearly half a million square foot of space, this is the biggest House of Fraser outside of London. It has withstood the launch of John Lewis, Debenhams, Harvey Nichols and Selfridges in the city. So, what will happen to this side of town when House of Fraser Birmingham closes in early 2019? Martineau Place , the shopping centre opposite House of Fraser, used to be a hub of fashion shops and places to eat out, housing a large GAP , H&M , Claire’s Accessories and Pizza Hut . Today, it feels like an empty shell, with mainly cheap shops like Poundland , CEX , Deichmann and Bonmarche surrounding the outside. I worry about the future of this side of town, arguably the most beautiful part due to its leafy location backing onto Cathedral Square, better known as Pigeon Park. And what will happen to the huge building that houses the store? It could make an attractive office block, but Colmore Row is already packed out with those. Yet with such a vast space to fill, it is unlikely another major store will be taking this on in the current climate, which has left many major retailers struggling. In New Street, the huge BHS store was replaced by H&M and the Pavilions shopping centre in High Street is being taken over as the world's largest Primark so neither of these stores are likely to make a move to this end of the city centre. There is only so much retail to go around so the future of shopping in this part of the city doesn't look bright. And saying 'meet me at the back of Rackhams' will never have the same meaning again.
Heavy rains, landslides kill at least 57 in Bangladesh  [SEP]  Heavy rains, landslides kill at least 57 in Bangladesh Heavy monsoon rains have killed at least 57 people in southeast Bangladesh, most of them buried under landslides, authorities said Tuesday. Police warned that the death toll would likely rise as emergency workers reached remote parts of the affected area, where telephone and transport links had been cut. “The recovery work is still going on. The death toll could rise as many areas still remained cut off,” the head of the Department of Disaster Management Reaz Ahmed told AFP. Ahmed said disaster response teams had been deployed to the affected areas to reinforce recovery work. “We have not been able to reach many of the affected places. Once the rains are over, we’ll get a full picture of the damage and get the recovery work in full swing,” he said. Many of the victims were from tribal communities in the remote hill district of Rangamati, close to the Indian border, where 35 people were killed when mudslides buried their homes. “Some of them were sleeping in their houses on hillsides when the landslides occurred,” district police chief Sayed Tariqul Hasan told AFP. “We’ve evacuated some of the affected villagers to schools and other safe places.” Six were killed in the nearby district of Bandarban, among them three children — siblings who were buried by a landslide as they slept in their home. Another 16 of the casualties were in the neighbouring district of Chittagong, where at least 126 people were killed when a massive landslide buried a village a decade ago. – Evacuation orders – The latest disaster came weeks after Cyclone Mora smashed into Bangladesh’s southeast, killing at least eight people and damaging tens of thousands of homes. Heavy monsoon rains also pounded the capital Dhaka and the port city of Chittagong in the district of the same name, which experienced 222 millimetres of rain, disrupting traffic for hours. Among the victims were at least four soldiers who had been sent to clear roads in Rangamati district after an earlier landslide. Thousands of troops are stationed in Rangamati, where a tribal insurgency raged for two decades, and which still suffers sporadic violence. “The soldiers were sent to clear roads hit by landslide in Manikchhari town when they themselves buried by a second landslide,” armed forces spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Rashidul Hassan told AFP. “Our team is working here to clear the dirt. We’ll know the full extent of the damage and casualties after they complete the work.” Fearing further landslides, police in Chittagong ordered the evacuation of thousands of slum dwellers living at the base of hills. In Dhaka, where traffic was severely affected by heavy rain, a ferry sank in the river Buriganga on Monday evening with an estimated 100 passengers aboard, police said. There were reports of 10 people missing following the accident but a river police official told AFP all passengers had managed to swim ashore.

Brazilian judge orders border closed to Venezuelan immigrants  [SEP]  BRASILIA (Reuters) - A Brazilian judge has ordered the border crossing from Venezuela closed to Venezuelan immigrants fleeing their country’s economic and political turmoil but the border remained open on Monday pending an appeal by the federal government. Hundreds of Venezuelans continued to walk across into Brazil, a border official said. Federal judge Helder Barreto on Sunday ordered the border closed until the frontier state of Roraima can create “humanitarian” conditions to receive the massive and disorderly influx. But the injunction has not gone into effect yet pending an appeal by Brazilian government lawyers. Over the last three years, tens of thousands of Venezuelans have arrived in Roraima, overwhelming social services and causing a humanitarian crisis with families sleeping in the streets amid rising crime and prostitution. The state government on Thursday decreed Venezuelans seeking medical and other social services in Roraima would have to present a valid passport, which many of the refugees do not have. Barreto ruled that such a measure was “discriminatory” and countered Brazilian laws. He suspended a provision that would allow the deportation or expulsion of Venezuelan immigrants who committed illegal acts and ordered the vaccination of those admitted to Brazil. However, he ordered the suspension of the entry of Venezuelans into Roraima until the state can reach an equilibrium between the arrival of migrants and their exit to other parts of Brazil. Following recommendations by the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, the Brazilian Air Force in early May began airlifting Venezuelan immigrants from Roraima for resettlement in other cities of Brazil. To date, some 820 Venezuelans have been flown out of Boa Vista, the state capital, by the Air Force. But state officials say more than 500 Venezuelans cross into Brazil every day on average and many stay in Roraima because they cannot afford to move on. Brazil’s federal government has declined requests by Roraima’s governor to close the border. Solicitor General Grace Mendonça renewed an appeal to the Supreme Court on Monday to suspend the state decree restricting services for Venezuelans, saying it interfered with federal powers.
Media show range of emotions after Trump presser  [SEP]  Reporters waited in the lobby of Trump Tower on Tuesday for vague remarks from President Trump about infrastructure. White House aides tamped down expectations ahead of time: they said the president was not expected to take questions. The reporters and aides were both surprised by what came next. Trump said "both sides" were responsible for the violence in Charlottesville that left three people dead on Saturday, seemingly equating neo-Nazis with anti-racism activists. After the Q&A session, members of the media freely expressed shock, disappointment and sometimes outright disgust. An editorial in Wednesday's Washington Post was titled "The nation can only weep." The closest analogue to Tuesday was Oct. 8. That's the day the obscene "Access Hollywood" tape came out via a story on the Post's web site. Trump prevailed in the election one month later, in spite of all the shock and sadness about his comments on the tape. Some TV commentators tried to keep that in mind while reacting, at times emotionally and personally, to the president's remarks on Tuesday. At one point, while speaking to CNN's Anderson Cooper, Van Jones said, "I don't know what to say tonight... I'm just hurt." David Gergen said on Cooper's program that people increasingly feel like Trump is "posing a danger not just to his party but to the country. He's going to tear us apart." "I would say to all Americans: we've got a problem," presidential historian Michael Beschloss said on MSNBC. "We've got a president who sent a big message today to hate groups: I'm going to make it easier for you." A tweet by presidential biographer David Maraniss went viral, perhaps because it tapped into wishful thinking by liberals. It said: "The living former presidents -- Bushes, Carter, Clinton & Obama -- should make a joint statement calling on the racist Trump to resign." The hashtag #ImpeachTrump was the #1 trending topic on Twitter for several hours. Trump's unexpected Q&A was a media critique through and through. He argued with members of the press corps, assailed "dishonest" coverage, and threw in a "fake news" smear for good measure. A White House official told CNN's Jeff Zeleny that Trump had been fuming in closed-door meetings about what he saw as unfair media coverage, and it spilled out very publicly. Veteran White House reporter Mark Knoller of CBS tweeted afterward, "Have never seen as frenzied a Q&A session with a president. Or as high-decibel an exchange either." And some GOP pundits ripped up their talking points. The White House's nightly "communications briefing" for media outlets quickly leaked out, partly because some of the recipients thought it was ridiculous. (The first bullet point about Charlottesville said "the president is entirely correct.") Related: 'All manner of stupid came out': Late night responds to Trump's press conference Even before those talking points came out, former Republican National Committee communications director Doug Heye, now a CNN commentator, tweeted: "I've asked the press offices at both the White House & RNC to remove me from their email lists." Conservative commentator Scott Jennings offered an impassioned plea to Trump on CNN. "Mr. President," he said, "we want to be with you in policy. But you are making it impossible for us to be with you in spirit." None of the broadcast networks televised Trump's Q&A live, because it wasn't expected to be groundbreaking. But after it happened, the broadcasters scrambled to produce special editions of their nightly newscasts. The "CBS Evening News" devoted its entire half hour to all things Trump and Charlottesville. The other newscasts squeezed in some other stories, but still focused squarely on the Q&A and the sweeping criticism that followed. "Remember," correspondent Hallie Jackson said on "NBC Nightly News," "he came down to the lobby in the first place to talk about infrastructure."
Kim Jong Un invites President Trump to meet  [SEP]  WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Donald Trump told reporters Thursday that South Korea will make a "major announcement" concerning North Korea at 7 p.m. ET. On Thursday a South Korean delegation came to the White House to brief officials on its most recent talks with North Korea -- the most significant talks between the two countries in more than a decade. The South Korean officials visiting the White House on Thursday talked to Trump, a person familiar with the matter said. They delivered a letter from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to Trump inviting him to meet, according to a senior US official and a former US senior official. The senior US official said North Korea has offered to suspend their nuclear missile testing alongside their invitation for talks. The official also said there are no plans to suspend the upcoming planned military exercises with South Korea. It's not clear if the South Koreans spoke to the President before or after his surprise pop-in to the White House briefing room. The leader of the South Korean delegation, Chung Eui-yong, will make the announcement from the stakeout position outside the West Wing, according to White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. He will be flanked by rest of the South Korean delegation. National Security Adviser Lt. General H.R. McMaster will brief the UN Security Council on Monday regarding the situation in North Korea and the talks with the South Korean delegation, according to a senior US official. Trump has expressed an openness to dialogue with North Korea, but the Trump administration has said North Korea must first take concrete steps toward denuclearization. "All options are on the table and our posture toward the regime will not change until we see credible moves toward denuclearization," a senior administration official told reporters on Tuesday. "What we are looking for is concrete steps toward denuclearization." Trump's approach to North Korea has wavered between bellicose rhetoric and expressions of openness to diplomacy -- with the President saying the US would rain "fire and fury" on North Korea one day and then saying he would consider speaking directly with the country's leader, Kim Jong Un, under the right circumstances. Amid the potentially breakthrough talks between North and South Korea, the Trump administration has also credited its campaign of "maximum pressure" on North Korea as having brought Pyongyang to the negotiating table. Since Trump came in to office, the US has leveled some of its most significant and far-reaching sanctions against North Korea and has also succeeded in pressuring China to further isolate the regime.
Lord Hague says government should 'be bold' and legalise cannabis  [SEP]  Former Conservative leader Lord Hague has called upon the government to "be bold" and follow Canada in legalising cannabis for recreational use. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, he said the eventual approval by the Home Office for medicinal cannabis oil to be used to treat epileptic youngster Billy Caldwell was evidence that a hard-line stance on the drug had become "inappropriate, ineffective and utterly out of date". The 12-year-old was made to wait almost a week before being allowed to use the drug his mother had brought home from Canada after it was confiscated by border officials at Heathrow Airport. An expert panel of clinicians is to be set up to advise the government on applications to prescribe cannabis-based medications in the wake of the case, but Lord Hague has suggested an even more liberal position be taken. "It's time to acknowledge facts, and to embrace a decisive change that would be economically and socially beneficial, as well as rather liberating for Conservatives in showing sensible new opinions are welcome," he wrote. "Can British Conservatives be as bold as Canadian Liberals? We ought to be." It was revealed back in April that Canada was set to legalise cannabis for recreational use by July next year, making it the first G7 industrialised nation to do so nationwide. In the US, it is only allowed in the states of Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada. Other countries, including Australia, Germany and Norway, only allow it to be used for medicinal purposes, while in many parts of the world it is entirely illegal. In the UK - which is the world's largest exporter of legal cannabis - it is a Class B drug and those found in possession face up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine, or both, with supply and production resulting in up to 14 years in prison and an unlimited fine. Lord Hague said "any war" to prevent use of the drug in the UK had been "irreversibly lost", and that the idea it could be "driven off the streets" was "nothing short of deluded". "When a law has ceased to be credible and worth enforcing to many police as well as the public, respect for the law in general is damaged," he wrote. "We should have laws we believe in and enforce or we should just get rid of them." He said the only beneficiaries of the current stance were "organised crime gangs" involved in a "multi-billion pound black market" for the drug. "It is absolutely unacceptable to allow this situation to continue - a major change in policy is necessary," he said.
Defending Europe? Mediterranean mayhem as group prepares to block migrants from Libya  [SEP]  Generation Identitaire plans to stop boats carrying migrants who have been rescued at sea to the European Union shores where they will try to seek asylum. Charities and NGOs are currently rescuing lives off the coast of Libya as thousands escape the war-torn country every day. Those leaving Libya are often not Libyan but from poorer nations in Africa, which they left to seek work elsewhere. However, since the fall of Gaddafi in Libya and the rise of militia groups, most have been raped, beaten, jailed and sold on black slave markets. Young, political representatives of Generation Identitaire - many of whom are not European but from the US and Canada - have claimed they are “defending Europe”. On Sunday the group announced their ship the C-Star will be boarded by their crew this week. They said: “The C-Star is on her way and tomorrow the first members of our Crew will arrive in Catania.” Brittany Pettibone announced on her Twitter site: “I have arrived in gorgeous Catania, Sicily for the Defend Europe mission… It’s gonna be kicking off pretty soon. “I am very excited to see what the next couple of weeks bring.” The group has been backed by people across Europe who want to seal borders to desperate souls from Africa and the Middle East - raising $100,000 to fund their boat. The vessel will have a crew of 15 and will allegedly try to stop boats entering Sicily - but will not stop the rescue missions for the time being. NGOs have said they will be breaking maritime laws which state there is a responsibility on the seafaring community to save all lives at sea. And those working on the seven ships from all over Europe, currently rescuing children, some just hours old, as well as their families, said the GI mission could lead to deaths. One anonymous NGO worker told Express.co.uk: “You call them economic migrants - and yes some of them are - but what you need to understand is while they are seeking work - they are doing so because they will die without it, and their families will too. “So, call them economic migrants, they are in technicality, but understand they may as well be coming from war zones because the outcome is the same, they are all facing death. “Wouldn’t you want to try and survive?” This year alone 2,000 people have died making the perilous crossing from Libya to Italy - a journey which they have each paid around $2,000 for. Many are escaping the worst kinds of torture imaginable. However, Italy has announced the Government can no longer take the strain as Eu nations refuse to share the burden of taking in refugees.

Vegas Golden Knights advance to Stanley Cup Final  [SEP]  WINNIPEG, Manitoba — The Vegas Golden Knights are going to the Stanley Cup Final — with a chip on their shoulder. "Everybody on this team has something to prove," Ryan Reaves said. "We call ourselves 'The Golden Misfits' for a reason. We're doing a good job of proving everybody wrong." Reaves scored the winning goal, Marc-Andre Fleury made 31 saves and the Golden Knights beat the Winnipeg Jets 2-1 on Sunday to wrap up the Western Conference final in five games. "It's insane," said defenseman Deryk Engelland, who grabbed the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl after the final buzzer to celebrate with his teammates. "Your goal is always to make the playoffs. But if I were to guess I would be sitting here doing this right now, you would be a little skeptical at the time." Alex Tuch also scored for the Knights. They lost Game 1 in Winnipeg before winning four straight to become the first expansion team since the 1968 St. Louis Blues — when the six initial expansion teams were put alone in the West — to get to the final. "It was their time," Winnipeg captain Blake Wheeler said. "They're just playing really well." Vegas will meet Tampa Bay or Washington in the final. Tampa Bay leads the Eastern final 3-2, with Game 6 set for Monday night in Washington. The Knights, whose jaw-dropping inaugural 109-point campaign included a Pacific Division crown, swept Los Angeles in the first round, and knocked out San Jose in six games in the second. "All those records and everything, it doesn't mean anything if you're not the last team standing," Vegas center Jonathan Marchessault said. "I think we have a lot of gas left." Josh Morrissey scored for the Jets, and Connor Hellebuyck made 30 saves. "It's very difficult to find that positive feeling at this moment," Jets coach Paul Maurice said. Reaves, the bruising Winnipeg native acquired from Pittsburgh before to the trade deadline in February, snapped a 1-1 tie with 6:39 left in the second period when he tipped Luca Sbisa's point shot past Hellebuyck. Reeves last goal before Sunday came 3 1/2 months ago while with Pittsburgh. "The guys that weren't playing, myself included, we stayed ready," Reaves said. "We had fun while we were doing it, but we worked hard so when we were called upon we were ready to go." Fleury stopped 151 of 161 shots in the series, and allowed just six goals the rest of the way after giving up four in the opener. "Everybody's stepping up at different times," Fleury said. Winnipeg got a power play early in the third, but couldn't muster much of anything. The Knights smothered much of the Jets' attack for the next 10 minutes, with Hellebuyck having to come up with big stops on William Karlsson and Eric Haula to keep his team within one. The Jets pressed with under 4 minutes to go, with Fleury stopping captain Blake Wheeler on the doorstep, but it wasn't nearly enough as the Knights closed out their third straight series on the road. The Jets had the NHL's second-best record with 114 points in the regular season. They advanced to the first conference final in city's history with a five-game victory over the Minnesota Wild in the opening round before topping the Presidents' Trophy-winning Nashville Predators in Game 7 on the road. The usual raucous, white-clad crowd at Bell MTS Place were silenced just 5:11 into Game 5 when Tuch jumped on Morrissey's turnover and fired his sixth past Hellebuyck. The Jets were tentative to start and it got worse after the opener as Vegas dominated the next couple of shifts, forcing some good saves from Hellebuyck before Winnipeg got its feet moving. After being outshot 7-1 in the first 7 minutes, the Jets finally pushed back and turned the tide with the next nine attempts on goal, culminating with Morrissey making amends for his early gaffe with 2:46 left in the period. Bryan Little won a faceoff in the offensive zone straight back to second-year defenseman, who blasted his first career playoff goal past Fleury's glove. One of Winnipeg's downfalls in the series through four games was an inability to maintain momentum. The Knights scored within 1:28 of a Jets' goal in each of the first four games — a crushing 12 seconds after Winnipeg tied Game 3, and an equally gut-wrenching 43 seconds after the Jets knotted Game 4 — but they managed to take the game to the locker rooms tied 1-1. Both teams had chances in the second period before Reaves made it 2-1, with Jets center Mathieu Perrault just missing on a pass from Little that had too much speed. Right after Reaves scored the second playoff goal of his career — and first since 2015 with St. Louis — Winnipeg's Nikolaj Ehlers rang a shot off the post on Fleury. NOTES: The Jets were an NHL-best 32-7-2 at home in the regular season, but were a pedestrian 5-4 in the playoffs, including losses in four of their last five post-season outings. …. Winnipeg had won a combined 13 straight at home before dropping a 2-1 decision in Game 4 against Nashville.
Medal of Honor: Trump awards nation's highest military honor to Vietnam veteran  [SEP]  WASHINGTON – Marine Sgt. Maj. John Canley’s astounding heroism in Vietnam 50 years ago speaks for itself, so loudly that Wednesday he’ll be awarded the Medal of Honor by President Donald Trump at a White House ceremony. Canley's daughter Patricia Sargent knows how her father took command of the undermanned Company A, First Battalion, First Marines despite shrapnel wounds during the bloody battle of Hue in 1968. How he set up a base while caught in a “deadly crossfire,” drew fire by darting into the open so his Marines could seize a building and carried wounded Marines to safety while exposing himself to the enemy. "Then-Gunnery Sergeant Canley’s heroic actions saved the lives of his teammates," according to the White House. She and Canley spoke about the recognition and the qualities he has that helped him earn it during an interview with USA TODAY. When Sargent talked to Marines gathering at hotel near the Pentagon to honor Canley, a smaller story stood out and illuminated what made Canley a transcendent leader. Canley had told a grimy, young Marine in the field that he need to clean up. So, the young man just out of high school filled a helmet with water, dipped in his razor and went at it. “My dad said to him, ‘Hey, hey. You’ve got to wash your face off and warm it up to get it soft before you shave,’” Sargent said. The old Marine told Sargent recently he still thinks about that moment. “Something as little as that,” the Marine told her. “But I was 18 years old. I didn’t know how to shave. He taught me that. Not only did I follow him and he saved my life and all these things. But he taught me those life lessons.” Canley seems uncomfortable with the attention being lavished on him. He prefers to talk about the Marines who served with him, people like John Ligato, the retired FBI agent who has advocated since 2005 for Canley to receive the nation's highest military honor. The battle for control of Hue was one of the bloodiest of the war. North Vietnamese soldiers and guerrillas had overrun the provincial capital during the Tet Offensive. Canley and his Marines, outnumbered and outgunned, were sent to retake the city. After the battle, legendary for its bloody house-to-house fighting, Canley received the Navy Cross, two Bronze Stars and the Purple Heart. To Canley, the young Marines who served in Vietnam are heroes. Heroes who suffered from bad leadership, shoddy packs and belts, and a lack of relevant training. Canley, who is African-American, said race wasn’t an issue. “We didn’t have a race problem,” he said. “We had a leadership problem. Period.” The gathering in Washington is an opportunity to renew acquaintances with Marines that Canley, 80, has known since 1955. “I’ve received a number of calls, letters thanking me for being their leader,” he said. “That’s an awesome feeling.” Sargent said her father’s informal classes on leadership continue to this day. “It’s about the individual. And whether it’s teaching things to them or getting obstacles out of their way so they can achieve other things. I think that’s been his life’s work. He’s done that for Marines. He’s done that for myself, my brother and sister. Now I see him passing those little snippets on to his grandkids. "I'm very proud of him."
Turkey Says Saudis, Qatar Should Attend Syria Peace Talks  [SEP]  Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Saudi Arabia and Qatar should join its meeting with Russia and Iran to discuss Syrian peace efforts. Russia, Turkey and Iran, which helped broker the withdrawal of civilians and militants from the Syrian city of Aleppo, have agreed to hold talks on Syria in Kazakhstan next month. Erdogan said Tuesday the meeting of foreign ministers should include Saudi Arabia and Qatar, saying they had "shown goodwill and given support" to Syria. Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar are the main backers of rebels seeking to topple Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is closely allied with Moscow and Tehran. Erdogan added, however, that Turkey would not take part if any "terror organizations" are also invited, referring to Syrian Kurdish groups affiliated with Kurdish insurgents in Turkey.
Suicide bomber kills 14 at Nigerian mosque – report  [SEP]  At least 14 people were killed after a suicide bomber detonated explosives inside a mosque in the town of Gamboru in Borno state, near Nigeria's border with Cameroon, civilian vigilantes told AFP. The incident reportedly took place shortly before morning prayers. "Fourteen bodies have been pulled out of the rubble,” said Umar Kachalla, a civilian militiaman, adding that the death toll may rise. The mosque was completely destroyed, Kachalla said.
Trump complains that the Saudi crown prince is being treated like Brett Kavanaugh.  [SEP]  Even as the Turkish government continues to leak information connecting the government of Saudi Arabia to the disappearance and possible murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, President Donald Trump remains protective of the Saudi regime. “I think we have to find out what happened first,” Trump told The Associated Press in an interview. “Here we go again with, you know, you’re guilty until proven innocent. I don’t like that. We just went through that with Justice Kavanaugh and he was innocent all the way as far as I’m concerned.” Earlier in the day, Trump tweeted that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had denied any knowledge of harm done to Khashoggi: Trump’s solicitude towards the Saudi government stands in contrast to the vocal condemnation being voiced by many other American politicians, including leading Republicans. Appearing on Fox and Friends, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said that the crown prince is “toxic” and “has got to go.” Graham promised to “sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia.” On Wednesday, The Washington Post, a newspaper that a special interest in the matter because it had employed Khashoggi as a columnist, condemned the Trump administration for conducting a “diplomatic cleanup operation” on behalf of the Saudi government.
Opinion | Ford Nation rises again: What Doug Ford means for Ontario  [SEP]  Up until a few months ago, discussions of Doug Ford becoming premier of Ontario were relegated to amusing hypothetical conversations. However, the hypothetical “what if” has become reality. The man many view as a Canadian Donald Trump has seized on a unique political opportunity to dethrone the province’s Liberal party and reassert Progressive Conservative control over the most populous province in Canada with a majority government. For some, the prospects of Ford’s tenure as premier are concerning if not downright frightening. There is an understandable fear that Ford’s brand of right-wing politics will bring sweeping reforms to social programs while undoing many of the progressive policies enacted under Kathleen Wynne’s Liberal government. While it’s impossible to predict precisely how his premiership will unfold, we can look to his rhetoric during the election campaign as well as his late brother Rob Ford’s tenure as mayor of Toronto for an indication of what might loom ahead. Doug Ford’s campaign platform was based on a number of well-worn conservative policy positions. From scrapping the carbon tax to reducing corporate tax rates and promising to balance Ontario’s budget within two years, Ford’s campaign, at least in terms of substance, relies on many of the same ideas and policy positions as other Canadian right-wing politicians. What marks his campaign as unique, at least in Canada, is that these positions are couched within the language of populism. Ford has offered his candidacy and his ideas as a way to expel Liberal elites from power, remove the influence of “radical special interests” and, most importantly, to create a government that works on behalf of the people. The populist framing of Ford’s campaign offers a reimagination of politics as a fight between hard-working, tax-paying citizens against out-of-touch “elites” beholden to special interests. While there is no crystal ball to predict how successful Ford will be in following through with the specific promises outlined in his campaign platform, Ontario residents can expect that the populist discourse used to defeat the Liberals and NDP during the campaign will continue, and may even intensify in the future, as Ford pursues his legislative agenda. With Ford at the helm, we should anticipate a major shift in political discourse over the next four years. Like Donald Trump to the south, Ford represents a different way of doing politics, one where political civility, technocratic knowledge and compromise are replaced by brashness, common-sense solutions and decisive unilateral action.
Suicide bombers attack Indonesian churches killing at least 11 people  [SEP]  Suicide bombers suspected to be from an Islamic State (Isis)-inspired group killed at least 11 people and wounded 40 in attacks on Christians attending Sunday morning services at three churches in Indonesia’s second-largest city of Surabaya, officials said. Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, has seen a recent resurgence in home grown militancy inspired in part by Islamic State. East Java police spokesman Frans Barung Mangera said explosions took place in three churches and at least 11 had died and 40 had been taken to hospital. He called on people to remain calm. “All places where the public can gather, security has been tightened in those places,” he told a news conference. Earlier, he told Reuters that an unexploded device at one location had been “secured”. Television footage showed one church where the yard in front appeared engulfed in fire, with thick, black smoke billowing up. A large blast was heard hours after the attacks, which Mr Mangera said was a bomb disposal squad dealing with a device. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks. Wawan Purwanto, communication director at Indonesia’s intelligence agency said Islamic State-inspired group Jemaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD) was believed to be behind the bombings. JAD is an umbrella organization on a US State Department “terrorist” list that is estimated to have drawn hundreds of Islamic State sympathizers in Indonesia. The attacks come days after militant Islamist prisoners killed five members of an elite counter-terrorism force during a 36-hour stand-off at a high security jail on the outskirts of the capital, Jakarta. The church attacks were likely linked to the prison hostage standoff, Mr Purwanto said. “The main target is still security authorities, but we can say that there are alternative (targets) if the main targets are blocked,” he said. At St Mary’s catholic church, the first place of worship to be attacked, the bombing happened after an earlier mass was over and when the church was getting ready to hold another service. Inspector general Machfud Arifin told CNN Indonesia the suicide attack at St Mary’s was carried out using a motorbike. A witness interviewed by CNN Indonesia said shortly before the explosion he saw a person on a motorbike drive in carrying a cardboard box. Separately, an internal police report reviewed by Reuters said a suspected bomb exploded in a car in the parking lot of a Pentacostal church, setting alight dozens of motorbikes. In the third location, the Indonesian Christian Church, two veiled women entered the church’s yard where they were stopped by a security guard before an explosion occurred at the same spot, according to the police report. Television images showed toppled and burnt motorcycles and debris scattered around the entrance of one church and police cordoning off areas as crowds gathered. President Joko Widodo was due to visit the wounded in Surabaya on Sunday, police said, while Indonesia’s foreign minister Retno Masudi condemned the attacks. “We will not back down in the fight against terrorism,” Ms Marsudi said in a message sent on Twitter. A spokesman for Indonesia’s church association (PGI) called on the government for more help on security at churches. “PGI is concerned because this had happened many times and often taken place around the time of Sunday services,” said Jeirry Sumampow, a spokesman for the Indonesia’s Communion of Churches. Nearly 90 percent of Indonesians are Muslim, but the country is also home to sizeable communities of Hindus, Christians, Buddhists, and people who adhere to traditional beliefs. Indonesia has had some major successes tackling militancy inspired by al Qaeda’s attacks on the United States in 2001. But there has been a resurgence of Islamist activity in recent years, some of it linked to the rise of Islamic State. The most serious incident was in January 2016 when four suicide bombers and gunmen attacked a shopping area in central Jakarta. Churches have also been targeted previously, including near-simultaneous attacks on churches there at Christmas in 2000 that killed about 20 people. – Reuters
Backpage.com, CEO plead guilty in California, Texas and Arizona  [SEP]  The chief executive of Backpage.com, a website authorities have described as an "online brothel," pleaded guilty Thursday to California money-laundering charges, while the company itself pleaded guilty to human trafficking in Texas. In addition to those pleas, federal prosecutors in Arizona announced Thursday Backpage.com and CEO Carl Ferrer had pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges on April 5. Under the California plea agreement, Ferrer will cooperate in prosecuting Backpage.com's creators and will serve no more than five years in state prison. He pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and three counts of money laundering in California. In the Arizona plea, Ferrer acknowledged knowing that a great majority of Backpage.com's ads were for sex services. He also admitted to conspiring with others at the company to launder the proceeds from such ads after credit card companies and banks refused to do business with the site. Ferrer also agreed to make the company's data available to law enforcement as investigations and prosecutions continue. The guilty pleas are the latest in a cascade of developments in the last week against the company founded by the former owners of the Village Voice in New York City, Michael Lacey, 69, and James Larkin, 68. The company founders were among company officials indicted by a federal grand jury in Arizona, while Ferrer, 57, was noticeably absent from the indictment. The U.S. Justice Department also seized and shut down the website used to prominently advertise escorts and massages, among other services and some goods for sale. Authorities allege the site was often used to traffic underage victims, while company officials said they tried to scrub the website of such ads. Attorneys for the company and the three men did not respond to multiple telephone and email messages from The Associated Press. "Human trafficking is modern-day slavery, and it is happening in our own backyard," California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement announcing the plea deal. "The shutdown of Backpage.com is a tremendous victory for the survivors and their families. And the conviction of CEO Ferrer is a game-changer in combating human trafficking in California, indeed worldwide." Larkin remains jailed in Arizona while he awaits a hearing Monday on whether he should be released after pleading not guilty to federal charges alleging he helped publish ads for sexual services. Magistrate Judge Bridget Bade said Thursday that attorneys have agreed on the terms of release, but other details must be ironed out. Four employees and the site's founders pleaded not guilty to the federal charges. Lacey and Larkin also earlier pleaded not guilty to the California charges after Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Larry Brown last year allowed the state to continue with money laundering charges. Prosecutors allege Backpage's operators illegally funneled nearly $45 million through multiple companies and created websites to get around banks that refused to process their transactions. But Brown threw out pimping conspiracy and other state charges against Backpage's operators. Brown ruled that the charges are barred by a federal law protecting free speech that grants immunity to websites posting content from others. President Donald Trump this week signed a law making it easier to prosecute website operators in the future. Paxon called Thursday's pleas "a significant victory in the fight against human trafficking in Texas and around the world." Texas state agents raided the Dallas headquarters of Backpage and arrested Ferrer on a California warrant after he arrived at Houston's Bush Intercontinental Airport on a flight from Amsterdam on Oct. 6, 2016. The Dutch-owned company is incorporated in Delaware, but its principal place of business is in Dallas. The Associated Press contributed to this report.
US arrests, accuses woman of acting as Russian agent  [SEP]  WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal prosecutors in Washington revealed Monday that they have arrested a 29-year-old woman and accused her of acting as a covert agent inside the U.S. on behalf of a senior Kremlin official. The announcement of the arrest of Maria Butina came just hours after President Donald Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and just days after special counsel Robert Mueller charged 12 Russian intelligence officials with directing a sprawling hacking effort aimed at swaying the 2016 election. Butina, a Russian national who has been living the U.S., was charged with conspiracy to act as an unregistered agent of the Russian government and accused of working to infiltrate American political organizations, including the National Rifle Association. The charge was brought the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia and do not appear to stem from Mueller's investigation. According to court papers, Butina met with U.S. politicians and candidates, attended events sponsored by special interest groups — including two National Prayer Breakfast events — and organized Russian-American "friendship and dialogue" dinners in Washington with the goal of "reporting back to Moscow" what she had learned. Court papers do not name the Kremlin official. The person is described as a member of the Russian legislature who later became a top official in the country's central bank. Prosecutors also note that the official has since been sanctioned by the U.S. Butina is a Russian gun rights advocate who founded a pro-gun organization in that country, the Right to Bear Arms, in 2011 and who has been involved in coordinating in recent years between American gun rights activists and their Russian counterparts, U.S. media accounts have reported. Butina hosted several leading NRA executives and pro-gun conservatives at her group's annual meeting in 2015, according to the reports in The New York Times, Time and the Daily Beast. Among those who attended were former NRA President David Keene, conservative political operative Paul Erickson and former Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, later a strong Trump supporter. Associated Press writers Stephen Braun and Desmond Butler contributed to this report.
20,000 fans flee huge fire at Tomorrowland EDM festival in Barcelona  [SEP]  CLOSE A video grab made from footage by Angel Rodao, via Instagram account @mayde_luna, shows flames and smoke at Tomorrowland music festival in Santa Coloma de Gramenet near Barcelona. Organizers blamed the fire Saturday night on a technical malfunction. (Photo: Angel Rodao via Instagram, AFP/Getty Images) BARCELONA — A huge fire at a music festival in Spain forced the evacuation of more than 20,000 concertgoers and incinerated the event's stage in Barcelona, the regional government said Sunday. The fire Saturday night consumed the large outdoor stage at Tomorrowland EDM festival held at Parc de Can Zam. Twelve firefighting units needed around an hour to extinguish the flames just before midnight. Firefighters said they were investigating the cause. Tomorrowland published a statement on Facebook saying the "stage caught fire due to a technical malfunction." Barcelona firefighters said there were no serious injuries during the evacuation but the event's private security treated 20 people for minor injuries or anxiety. Video images show the fire starting at the top of a tall temporary structure erected on the stage where a large screen showed a performer singing. The towering flames quickly spread until they engulfed the entire stage. In a statement, regional authorities said the fire "completely destroyed the stage" and that its charred remains "run the risk of collapsing." The festival in Barcelona was one of several offshoots of a main Tomorrowland festival in Belgium. Organizers said the Barcelona event was canceled following the fire.

Avalanche kills 4 skiers in France; 1 injured, 1 missing  [SEP]  PARIS — French authorities say four skiers have been killed, one is injured and another is missing after an avalanche in the southern Alps. The French gendarmerie said the avalanche happened Friday in Entraunes, near the Italian border. The cause of the avalanche is unknown. During a visit to the southern city of Nice, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told reporters that rescue operations are still ongoing. Local media said the skiers, including a guide, were off-trail in a remote area of the Mercantour national park. French authorities had warned against a high risk of avalanche in the Alps following heavy snowfall in recent days.
Father Massacres 3 Children, Wife's Boyfriend in Ponder Murder-Suicide: Sheriff's Office  [SEP]  A North Texas mother is hospitalized after her ex-husband came to her home early Wednesday and opened fire, injuring her and killing their three children and her boyfriend before turning the gun on himself, sheriff's deputies say. (Published Thursday, May 17, 2018) A North Texas mother is hospitalized after her ex-husband came to her home early Wednesday and opened fire, injuring her and killing their three children and her boyfriend before turning the gun on himself, sheriff's deputies say. The identities of the children were confirmed by the Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office Thursday as Drake Painter, 4, Caydence Painter, 6 and Odin Painter, 8. The mother who survived the shooting is identified as Amanda Simpson. Wednesday night, she posted a public Facebook video showing her sobbing from her hospital bed as she held a photo of her three young children while talking about her troubled relationship with her ex-husband. The Denton County Sheriff's Department identified her ex-husband as Justin Painter. Investigators believe he was the gunman. In the Facebook video, Simpson said she spoke with Painter on Tuesday and that he wanted to reconcile, but she said no. The Ponder Volunteer Fire Department said Wednesday morning they were called to a home in the 600 block of Lone Star Park Lane at about 8:30 a.m. Shortly before arrival, firefighters were told there were multiple victims inside the home and that several ambulances had been requested. Officials with the Denton County Sheriff's Department confirmed to NBC 5 later in the day that the five people found dead inside the home were three children, their mother's boyfriend, Seth Richardson, and their father, Justin Painter, the suspected shooter.

Sri Lanka PM Rajapaksa to resign as fears of govt shutdown grow  [SEP]  COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka’s Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa will resign from his post, his son said on Friday, in a move that will force President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint a replacement to avert a possible government shutdown on Jan 1. “To ensure stability of the nation, former president ... Rajapaksa has decided to resign from the Premiership tomorrow after an address to the nation,” Namal Rajapaksa, an MP in his father’s party, said on his Twitter account. The South Asian island has been in political gridlock for over a month since Sirisena replaced former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe with Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was then twice sacked by parliament but has refused to resign. Sirisena did not accept the parliamentary votes, saying that due procedure was not followed. It remains unclear how he plans to end the political crisis that threatens to shut down the government on Jan. 1 because a temporary budget must be approved by parliament before that. Separately on Friday, the country’s Supreme Court rejected Rajapaksa’s bid for an injunction on a lower court’s order that barred him and his cabinet from carrying out their roles in government. Many foreign countries have not recognised Rajapaksa’s government. Credit rating agencies Fitch and Standard & Poor’s have downgraded Sri Lanka, citing refinancing risks and an uncertain policy outlook. Earlier this week, the island nation’s parliament passed a vote of confidence in favour of Wickremesinghe, as it sought his reinstatement as prime minister by the president to defuse the political crisis. Sirisena has repeatedly said he will not appoint Wickremesinghe “even if he has the backing of all 225 lawmakers in parliament”.
Petrobras oilfield sale to Statoil suspended by Brazil court  [SEP]  A Brazilian court orders Petrobras (NYSE:PBR) to suspend the sale of its stake in an exploratory block to Statoil (NYSE:STO) after the National Federation of Oil Workers argued that the state-controlled company is required to hold an open bid for any asset sale. PBR says half of the $2.5B in proceeds were due when the deal for the stake in the Carcara field closed in November, and that it had used those funds to pay down debts. The sale of the 66% stake in the offshore prospect was the first major pre-salt asset sold as part of PBR's divestment plan that seeks to raise $21B in two years to repay debts.
Report: North Korea Makes Own Rocket Engines, Does Not Need Ukraine Technology  [SEP]  Reuters is quoting U.S. intelligence officials as saying they believe North Korea can produce its own missile engines and does not need to import the technology from Ukraine. The Reuters report on August 15 provides backing to Ukraine, which has denied supplying North Korea with any missile technology, and runs counter to a new study by the International Institute for Strategic Studies which said that Pyongyang likely obtained the engines used in its latest ballistic missile tests on the black market from factories in Ukraine or Russia. Reuters quotes one U.S. intelligence official as saying "We have intelligence to suggest that North Korea is not reliant on imports of engines... Instead, we judge they have the ability to produce the engines themselves." TASS also reported on August 15 that U.S. intelligence officials believe North Korea can make the rocket engines on its own. The New York Times on August 14 said U.S. intelligence officials thought the engines likely came from a former Cold War weapons factory in Ukraine. When asked about the matter on August 15, U.S, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert appeared to side with Ukraine, saying it has a "very strong nonproliferation record."

Emergency alert test going out to mobile phones nationwide  [SEP]  It is the first test of the national wireless emergency system by FEMA. The message will be broadcast by cell towers for 30 minutes, so it's possible some people may get it at a different time. The alerts will sound as long as the device is turned on — even if it's on mute or do not disturb, and it may also appear on smart watches, officials said.
Reddit boots 944 accounts linked to Internet Research Agency, Russian ‘troll farm’  [SEP]  Reddit, the fourth most-visited website in the U.S., has booted nearly 1,000 accounts believed to be run by the Internet Research Agency, the alleged Russian “troll farm” accused of exploiting social media networks including Facebook and Twitter during the suspected state-sponsored attack on the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A total of 944 accounts have been identified by Reddit as being “of suspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin,” the site’s chief executive said in a post published in tandem with the release of its annual transparency report Tuesday. All the suspicious accounts have been disabled, and their activity has been temporarily preserved and shared with congressional investigators examining Russia’s role in the 2016 race, Reddit co-founder and CEO Steve Huffmanwrote on the website. Few of the nearly 1,000 accounts had any visible impact on Reddit, and none of them were linked to purchasing any adds like on other platforms, wrote Mr. Huffman. Some of the accounts were relatively popular, however, and combined they posted about 14,000 times before being identified and disabled, said Mr. Huffman. Mr. Huffman previously said that only a “few hundred” likely IRA accounts had been identified and expunged as of early March as part of the website’s internal investigation “We still have a lot of room to improve, and we intend to remain vigilant,” he said Tuesday. The U.S. intelligence community has assessed that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 race, and the Department of Justice appointed special counsel Robert Mueller in May to investigate claims involving Moscow’s involvement. Mr. Mueller’s investigation has since culminated in criminal indictments charging companies and individuals in the U.S. and abroad, including the IRA, its accused mastermind, Kremlin-linked businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, and a dozen other Russians connected to the company. The IRA “conducted operations on social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter,” according to the special counsel’s office, “…with the stated goal of ‘spread[ing] distrust towards the candidates and the political system in general.’” Facebook has linked the IRA to content reached by about 126 million Americans surrounding the 2016 race, including about $100,000 worth of advertisements, and Google said the IRA investigated $4,700 into its ad network during the same span. Twitter, meanwhile, has said that about 1.4 million users engaged in some form or another with any of nearly 4,000 likely IRA accounts. “We didn’t see any political ads from Russia during the election. Nevertheless, we no longer accept advertising from Russia at all,” said Mr. Huffman. Reddit is ranked fourth nationally and sixth globally based on a combination of daily visitors and pageviews over the past month, according to Alexa, the Amazon-owned internet ranking service. Four congressional panels are investigating the 2016 election separately from the special counsel’s office, including committees in both the House and Senate.
No need for Congress to hide Rahul-Chinese envoy meeting: Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu  [SEP]  Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu on Monday questioned the "secrecy" over the meeting between Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi and Chinese Ambassador to India Luo Zhaohui, an interaction that has raised eyebrows in the political circles. The Congress first denied in the morning that Gandhi met the Chinese envoy and then made a U-turn hours later. "The Congress leader met the Chinese ambassador. What is so secret about it? They should make it public. Why should they try to hide it?" Naidu told reporters in reply to a question on the sidelines of an event. Gandhi took to Twitter in the evening to defend his meeting with the Chinese envoy and said it was his job "to be informed on critical issues," referring to the India-China stand-off. He said if the government was concerned about his meeting with the Chinese ambassador, they should also question the three Union ministers who are "availing Chinese hospitality when the border stand-off is on". Gandhi also posted on his Twitter handle a photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Chinese President Xi Jinping sitting on a swing to take a dig at the government. "And for the record, I am not the guy sitting on the swing while a thousand Chinese troops had physically entered India (sic)," he tweeted, referring to Chinese president's visit to Gujarat in 2014. Reacting to this, Naidu said there was no need to respond to such comments. "Diplomatic relations, meeting foreign dignitaries ... There is a procedure, there is a practice and it is transparent," he said. "The Prime Minister, as the head of the government. Whenever he goes out for an international conference ... on the sidelines, he meets the heads of the States, hold discussions, and sometimes there is only meeting and greeting. What is there to criticise? I am not able to understand," he said.
Babri case: Oppn demands Bharti's resignation, action against others  [SEP]  Congress leader Pramod Tiwari said those ministers holding constitutional positions must offer their resignations. Congress leader Nawab Malik said Union Water Resources and River Development Minister Uma Bharti is also a conspirator in the matter and so it becomes the responsibility of Modi to immediately sack her from the position. (Photo: PTI) New Delhi/Mumbai: Welcoming the Supreme Court's decision of allowing the Central Bureau of Investigation's (CBI) appeal challenging the withdrawal of conspiracy charges against senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders including L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, the Congress Party on Wednesday demanded action against them. Congress leader Pramod Tiwari said those ministers holding constitutional positions must offer their resignations. "I salute the Supreme Court. Although the decision came late, it was expected. The BJP tried a lot so that justice is not delivered. It is said that justice delayed is justice denied. All the tactics of the BJP has failed," he added. Resonating similar sentiments, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Nawab Malik said Union Water Resources and River Development Minister Uma Bharti is also a conspirator in the matter and so it becomes the responsibility of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately sack her from the position. "It also becomes the responsibility of Kalyan Singh to resign from his post," he added. The apex court has ruled that senior BJP leaders including Advani, Bharti and Joshi will face criminal conspiracy charges in the Babri Masjid demolition case. The apex court has directed the sessions judge in Lucknow to conduct the trial in the Babri demolition case on a daily basis, and that the judge will not be transferred. It also ruled out a fresh trial in the case. The top court has also ordered the CBI to ensure that witnesses are produced in court everyday so that there is no delay in the Babri demolition case trial. The trial will have to be completed in two years. However, the apex court has clarified that Kalyan Singh, being Governor of Rajasthan, will not be tried due to constitutional immunity unless he ceases to be in that post. In effect, his trial will begin after his term as Governor ends. Singh was the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh when the demolition took place. Others who will face criminal conspiracy charges are Vinay Katiyar, Sadhvi Ritambara, Satish Pradhan, Champat Rai Bansal. The late Giriraj Kishore is also among the names in the original chargesheet. There were two sets of cases relating to the demolition of the disputed structure on December 6, 1992. The first involved unnamed 'karsevaks' or volunteers, the trial of which is taking place in a Lucknow court, while the second set of cases relate to the VVIPs in a Rae Bareli court. With Wednesday's order, both these cases are merged and will be heard in Lucknow. The order comes after the CBI had petitioned the apex court saying 14 people, including BJP leaders, who had been acquitted of the charges under criminal conspiracy, should be tried in the Lucknow Court.

Hurricane Maria LIVE: 8am update from the National Hurricane Center - NOAA latest path  [SEP]  Hurricane Maria is forecast to bring “dangerous wind, storm surge and heavy rainfall” to the Dominican Republic, the Turks and Caicos and the Bahamas. Maximum sustained winds remain at 115mph, though they could increase further as Hurricane Maria shifts onto a more northerly path through tomorrow. After wreaking havoc over Puerto Rico yesterday, the hurricane is now barrelling towards the Turks and Caicos Islands. Maria was last located about 95 miles north of Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, and about 190 miles southeast of Grand Turk Island, the capital of the Turks and Caicos.
Astronomers Directly Detect Iron and Titanium on an Exoplanet for the First Time  [SEP]  Illustration: NASA/JPL-Caltech Scientists directly observed the signal of iron and titanium atoms in the atmosphere of an exoplanet 600 light-years from Earth, a new paper reports. KELT-9b is a planet entirely alien to our own Solar System—it’s 2.88 times the mass of Jupiter, with a year lasting just 1.5 Earth days and temperatures over 4,000 Kelvin (6,740 Fahrenheit). It’s the hottest known exoplanet, and the site of the first exoplanetary observation of iron and titanium atoms. It’s a stepping stone that will help astronomers one day characterize the atmospheres of more hospitable planets. Advertisement “It’s hard to distinguish an exoplanet like Venus from an exoplanet like Earth,” study author Jens Hoeijmakers from the University of Geneva in Switzerland told Gizmodo. “We need to recognize the chemistry in the atmospheres of exoplanets. KELT-9b is an easy target, an easy system to understand. My philosophy is if you cannot do the easy cases, then you cannot do the hard cases either.” The data came from a July 31, 2017 observation made by the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo on the Spanish Canary Island of La Palma. The telescope recorded the planet passing in front the blazingly hot blue giant KELT-9 star, essentially acting as a light filter, tweaking the colors of the starlight. Subtracting the light collected from just the star from the light collected when the planet passed in front of the star revealed the spectral lines of titanium and iron. The researchers also detected a slight shift to the spectral wavelengths: the Doppler effect signature of the planet moving through space. This confirmed that the spectral lines didn’t come from the star or dust in the intervening space, according to the paper published in Nature. Advertisement Astronomers from the University of Bern, the University of Geneva, and others contributed to the discovery. The Bern researchers, without showing this data to Hoeijmakers, asked him to independently simulate KELT-9b to see if it would have visible iron. His simulations found that, yes, the planet should have iron visible to an observer. This bolstered their confidence that they had truly observed iron and titanium on the exoplanet. Illustration: Denis Bajram Advertisement While iron is abundant here on Earth, it’s a difficult element to measure on exoplanets due to its optical properties. As far as Hoeijmakers and other sources we spoke to could tell, this was the first direct detection of an iron or titanium atom on an exoplanet, though other results have hinted at the presence of these elements. This discovery helps scientists determine the nature of the planet and how it formed. More generally, it serves as an important advance on the journey to fully characterizing exoplanet atmospheres. Advertisement “The Hoeijmakers paper is a great first step in identifying the chemical ingredients of the atmosphere,” Laura Kreidberg from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics told Gizmodo. It “opens the door to many more investigations—searching for additional chemical species and observing different regions of the planet’s atmosphere.” Fully understanding an exoplanet’s atmosphere could ultimately help scientists tell the difference between an Earth-like or a Venus-like planet—a crucial distinction if you’re hunting for life. The goal is to find biosignatures, molecular spectra indicating that a planet’s atmosphere has been altered by some life form. Advertisement Others were interested in the planet by itself. “It’s so strongly irradiated that it’s hotter than most stars,” Drake Deming, astronomy professor at the University of Maryland who reviewed the paper, told Gizmodo. He noted that the most common stars in the galaxy aren’t like the Sun, but are cooler, dim M-dwarfs, as opposed to our sun, a hotter G-type main sequence star (sometimes called a yellow dwarf). Hoeijmakers noted that the paper was the result of an intense amount of collaboration between researchers, and felt it was a model of how science should be done. He said: “Every single person on the author list made a crucial contribution to this story.” Advertisement And there will be plenty more opportunities to collaborate. Scientists will soon have many more observations to analyze, both from the telescope at La Palma and other future telescopes. [Nature]
3 Bay Area firefighters injured while fighting Carr Fire  [SEP]  Bay Area firefighters are on the front lines of the Carr Fire burning in Shasta County. Already, three have been injured.Pleasant Hill sent a strike team on Wednesday. Contra Costa County is just one of five counties in the Bay Area to send help.The firefighters still here in the Bay Area are no doubt thinking of their co-workers and the danger they are in as news comes in of the injured firefighters.Three firefighters from Marin County were hurt in the Carr fire -- they were part of a strike team that actually left for another fire but were moved to the Carr fire in Redding. They were hurt Wednesday night."The fire laid down in a large timber grove, they were adjacent to it, took quite a bit of heat. Three of the firefighters sustained minor to moderate burns to their hands, head, face. They were treated at Redding Medical Center. All three had been released by earlier this morning, one of them is in route now to UC Davis Burn Center for additional follow up care but I'm happy to report that all three are in good spirits, they're doing well," said Marin County Fire Dept. Chief Jason Weber.They were working all day Wednesday from 1 a.m. to 8 p.m. to try and save as many structures as they could.Back here at home, fire officials in Contra Costa County say the fact that Cal Fire is pulling from so many different counties indicates how drawn down state resources are because of all these fires.
Former Gaddafi stronghold revolts against Tripoli  [SEP]  * Town was one of main pro-Gaddafi bastions during war BANI WALID, Libya, Jan 24 Libya's ramshackle government lost control of a former stronghold of Muammar Gaddafi on Tuesday after local people staged an armed uprising, posing the gravest challenge yet to the country's new rulers. Elders in Bani Walid, where militias loyal to the ruling National Transitional Council (NTC) were driven out in a gunbattle a day earlier, said they were appointing their own local government and rejected any interference from the authorities in the capital Tripoli. The town's revolt will heighten doubts in the West about the NTC government's ability to instil law and order crucial to rebuilding oil exports, to disarm tribal militias and guard Libyan borders in a region where al Qaeda is active. Local elders denied reports that they were loyal to Gaddafi, who was captured and killed in October after weeks on the run, and Reuters reporters in Bani Walid saw no signs of the Gaddafi-era green flags which witnesses earlier said had been hoisted over the town. But the collapse of NTC authority in the town, one of the most die-hard bastions of pro-Gaddafi sentiment during Libya's nine-month civil war last year, will compound the problems besetting a government that in the past week has been staggering from one crisis to another. The uprising in Bani Walid could not come at a worse time for the National Transitional Council government. In the past week its chief has had his office overrun by protesters angry at the slow pace of reform and the second most senior official has quit, citing what he described as an "atmosphere of hatred." Reuters reporters who entered Bani Walid on Tuesday morning saw a few of the black, green and red flags of last year's anti-Gaddafi rebellion but there was no sign of any central government presence. About 200 elders who gathered in a mosque decided to abolish an NTC-appointed military council for the town and appoint their own local council, in direct defiance of the authority of the government in Tripoli. "If (NTC chief Mustafa) Abdel Jalil is going to force anyone on us, we won't accept that by any means," one of the elders, Ali Zargoun, told Reuters at the mosque. Accounts from Bani Walid, a town about 200 km (120 miles) from Tripoli, late on Monday described armed Gaddafi supporters attacking the barracks of the pro-government militia in the town and then forcing them to retreat. A fighter with the routed pro-government militia told Reuters the loyalists were flying "brand new green flags" from the centre of town. The flags were symbols of Gaddafi's maverick, 42-year dictatorship. But elders on Tuesday disputed that account. "In the Libyan revolution, we have all become brothers. We will not be an obstacle to progress," said another elder, Miftah Jubarra. "Regarding allegations of pro-Gaddafi elements in Bani Walid, this is not true. This is the media. You will go around the city and find no green flags or pictures of Gaddafi." Bani Walid, base of the powerful Warfallah tribe, was one of the last towns to surrender to the anti-Gaddafi rebellion last year. A Libyan air official said war planes were being mobilised to fly to Bani Walid. But it was not immediately clear what the government in Tripoli could do. It has yet to demonstrate that it has an effective fighting force under its command and Bani Walid, protected behind a deep valley, is difficult to attack. During Libya's nine-month war, anti-Gaddafi NTC rebels tried to take Bani Walid but did not progress much beyond the outskirts of the town. It later emerged that Saif al-Islam, one of Muammar Gaddafi's sons who was captured in the Sahara desert in November, had been using Bani Walid as a base. Soon before the end of the conflict, with Gaddafi's defeat unavoidable, local tribal elders negotiated an agreement under which forces loyal to the NTC were able to enter the town without a fight. Relations have been uneasy since then and there have been occasional flare-ups of violence. A local resident, who did not want to be identified, said Monday's violence began when members of the May 28 militia, affiliated to the NTC, arrested some former Gaddafi loyalists. That prompted other supporters of the former leader to attack the militia's garrison. "They massacred men at the doors of the militia headquarters," said the resident. The NTC still has the backing of the NATO powers who, with their diplomatic pressure and bombing campaign, helped push out Gaddafi and install the new government. NTC authorities pledged to unify the tribally-divided country, reconstruct its once mighty oil industry that made Libya a major exporter in OPEC, and hold democratic elections. But questions are now being raised inside some Western governments about the NTC's ability to govern Libya effectively and secure its frontiers against al Qaeda, arms traffickers and illegal migrants trying to get into Europe. The NTC tumbled into its worst crisis since the end of the civil war at the weekend when a crowd of protesters in the eastern city of Benghazi stormed the council's local headquarters when NTC chief Mustafa Abdel Jalil was inside. The protesters, who supported the revolt against Gaddafi, were angry that more progress had not been made to restore basic public services. They also said many of the NTC's members were tarnished by having served in Gaddafi's administration. Abdel Hafiz Ghoga, deputy head of the NTC and target of some of the protests, said he was resigning. Abdel Jalil warned that the protests could drag the country into a "bottomless pit."

Gani‚ of the law firm Gani Mayet Attorneys in Johannesburg‚ said that he had yet to receive any documents pertaining to a search and seizure warrant that saw heavily armed Hawks officers raid the family’s Saxonwold compound early on Wednesday. Gani was summoned from his Houghton offices after a call for assistance by an employee of the Guptas.
Philippines President Duterte tells corrupt mayors to resign or die - SitiBe.com  [SEP]  Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte warned mayors in his country that remain on his suspected drug dealing list that they leave the trade or be killed. During an oath-taking ceremony of over 200 appointees on Monday, the 71-year-old leader said that the mayors should resign and ‘make a clean break of everything’ or he would ‘really kill you’. ‘I will call the mayors, I will lock them in so it’s just us,’ he said in his speech. ‘I will really tell them, ‘The list I gave you is this thick. Look for your name there, mayor’. ‘If your name is there, son of a b****, you have a problem, I will really kill you.’ ‘Either you resign or make a clean break of everything, come up with clean nose and we’ll talk,’ he added. Duterte said that mayors who have ties to the drug dealing industry should be prepared to have their security and power taken away, Rappler.com reported. ‘The first thing that I would do is to deprive you of the supervisory powers over the police, second is I will remove all of your security detail,’ he said. ‘I might go down [in]history as the butcher. It’s up to you,’ he added. Duterte has previously voiced suspicion that mayors are using their power to ensure police leaders don’t get in the way of drug trade in their cities and towns. The president has made several threats to kill people connected to drug trade in the country, but insists the recent wave of drug trade deaths are not the work of the government. Duterte was elected earlier this year partly because he promised to get tough on criminals in the Philippines, an overwhelmingly Catholic country. He has made reviving the death penalty one of his priorities as part of a brutal war on crime that has already seen 5,300 people killed. Eighty percent of Filipinos are Catholics and the Philippines abolished the death penalty in 2006 following a campaign by the Catholic Church. But during his election campaign Duterte had vowed to introduce executions by hanging, saying he did not want to waste bullets and believed snapping the spinal cord was more humane than a firing squad. Duterte, who was known for his crime-busting antics during his time as Mayor of the southern city of Davao, said he thought the point of the death penalty was retribution, not deterrence. Duterte’s war on crime has drawn international criticism from the United States and United Nations over concerns about extrajudicial killings and a breakdown in the rule of law. A survey by Social Weather Stations released today showed a majority backed Duterte’s war on drugs but 78 per cent were worried they or someone in their family would become a victim of extrajudicial killings. The survey also showed 71 per cent said it was ‘very important’ police keep suspects alive. Police have repeatedly said they only killed criminals who fought back but the nation’s rights agency has begun investigating several armed encounters.
The Latest: 3 arrested in connection with overpass collapse  [SEP]  ATLANTA (AP) — The Latest on the collapse of a section of an interstate in Atlanta (all times local): Officials say three people have been arrested in connection with a massive fire under Interstate 85 in Atlanta that caused a portion of the bridge to collapse. Deputy Insurance Commissioner Jay Florence confirms the suspects were arrested Friday. He identified them as Basil Eleby, Sophia Bruner and Barry Thomas. Eleby faces a charge of criminal damage to property, while Bruner and Thomas each was charged with criminal trespass. Florence did not have ages or hometowns of the three, all of whom were being held at the Fulton County Jail. Florence did not say how they were developed as suspects but noted they were interviewed throughout the day and law enforcement subsequently made the arrests. He would not discuss how the fire was started or why, saying those details would be released as the investigation progresses. Officials say they haven't determined the cause of a raging fire that collapsed an elevated span of Interstate 85 in Atlanta, where commuters can expect months of traffic headaches during lengthy repairs. Georgia Department of Transportation Commissioner Russell McMurray told news reporters Friday the site beneath the collapsed roadway was used to store noncombustible, state-owned construction materials. They included coils of plastic conduit used in fiber optic networks. McMurry said at least 350 feet of Interstate 85 northbound and southbound will have to be replaced, a job he said would take months. He would not give a more specific timeline. Atlanta Fire Chief Joel Baker noted that even noncombustible materials can still burn. He said the materials burning beneath the collapsed span "generated a whole lot of heat." An expert in structural engineering says intense heat from a raging fire could have caused an elevated section of Interstate 85 in Atlanta to degrade and eventually collapse. Lauren Stewart is the director of the Structural Engineering and Materials Laboratory at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. She said Friday that even steel-reinforced concrete is susceptible to breaking down in fires that "burn for long periods and with high heat." A raging fire Thursday afternoon caused a 350-foot section of the interstate to collapse north of downtown Atlanta. Officials say commuters and travelers will have to use alternate routes for months while repairs are made. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. Officials say commuter behavior shifted quickly after a section of Interstate 85 in Atlanta collapsed amid a massive fire, shutting down the busy highway for at least the next several months. Georgia Department of Transportation Commissioner Russell McMurry said there was a 70 percent decrease Friday morning in the number of cars on the sections of I-85 leading up to the now-closed section. There was also a 20 to 25 percent increase in traffic on the major roads surrounding the interstate, he said. Keith Parker, CEO of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, or MARTA, said there was a 25 percent surge in ridership and a nearly 80 percent increase in sales Friday morning. Parker called it "an opportunity to make sure everyone knows that there are alternatives to driving alone." Federal transportation officials have awarded $10 million in emergency funds to help repair a collapsed section of Interstate 85 in Atlanta. A U.S. Department of Transportation news release says Secretary Elaine Chao spoke to Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal on Friday and let him know about the money. The overpass collapsed during the Thursday afternoon rush hour after a massive fire broke out beneath the interstate in an area used to store construction materials. The agency says the "quick release" funding will be used to restore emergency access and begin the most critical repairs in the next few weeks. The funds for short-term repairs "can make long-term repair work possible in the weeks ahead." The bridge was built in 1953 and reconstructed in 1985 to accommodate higher traffic volumes. Georgia's governor says the federal government is offering help that will let the state, city and private contractors "immediately" assess the damage and begin repairs after a section of Interstate 85 collapsed amid a massive fire. Deal's statement said officials with the Federal Highway Administration and U.S. Department of Transportation joined state officials for a briefing on Friday morning. The governor warned that the repair will be a long process. Deal said beams for a new bridge will have to be manufactured, tested, transported and individually installed. He says public safety is the primary concern and asks for patience and understanding. Commuters in Atlanta have been struggling to get to work on time the morning after a section of Interstate 85 collapsed, forcing them to find alternate routes. Connie Bailey-Blake of Dacula, 37 miles northeast of Atlanta, was catching a MARTA commuter train Friday morning to reach her job in downtown Atlanta. She typically drives 46 miles to work, often using the interstate. Bailey-Blake said: "The first few days are going to be difficult." She arrived at the train station at 9:15 a.m. — 15 minutes past when her work day was supposed to start. Amelia Ford, who lives in Atlanta, opted to find another route to work by car Friday said it took her 45 minutes to travel 3 miles from her home to the nearest open interstate exit. She said other drivers were being "surprisingly, pretty patient." A man who was watching as a section of Interstate 85 in Atlanta collapsed said he heard several explosions under the bridge and then a slow rumbling as the structure collapsed. Bobby Barnhart works in sales for a financial technology company near the interstate. He said he and his colleagues were watching from about 60 yards away as the fire raged and the bridge went down during rush hour Thursday afternoon. "It was a loud, muted rumble. It was a big sound. You could feel the vibrations," he said. With the interstate closed in both directions, he said his Friday commute into work on nearby streets was much more jammed than usual, taking him about 30 minutes rather than the normal 10 to 15 minutes. Bridge inspectors have determined that the southbound lanes of Interstate 85 sustained damage from a fire that caused the adjacent northbound section to collapse and will also need to remain closed for the foreseeable future. Georgia Department of Transportation Commissioner Russell McMurry said in a news release Friday that the extent of the fire-related damage will require extensive reconstruction to ensure driver safety. McMurry said the agency hasn't been able to assess the full extent of the damage because of lingering hotspots. He said it's unclear how long the reconstruction will take but that it's expected to be time consuming. McMurry says the fire started in an area that was used as a storage location for construction materials, equipment and supplies. Authorities are still working to determine how the fire started. Streets in Atlanta were clogged with traffic Friday morning after a massive fire caused a section of Interstate 85 to collapse, closing the major artery for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, or MARTA, added extra trains to accommodate additional passengers who may try to avoid the roads altogether. MARTA CEO Keith Parker told The Associated Press the transit system was seeing strong crowds but that everything was going well. He urged people to remember that trains can get people from the system's northernmost points to downtown in about 20 minutes and that a trip between downtown and the airport takes about 15 minutes. The collapse happened during the afternoon rush hour on Thursday and officials have said there's no way to tell when the highway can be safely reopened to traffic in either direction. Atlanta's rapid transit system is increasing service to accommodate increased ridership expected after a massive fire caused a section of Interstate 85 to collapse. The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, or MARTA, says it's increasing rail services and will have additional staff on hand to help passengers. The fire and subsequent collapse happened during the Thursday afternoon rush hour. Georgia Department of Transportation Commissioner Russell McMurry says there's no way to tell when the highway can be safely reopened to traffic in either direction. The interstate, which carries 250,000 cars a day, is a major thoroughfare for traffic heading north and south through Atlanta. Georgia State Patrol Commissioner Mark McDonough says the bridge collapse effectively "puts a cork in the bottle." A major effect on traffic in a city already known for gridlock is expected after a massive fire caused a bridge on Interstate 85 to collapse in Atlanta. Georgia's top transportation official says there's no way to tell when the highway can be safely reopened to traffic in either direction following the collapse, which happened Thursday afternoon during rush hour. Department of Transportation Commissioner Russell McMurry says the collapse "will have a tremendous impact on travel." The interstate is a major artery for the U.S. South and a thoroughfare for traffic heading north and south through Atlanta. Traffic was bumper to bumper on nearby streets Thursday night as people scrambled to find alternate routes. However, officials say no one was hurt despite dramatic images of towering flames and smoke.
South Korea's Moon says North seeking 'complete denuclearisation'  [SEP]  SEOUL: North Korea has expressed its desire for "complete denuclearisation" of the Korean peninsula and is not seeking conditions such as US troops withdrawing from the South first, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Thursday (Apr 19). Moon said big-picture agreements about normalisation of relations between the two Koreas and the United States should not be difficult to reach through planned summits between North and South, and between the North and the United States, in a bid to rein in the North's nuclear and missile programmes. "North Korea is expressing a will for a complete denuclearisation," Moon told reporters. "They have not attached any conditions that the US cannot accept, such as the withdrawal of American troops from South Korea. All they are expressing is the end of hostile policies against North Korea, followed by a guarantee of security." North Korea has defended its weapons programmes, which it pursues in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions, as a necessary deterrent against perceived US hostility. The United States stations 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War. North Korea has said over the years that it could consider giving up its nuclear arsenal if the United States removed its troops from South Korea and withdrew its so-called nuclear umbrella of deterrence from South Korea and Japan. South Korea announced on Wednesday that it is considering how to change a decades-old armistice with North Korea into a peace agreement as it prepares for the North-South summit this month. Reclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because the 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Moon also said he saw the possibility of a peace agreement, or even international aid for the North's economy, if it denuclearises. But he also said the summit had "a lot of constraints", in that the two Koreas could not make progress separate from the North Korea-United States summit, and could not reach an agreement that transcends international sanctions. "So first, the South-North Korean summit must make a good beginning, and the dialogue between the two Koreas likely must continue after we see the results of the North Korea-United States summit," Moon said. US CIA Director Mike Pompeo visited North Korea last week and met leader Kim Jong Un with whom he formed a "good relationship", US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday, ahead of a summit planned for May or June. North Korea meanwhile will hold a plenary meeting of its ruling party's central committee on Friday, state media KCNA said on Thursday. The meeting was convened to discuss and decide "policy issues of a new stage" to meet the demands of the current "important historic period", KCNA said.
Hawaii volcanoes park to reopen after monthslong eruption  [SEP]  The recent eruption of Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has quieted to the point that federal officials are ready to allow people back to the dramatically changed summit crater, which has quadrupled in size, lost all of its lava and collapsed downward so far that the Empire State Building could now fit inside. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park will reopen its main gates Saturday. Officials are bracing for long lines and crammed roads as visitors flock to see Kilauea's new landscape and the area where a well-known lava lake once bubbled. The reopening also coincides with National Public Lands Day, so admission is free. "We are projecting well over 5,000 people just in one day," Hawaii Volcanoes National Park acting spokeswoman Shanelle Saunders said. While interest is high, accommodations will be somewhat limited. Damage to the park closed about 30 percent of its former parking capacity. "We're really expecting long lines, and we hope people have plenty of patience when they're trying to get parking spaces," Saunders said. There's still no access to clean drinking water in the park, and the summit's Jaggar Museum remains closed, she added. The national park — normally the state's most-visited tourist attraction — has been closed for 135 days as volcanic activity caused explosive eruptions, earthquakes and the collapse of the famed Halemaumau crater. Ash clouds shot skyward from the summit crater and blanketed the region in volcanic debris. Kilauea has been active for decades. But the eruption that began in May has transformed both the park and the rural Big Island coastline that surrounds it. Outside the park, lava flows consumed entire neighborhoods, filled an ocean bay and created miles of new shoreline with fresh black sand beaches and jagged rocky outcrops. Inside the park, molten rock drained from the summit lava lake and vanished from view as the landscape underwent a monumental change. The summit crater floor sunk 1,500 feet (460 meters), and the overall Kilauea caldera widened — expanding from about 200 acres to over 1,000 acres, or more than 1 square mile, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. "This eruption was really unprecedented in the historic record," Ingrid Johanson, a research geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. "The changes we've seen at the summit are much more dramatic than anything that's happened in the last 200 years." The crater looks "completely different," Johanson said. "I think people are going to be really awestruck when they see it." However, one of the park's biggest draws — the radiant red light from the 2,000-degree lava lake that has been a Kilauea hallmark for over a decade — is completely gone. "There is no glow at all," Saunders said. "You can't even see your hand in front your face it's so dark in a lot of these areas. I mean, the stars right now are incredible, but there's actually no flowing lava." The park will be open 24 hours a day, but visitors should be careful at night because of new cracks in trails and walkways. "Even if people are really familiar with those trails, they may have changed since they've been here," Saunders said. Public access to the volcano remains limited because of damage to its infrastructure. But visitors can once again hike around some parts of the summit area and see the aftermath of the historic eruption. "The crater rim trail is open to a certain point," Saunders said. "And from there, they can see down into the crater itself." The theme of this year's National Public Lands Day is "resilience and restoration," said Hawaii Volcanoes National Park spokeswoman Jessica Ferracane, who noted that park repair work had been pointing toward a late-September reopening. "We really wanted to invite visitors back without them having to pay on that first day," Ferracane said. "The theme was so uncanny that we thought it would be a real good fit." Regardless of when the park reopened, officials expected big crowds. "If we reopened on a Monday in the middle of the school year, it would still be busy because people really want to come in and come back to the park," she said. While volcanic activity has slowed significantly in the past month and no lava is reaching the surface at Kilauea, scientists aren't ready to declare the latest eruption over. "There is still material that could feed into an eruption," Johanson said. "I definitely expect that lava will return one day."
Jurgen Kantner beheaded by Philippine militants, who release video of the German's horrifying murder  [SEP]  Blood-thirsty extremists belonging to the Abu Sayyaf group shouted 'Allahu Akbar' as they murdered their German prisoner in a grisly video that surfaced Monday. The brief video circulated Monday by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadi websites, is the first sign that the brutal militants proceeded with their threat to kill Jurgen Gustav Kantner in the southern Philippines after a Sunday ransom deadline lapsed. The video shows Kantner sitting in a grassy clearing and saying “Now he kill me” shortly before a masked militant beheads him with a curved knife. A few gunmen mutter “Allahu Akbar,” or God is great. Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Schaefer said German experts were evaluating the video to determine whether it is authentic, but that if it is, it’s “deeply shocking.” “It makes you question what can lead people to commit such a barbaric crime, but at the moment I’m not in a position to say whether the video’s authentic.” The militants had demanded a ransom of 30 million pesos ($605,000), officials said. The Philippine military said in November that the Abu Sayyaf claimed its gunmen had kidnapped Kantner and killed a woman sailing with him off neighbouring Malaysia’s Sabah state. Villagers reported finding a dead woman lying beside a shotgun on board a light blue yacht with the German flag and marked “Rockall” off Laparan Island in Sulu, the military said. The predominantly Muslim province is where ransom-seeking militants have held many hostages in jungle encampments. Kantner was also kidnapped by Somali pirates years ago.
The Irish Aviation Authority is investigating a recently spotted UFO  [SEP]  • Several pilots have seen bright objects move fast through the air over the Irish coast, and believed them to be UFOs. • Experts do not think it was aliens, but believe it was probably dust entering the atmosphere or a meteorite. On Friday, a British Airways pilot was completing a routine flight over the Irish coast when she saw something truly out of the ordinary. The pilot saw an unidentified flying object “moving so fast” that she felt compelled to call the local air traffic control to see if there were military exercises in the area, according to the BBC. The pilot, who was in the tail end of a journey from Montreal, Canada, to UK’s Heathrow airport, said the occurrence was unusual. “It came up on our left-hand side (rapidly veered) to the north, we saw a bright light and it just disappeared at a very high speed … we were just wondering. We didn’t think it was a likely collision course … (just wondering) what it could be,” she said, per CNN. Read more: 10 of the most notorious UFO sightings in the world – and the eerie stories behind them A pilot from a Virgin Flight said that he and his crew also saw “two bright lights at 11 o’clock (which) seemed to bank over to the right and then climb away at speed.” A third pilot told CNN that he saw something similar over Ireland months ago. He described having an “absolutely astronomical, like Mach 2 or something.” But experts don’t think it’s exactly out of this world. Despite the multiple sightings a series of months, experts just aren’t sure that the UFO is actually from another planet. Apostolos Christou, an astronomer from the Armagh Observatory and Planetarium, told the BBC that the pilots probably saw dust entering the atmosphere, which is often mislabeled as a shooting star. “It was most likely what are commonly called shooting stars,” he said. “It appears the matter was extremely bright so it must have been quite a large piece of material. I cannot say from the pilots’ description, but it could have been the size of a walnut or an apple.” Others think it could be something entirely different, though. One pilot told CNN that the object was probably a “meteor or some kind of object re-entry appears to be multiple objects following the same sort of trajectory,” which would account for the bright light. Christou said that re-entry is pretty common in the month of November. “It also appears there were bits coming off the object and flying past the airplane, that is also what you would expect if it was a particularly large rock from space hitting the atmosphere, it would tend to fragment,” he explained. In any case, a spokesperson for the Irish Aviation Authority told the BBC that they’re looking into this. “Following reports from a small number of aircraft on Friday 9 November of unusual air activity the IAA has filed a report,” they said in a statement. “This report will be investigated under the normal confidential occurrence investigation process.”
Tripoli airport reopens after closure due to clashes  [SEP]  TRIPOLI, Sept 26 (Reuters) - The only functioning airport in the Libyan capital Tripoli will reopen its airspace on Wednesday afternoon after clashes between rival militias forced it to close two weeks ago, the airport administration said. Mitiga airport was shut after rockets were fired in its direction. Flights were diverted to Misrata airport about 190 km (120 miles) east of Tripoli. "The carriers are expected to resume flights by the beginning of next week " the administration said. The facility, a former U.S military basei, closed twice this month due to indiscriminate shelling but no severe damages were reported. At least 115 people were killed and more than 380 wounded in the fighting that pitted the Seventh Brigade, or Kaniyat, from Tarhouna, a town 65 km (45 miles) southeast of Tripoli, against the Tripoli Revolutionaries' Brigades (TRB) and the Nawasi, two of the capital´s largest armed groups. Tripoli and western Libya are run by a U.N.-backed government mainly supported by armed groups, while eastern Libya is controlled by a rival administration. The country has been riven since Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011.
Germany: Girl, 14, killed; fugitive Iraqi suspect sought  [SEP]  BERLIN (AP) - German authorities said Thursday they are seeking a fugitive Iraqi asylum-seeker and have arrested a Turkish citizen over the rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl who went missing more than two weeks ago. The body of the girl, who had been missing since May 22, was found Wednesday on the outskirts of Wiesbaden. Prosecutors said Thursday that two men - a 20-year-old Iraqi and a 35-year-old Turkish citizen, both of whom lived at homes for asylum-seekers in the city - are suspected of raping and killing the girl on the evening she went missing. They believe the two then buried the body. Police said the Iraqi man, whom they identified as Ali Basar, appears to have left abruptly with his family last week, flying to Iraq via Istanbul. He was a suspect in a string of previous offenses in the area, including a robbery at knifepoint. He is believed to have arrived in Germany in October 2015, at the height of the migrant influx to Germany, and was appealing against the rejection of his asylum application. The Turkish suspect, who wasn't previously known to police, was arrested on Wednesday evening. Police said that, on Sunday, a 13-year-old refugee boy went to a police station in Wiesbaden, told officers that the girl had been raped and killed, and named the Iraqi as a possible perpetrator. Previous killings by asylum-seekers in Germany have fanned tensions over the influx of more than a million migrants in 2015 and 2016, an issue that helped the far-right Alternative for Germany enter parliament in last year's election.
James Franco Hosts Intimate Dinner for Golden Globe Nominated Actors  [SEP]  While many celebs were hitting up glittering galas last night in preparation for the 2018 Golden Globe Awards, James Franco hosted an intimate dinner on Saturday night with many of the men nominated for Best Lead Actor in a Motion Picture and Best Supporting Actor (in both Drama and Comedy or Musical categories) at the award show tonight. Armie Hammer, who is nominated for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture, Drama for Call Me By Your Name, documented the star-studded dinner with a A-list photo on Instagram and wrote, "Thank you #jamesfranco for hosting a dinner for all of the actors nominated for a Golden Globe... it was a special evening I’m sure none of us will forget."
Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron grin for 'le selfie'  [SEP]  It's not quite in the same league as the famous Oscars selfie tweeted by Ellen DeGeneres, but the wide smile on Theresa May's face shows she didn't seem too concerned. The Prime Minister beamed as she clearly enjoyed rubbing shoulders with media-savvy French President Emmanuel Macron in the age of Instagram and Twitter. The two heads of government packed a host of excited diplomats into the photo - dubbed "le selfie" - for an upbeat end to the UK-France summit. Mr Macron held the phone aloft and snapped Thursday night's photo at a reception of young leaders of the Franco-British council, held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. But it was the UK leader who got to post it to her own Twitter account, proclaiming that she was "proud to celebrate the extraordinary values and the talented people who link our countries". Mrs May is keen to burnish Britain's credentials as a big player on the world stage, but also her and her party's own image on social media. :: 'Be my guest' Macron's message to Britain But she is only the latest in a line of politicians to jump on the selfie bandwagon. Her predecessor David Cameron, former prime minister of Denmark Helle Thorning-Schmidt and US President Barack Obama once took a much-criticised selfie at the memorial service for Nelson Mandela. Mr Obama snapped another one up with his vice-president Joe Biden. While ex-White House hopeful Hillary Clinton had a selfie taken with Kim Kardashian. But who could forget Ed Miliband, former leader of the Labour party? The Doncaster North MP did manage to approach going "viral" for photobombing a group of girls on the London underground. And he even posed for one with The Only Way Is Essex Star, Joey Essex, an unlikely attendee at a Labour rally in Warrington in 2015.
UK charges 6 people in 1989 stadium disaster that left 96 dead  [SEP]  LONDON— British prosecutors charged a former senior police officer with manslaughter Wednesday as they announced the first criminal cases in the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster that left 96 people dead, many crushed against metal fences, and changed English soccer forever. The families of the victims have waged a decades-long quest to seek justice for their loved ones, who they believed were unfairly blamed in the April 15, 1989, tragedy. The initial deaths were ruled accidental — a ruling overturned in 2012 after a new, wide-ranging inquiry. Last year new inquests found the 96 had been unlawfully killed. Files were sent to prosecutors for criminal charges to be considered and they announced their highly anticipated decisions Wednesday. Those charged include the police commander on the day, David Duckenfield, who is accused of gross negligence manslaughter in the deaths of 95 men, women and children. Prosecutors declined to charge the manslaughter of the 96th casualty because he died four years after the fateful match. The former chief of South Yorkshire Police, Norman Bettison, is charged with misconduct in public office for lying about the disaster and its aftermath. Graham Henry Mackrell, the secretary and safety officer for the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club at the time, was charged with failing to carry out health and safety duties. Peter Metcalf, the attorney for the South Yorkshire Police, was charged with acting “with intent to pervert the course of public justice” relating to changes in witness statements during an inquiry into the tragedy. Former Chief Superintendent Donald Denton and former Detective Chief Inspector Alan Foster were charged for their involvement in the same matter. “Criminal proceedings have now commenced and the defendants have a right to a fair trial,” said Sue Hemming, the head prosecutor for special crime and counter terror. “It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.” The tragedy at the stadium in Sheffield unfolded when more than 2,000 Liverpool soccer fans flooded into a standing-room section behind a goal, with the 54,000-capacity stadium already nearly full for the match against Nottingham Forest. The victims were smashed against metal anti-riot fences or trampled underfoot. Many suffocated in the crush. At the time, hooliganism was common, and there were immediate attempts to defend the police and blame rowdy Liverpool fans — a narrative that the Hillsborough families have challenged for decades. The original inquest recorded verdicts of accidental death. But the families challenged it and pressed for a new inquiry. They succeeded in getting the verdicts overturned in 2012 after a far-reaching inquiry that examined previously secret documents and exposed wrongdoing and mistakes by police. The Hillsborough disaster prompted a sweeping modernization of stadiums across England. Top division stadiums were largely transformed into safer, all-seat venues, with fences around fields torn down. British Prime Minister Theresa May says this is a “day of really mixed emotions” for families of the fans who died, but that justice is moving forward “after so many years of waiting.” Among them was Barry Devonside, who lost his son Christopher in the disaster. He insisted it was “only right and proper that we fought for our loved ones.” “I was frightened we were going to be let down again,” he told Sky News. “We have been smacked in the face on a number of occasions. The families have acted with the utmost of dignity.”
“The Fight of Our Lives”: Young, Undocumented and Anxiously Awaiting President Trump  [SEP]  Diego Mancha avoided election-night watch parties Tuesday. Instead, he sat in his living room glued to the TV, anxiously surfing the channels. “I just didn’t want to be around people,” he says. “I was just too nervous.” It felt like every time he landed on the news, another key state had gone for Donald Trump. His stomach started to hurt.Undocumented immigrants like Mancha—the kind who were brought to this country as young children, who went to high school here, who are virtually indistinguishable from any other American twenty-something—had a lot riding on this election. Not only did president-elect Trump jumpstart his campaign with a potent strain of anti-immigrant rhetoric (calling Mexicans “rapists” in one of his earliest speeches), but he vowed to deport even more immigrants than did President Barack Obama, who himself earned the title “deporter-in-chief” due of the record number of people removed on his watch.But even with that very mixed legacy, there was some small semblance of progress under Obama. Young immigrants like Mancha mobilized and forced the administration to act unilaterally when comprehensive immigration reform (which Obama promised and failed to deliver during his first term) became a non-starter in Congress. Through an executive order dubbed Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (or DACA), Obama shielded some 800,000 young immigrants like Mancha from deportation and provided them permits to legally work. They call themselves “dreamers,” a throwback to the “DREAM Act” legislation that Congress wouldn’t pass.It seems very likely those protections will end under Trump, who has vowed to kill DACA and, during one presidential debate, even hinted at mass deportation squads. In seven years, the Obama Administration deported some 2 million people. Trump vows to deport that many just within his first year in office. On election night, as he watched state after state turn red for Trump, Mancha remembered what the candidate had said about “dreamers” like himself: “They have to go.”The anxiety among immigrant communities is widespread. RAICES executive director Jonathan Ryan, whose San Antonio nonprofit provides legal services to asylum-seeking women and children, said the waiting room at his office has been filled with people since Wednesday. “It’s not just undocumented people, but immigrants of every status,” he says. “It’s a reflex of fear.”Some advocates had hoped the hulking system of mass deportation and immigrant detention that had already developed under the Obama Administration might start to scale back in the coming months and years. The for-profit prison corporations that grew fat off immigrant detention were finally being phased out of the federal prison system – a decision many hoped that federal immigration officials would soon make as well. The feds’ practice of detaining and rapidly deporting asylum-seeking women and children has come under intense and growing criticism from humanitarian, non-profit, and even internal government watchdog groups.People like Cristina Parker with Grassroots Leadership, which advocates for immigrants detained in South Texas’ sprawling detention complex, are now frightened of what might happen when Trump seizes the reins of that system. “In my wildest dreams, president Obama would dismantle everything he’s built before he leaves office,” Parker says. “As bad as it was under him and as much as we fought him, handing the keys over to a fascist who has pledged to deport 2 million people in a year is unconscionable, irresponsible.” Like many immigration advocates, Parker says people have been calling her all week asking what they should do. “We don’t have an answer,” she says, “and that feels very scary. It’s been demoralizing and frightening.”Carolina Canizales says undocumented immigrants like her can’t afford to give Trump the benefit of the doubt. “When I listened to the campaign, what I heard is that he wants to deport people like me,” says Canizales, a UTSA graduate student who was brought to San Antonio from Mexico when she was just a child. “I’m angry, I’m panicked, I don’t know what’s going to happen now.”The past several years haven’t been easy, but activists like Canizales did manage to force piecemeal reforms. With sustained pressure from advocates, two years ago the Obama Administration said it would shield millions more immigrants from deportation. That policy, however, will now basically wither away in litigation Canizales expects the next several years to be even more trying. “This calls for great resilience for our communities,” she says. “We’re ready to fight….basically it’s the fight of our lives. We’re going to be tested like never before.”“I don’t see myself not living in San Antonio,” she says. “I grew up here. I have friends here. It’s beautiful to be a part of this country. I don’t want to leave that. So, yeah, whatever it takes.”
Clinton returns to tightening White House race  [SEP]  Hillary Clinton returned Thursday to the campaign fray in a tightening race against Republican Donald Trump, who released new details of his physical fitness in response to the health scare that sidelined his rival. Seeking to turn the page after her poorly handled bout with pneumonia, Clinton was headed to North Carolina and then the US capital Washington as she resumed the White House race after a three-day convalescence. Asked how she was feeling, the 68-year-old former secretary of state replied: "I am doing great, thank you so much!" Clinton was taken ill Sunday during a 9/11 memorial ceremony in New York where she was seen stumbling limp-legged into her vehicle, an episode that raised tough questions about her campaign's transparency. With the candidates' health suddenly at the forefront of the campaign, Clinton looked to head off further scrutiny by releasing new medical records Wednesday indicating that she was "fit to serve" as president. The disclosure came as the media-savvy Trump, 70, teased new health data of his own during the taping of a medical chat show, before publishing it Thursday in full. The one-page letter from his long-time doctor lists various lab results, including for cholesterol, blood pressure and liver and thyroid function -- all deemed to be within the normal range. While Trump is shown to be overweight, with a body mass index of 29.5, his doctor Harold Bornstein declared the Republican nominee to be "in excellent physical health." Trump had made a point of refraining from harsh attacks on his convalescent rival -- but the candidates were quick to resume their jousting. Team Trump included a veiled jab at Clinton in a statement accompanying his health update: "We are pleased to disclose all of the test results which show that Mr Trump is in excellent health, and has the stamina to endure -- uninterrupted -- the rigours of a punishing and unprecedented presidential campaign." While addressing the Economic Club of New York, Trump slammed the policies of Clinton and President Barack Obama as having doubled the national debt as he promised his presidency would bring about "an American economic revival." Recent opinion polls show the gap between the two narrowing with less than seven weeks before Election Day. A CBS News/New York Times survey found Clinton had just a two-point edge (46 to 44 per cent) over Trump in a two-way matchup among likely voters. Among registered voters, the Democratic nominee was five points ahead, at 46 to 41 per cent. When third party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein were included, the race was tied among likely voters at 42 per cent each. A Quinnipiac University poll out Wednesday found that Clinton edged Trump 41 per cent to 39 per cent when third party candidates were factored in.
Knights of Malta: Pope writes to stress order's sovereignty  [SEP]  ROME (AP) — The Knights of Malta say Pope Francis has written to their leaders stressing the sovereignty of the ancient Catholic lay order, following a condom scandal linked to the order’s charitable work. The order’s Sovereign Council in Rome on Saturday accepted the resignation of Grand Master Fra’ Matthew Festing, who had sacked the order’s foreign minister, Albrecht von Boeselager. The minister was removed as grand chancellor following revelations that condoms were distributed in Myanmar under his watch. The Vatican intervened on the minister’s behalf. On Saturday, the council scrapped the disciplinary measures against von Boeselager, who resumes his post. The Knights say Francis in his letter Friday stressed the order’s sovereignty. Until Festing’s successor is elected, Fra’ Ludwig Hoffmann von Rumerstein serves as its interim leader. Comments WTOP is now using Facebook as our comment platform. Need help? Email us
Asteroid named after Freddie Mercury  [SEP]  The Queen frontman, who sang the famous words, "I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky," from the song "Don't Stop Me Now," was honored by the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Center (IAU). The center renamed Asteroid 17473 after him, which was discovered in 1991 -- the year of his death. It was announced by Queen guitarist Brian May in Switzerland during an event to remember the iconic singer. "This is to recognize Freddie's outstanding influence in the world," he said. The asteroid can be found in the main Asteroid Belt, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. "It's a dark object -- rather like a cinder in space. Viewed from the Earth it is more than 10,000 times fainter than you can see by eye, so you need a fair sized telescope to see it," May said. The IAU said Mercury was given the honor because 'his distinctive sound and large vocal range were hallmarks of his performance style, and he is regarded as one of the greatest rock singers of all time.' Asteroid 17473 Freddiemercury is located in the main Asteroid Belt. Joel Parker of the Southwest Research Institute, who issued the Certified of Designation, said the asteroid was originally named '1991 FM3', so when a proposal to name an asteroid after the singer was received, the IAU selected it 'partly due to the 'FLM' in the designation' "Even if you can't see Freddiemercury leaping through the sky, you can be sure he's there - 'floating around in ecstasy', as he might sing, for millennia to come," Parker said.
Cheetah numbers crashing; extinction possible  [SEP]  The world's fastest land animal could be sprinting toward extinction, a new study reports Monday. Only about 7,100 cheetahs are left in the wild on Earth, scientists say in the study. This is the best estimate yet of the global cheetah population, according to study lead author Sarah Durant of the Zoological Society of London. Most of the decline has been in the past 100 years. The current number is down from an estimated 100,000 at the end of the 19th century, the National Wildlife Federation reports. The remaining cheetahs live mainly in Africa, although there is also a small population hanging on in Iran. "The population is in decline," Durant said, noting that of the 18 groups of wild cheetahs that scientists have studied in Africa, 14 were decreasing. For instance, Zimbabwe's cheetah population has plummeted from 1,200 to about 170 animals in just 16 years, representing an astonishing loss of 85% of the country's cheetahs. "Given the secretive nature of this elusive cat, it has been difficult to gather hard information on the species, leading to its plight being overlooked," Durant said. "Our findings show that the large space requirements for cheetah, coupled with the complex range of threats faced by the species in the wild, mean that it is likely to be much more vulnerable to extinction than was previously thought. "We need to uplist cheetah threat status from vulnerable to endangered," she added. The group that oversees these listings is the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which maintains the Red List of Threatened Species. About 77% of cheetahs live outside of wildlife reserves and other protected areas, the study said. This requires governments and villages to promote tolerance for a carnivore that sometimes hunts livestock, the Associated Press said. Besides habitat loss, cheetahs face attacks from villagers, loss of antelope and other prey that are killed by people for their meat, an illegal trade in cheetah cubs, the trafficking of cheetah skins and the threat of getting hit by speeding vehicles. Scientists estimate the cheetah has been driven out of 91% of its historic range. The study appeared in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Other groups involved in the study were the Wildlife Conservation Study and Panthera.
Former aide denied bail in Netanyahu fraud inquiry: police  [SEP]  An Israeli court on Monday extended the remands of a former aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a top businessman, both linked to cases of suspected fraud against the premier, police said. Tel Aviv magistrates court remanded Nir Hefetz, a former media adviser to the Netanyahu family, and Shaul Elovitch, the controlling shareholder of telecoms group Bezeq, until Sunday, a police statement said. The two men were among seven suspects arrested last week as fraud suspicions against Netanyahu snowballed. Police suspect Elovitch was given business concessions in return for Netanyahu receiving good press on Walla!, a news website he owns. Hefetz is alleged to have acted as a messenger between Netanyahu and Bezeq and Walla! officials. He is also suspected of trying to bribe a retired judge to block a probe into the prime minister's wife, Sara Netanyahu, over alleged misuse of public funds. Police have questioned the premier seven times since the beginning of 2017, and last month said there was sufficient evidence to charge him for graft, fraud and breach of trust in two cases. In one, he and family members are suspected of receiving one million shekels ($285,000, 230,000 euros) of luxury cigars, champagne and jewellery from wealthy personalities in exchange for financial or personal favours. In the other case, investigators suspect the premier of trying to reach an agreement with the owner of Yediot Aharonot, a top Israeli daily newspaper, for more favourable coverage. Israeli media said police would question him on the Bezeq affair for the first time on Friday. He would also reportedly face interrogation as a witness in suspected corruption around Israel's purchase of three submarines from German industrial giant ThyssenKrupp. The cases have fuelled speculation he could be forced to step down or call an early election but Netanyahu says he is innocent of any wrongdoing. Bezeq CEO Stella Handler and Elovitch's wife Iris were released from custody to house arrest Monday and son Or Elovitch was freed on bail, police said. Eli Kamir, another former Netanyahu adviser arrested last week, is to appear before a remand hearing on Wednesday. Shlomo Filber, a Netanyahu ally for more than 20 years and former director general of the communications ministry, was freed last week after agreeing to turn state's witness in exchange for avoiding jail, police said. He is suspected of mediating between Netanyahu and Elovitch and promoting regulatory changes worth millions to Bezeq. There was a new twist on Monday when the justice ministry promised a fast-track review of reports that another judge, Ronit Poznanski-Katz, and a National Securities Authority investigator colluded in remand decisions on the Bezeq case suspects. The suspicions were revealed late Sunday on private TV channel 10 News which showed what it said were screen shots of text messages in which the investigator said that his side would ask for Stella Handler and Iris Elovitch to be held for a further "few days," and told the judge she could "really, definitely give two days." "I'll try and look appropriately surprised," she allegedly replied. Israeli public radio said that when asked by journalists to comment on the allegations during a parliamentary meeting of his Likud party Netanyahu just laughed. Poznanski-Katz was replaced by another judge at Monday's hearing and the justice ministry said in a statement that its complaints department would "assemble the material" and decide whether to pursue the allegations further by Tuesday afternoon. Public radio said that by law the ministry could have taken up to a year to publish such a decision.
This is what happens now Article 50 has been triggered  [SEP]  Britain will take the first step on its "momentous journey" to a future outside the European Union when Theresa May launches divorce proceedings that will bring to an end a relationship of more than 40 years. The Prime Minister has signed the letter that starts the formal exit process and the historic document will be hand-delivered by a senior diplomat to EU chiefs. It will mark the start of complex and contentious negotiations that put the UK on course to break its ties with the Brussels club by the end of March 2019. Mrs May will urge the country to "come together" as she looks to the heal the deep wounds caused by a referendum campaign that left the UK mired in division. The PM's top team will gather around the Cabinet table at No 10 on Wednesday morning as she updates them on the content of the letter formally invoking Article 50. Article 50 is a plan that any country that wishes to exit the European Union must follow. It was created as part of the Lisbon treaty - an agreement which was signed by all the EU states in 2007 and which came into force in 2009. Before this treaty there was no formal way for a state to leave the EU. On Monday, Theresa May announced she will formally begin proceedings next Wednesday. In order to trigger Article 50 the PM will send a letter to the President of the European Union - Donald Tusk, who is also the former President of Poland. The two-year process means Britain should officially be out of the EU no later than April, 2019. The UK voted for Brexit in June 2016, why is the Prime Minister only starting the process now? The Leave victory in the referendum led to David Cameron's downfall as Prime Minister and he said the decision on Article 50 should be left to his successor. Theresa May set the end of March 2017 as her preferred deadline, allowing the government time to make preparations for the talks. Her hands were also tied, after the government lost a legal battle, which ruled she had to wait until Parliament gave her permission to start the Brexit process. What happens now Article 50 has been triggered? The terms of the exit will be negotiated, they will be overseen by Theresa May and led by David Davis, the Secretary for State for Exiting the EU. The UK is currently part of the single market - this is an agreement designed to make it easier for countries in the EU to buy and sell things with one another. But once the UK leaves the EU this will no longer be case, according to the PM. The UK and the EU will need to work out how they do business together once it is no longer a member state. There are currently around three million people from the EU living, working or studying in the UK and around two million Brits doing the same in other EU countries. Leaders will need to decide whether these people will be able to stay where they are or if this will change. As it stands British laws and European laws are closely connected. The UK will need to decide and negotiate which ones it wants to keep and which ones it doesn't. This may take some time given how linked they are. So is the UK is still in the EU? There is still a lot of work to be done on a "divorce agreement" unpicking decades of co-operation between the UK and the EU. Article 50 states that the treaties relating to EU membership will remain in force until a withdrawal agreement is signed or, failing that, two years from the notification of intent to withdraw. That two-year deadline can be extended, but only if the other 27 EU leaders unanimously agree to grant extra time. Can the UK change its mind? That's a big question, and one with no clear answer, partly because the Article 50 process has never been used before. Lawyers on both sides in the legal battle through the courts said once Article 50 had been invoked it was irrevocable. But Lord Kerr - the diplomat who drafted Article 50 - has suggested a country could change its mind. EU President Donald Tusk has also suggested that abandoning Brexit could be an option, claiming that other EU leaders would be sympathetic and "if we have a chance to reverse this negative process, we will find allies". What will happen to Brits in Europe? We'll have to wait and see. In the worst case scenario, they would lose reciprocal access to healthcare services and benefits and face being forced to return home. However the UK Government has said it does not want to see this happen. What will happen to EU citizens in the UK? Similarly, the European Commission has said it wants to safeguard the rights of EU citizens currently living in the UK. In his speech, Mr Barnier said he wanted to remove uncertainty. "This uncertainty is first and foremost that of the four and a half million citizens: • The Polish students who have access to British universities under the same conditions as British students; • The British pensioners who are resident in Spain and who benefit from healthcare under the same conditions as Spanish pensioners • The Romanian nurses and doctors who contribute to the quality of healthcare in the United Kingdom; • Or the engineers from Italy, Germany or elsewhere, who chose to work in the United Kingdom, just like the thousands of British people who have made the same choice to work in Berlin, Rome or Vienna." How will Article 50 affect the pound? It hasn't been good so far. The pound has lost a quarter of its value against the dollar since the referendum. What is the pound to Euro exchange rate? As of Tuesday night, it was £1 to 1.15 Euro. What does Article 50 say? It is made up of five paragraphs. It says that any member state can decide to withdraw from the EU; that it has to notify the European Council of its intention and negotiate arrangements for its withdrawal; that it has two years to negotiate that withdrawal; and that it can't take part in internal discussions about its departure. How will the UK and EU deal with each other after Article 50 is triggered? That's complicated as well. We will still formally be a member. We will still pay contributions to the EU budget. We will still have a vote. But we are on our way out. And we're likely to be excluded from many key discussions about the EU's future.
Australian Open 2018, stats preview: A look at the numbers behind Roger Federer and Marin Cilic's title clash  [SEP]  Melbourne: Even by Roger Federer's standards, his path to a 30th grand slam final has been a breeze but things are about to hot up as Croatian Marin Cilic prepares to try to stop the Swiss claiming a sixth Australian Open title on Sunday. Federer has only been extended past the two-hour mark twice in reaching his seventh final in Melbourne and even those two matches this week against unseeded Marton Fucsovics and Tomas Berdych were relatively straightforward straight-sets wins. Here's a look at some of the interesting facts and figures ahead of the much-awaited final: Roger Federer and Marin Cilic will be playing each other in their second Grand Slam final. The Swiss great breezed past the Croatian in straight sets at last year's Wimbledon final but a tearful Cilic played in pain from a nasty foot blister. He had previously conquered Federer in three sets in the semi-finals on the way to his 2014 US Open triumph. Overall, Federer leads 8-1, and 3-1 at Slams. Cilic is the first Croatian man or woman to play in an Australian Open final and is bidding to become the country's first multiple Major winner ahead of Goran Ivanisevic and Iva Majoli, who won one each. Ivanisevic has played in more major finals — four to Cilic's three. If Federer wins the final in straight sets he will equal Bjorn Borg and Rafael Nadal for most Grand Slam titles at three without dropping a set through the tournament. It would be the second time for Federer at the Australian Open after powering through the 2007 event without losing a set. Age shall not weary them Federer at 36 is bidding to win a third major title after turning 35. Australian great Ken Rosewall is the only other man to have won a Slam title after his 35th birthday in the post-1968 Open Era, at 37 years old in the 1972 Australian Open. Federer and Cilic practised together last month when they discovered, by accident, they were holidaying together in the Maldives. “It was just the two of us and we were both looking for a hitting partner and it happened that we were there,” Federer said. "We actually went to practice twice for 45 minutes. It was great fun. No coaches, no nothing, just the two of us on the court hitting balls. It was just nice and laid-back." Federer is aiming to add to his five Australian Open titles and in the process win a record 20th Grand Slam. It will be his seventh decider at Melbourne Park, a feat no one else has achieved. The Swiss great began his year at the Hopman Cup and won all four of his singles matches, putting him on a 10-match unbeaten streak. He will be the third oldest man to contest the Melbourne Park final and has extended his record for most Grand Slam final appearances to 30. Rafael Nadal is next with 23. The towering Croat, one of the tallest men on tour at 6 feet 6 inches, won his first major title at the 2014 US Open, defeating Kei Nishikori in the final. He is at a career-high in the rankings and by beating Kyle Edmund in the semis will rise to No 3 in the world. Nicknamed "Chila", he made the final at Wimbledon last year, losing to Roger Federer and won at the event in Istanbul to go with five semi-final appearances. He warmed up for the Australian Open by making the semi-finals in Pune. His previous best at Melbourne Park was the last four in 2010.
Sweden brings back conscription amid Russia fears  [SEP]  STOCKHOLM: Sweden is to reintroduce compulsory military service, seven years after abandoning it, to respond to global security challenges including Russia's assertive behaviour in the Baltic Sea region, Stockholm said on Thursday (Mar 2). "We are in a context where Russia has annexed Crimea," Swedish Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist told AFP, adding: "They are doing more exercises in our immediate vicinity." Sweden has had a professional army, staffed by volunteers, since 2010. "We saw that our units could not be filled on a voluntary basis. A decision had to be taken to complement the (volunteer) system which is why we are reactivating conscription," Hultqvist said. A non-NATO member, Sweden has not seen armed conflict on its territory in two centuries. It put conscription on hold in 2010 after it was deemed an unsatisfactory way of meeting the needs of a modern army. In the past two decades the military's budget has been slashed as its mission was revamped to focus more on peacekeeping operations abroad and less on the country's defence. But in recent years, concerns have risen about Russia's intentions in the region - with alarms bells ringing after Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014, experts noted. "The new security situation is also a reality, partly in the form of Russian power politics which has long been underestimated and downplayed," Wilhelm Agrell, a security expert at Lund University, told AFP. Since the winter of 2014, "we've seen Russia as expansive and prepared to use violence to benefit its own interests," Agrell said. But, "today Sweden has neither the possibility nor the political will to stay away from a conflict" in the Baltic Sea region, he added. In June 2015, US think tank Cepa published a report claiming Russia had held exercises with 33,000 troops aimed at practising an invasion of Sweden's Baltic Sea island of Gotland, among other sites. Just three months earlier, the Swedish government had decided to remilitarise Gotland, where the last barracks had been decommissioned in 2005. Around 150 men have been stationed there since September last year. Russian fears also came to the fore in October 2014, when Sweden launched a massive but unsuccessful hunt for a foreign submarine - suspected to be Russian - in the Stockholm archipelago over an eight-day period. Sweden first introduced compulsory military service in 1901 but halted it in 2010 and replaced it with a volunteer army. But a military career had little appeal to generations of Swedes who had never set foot inside barracks. Thursday's decision by the minority Social Democratic-led government means all Swedes - male and female - born in 1999 or later will be eligible for conscription as of Jul 1, 2017. Mandatory military service, which will last for 11 months, will begin Jan 1, 2018. As of Jul 1, all Swedes born after 1999 will be contacted and asked to answer a questionnaire. Based on their answers, 13,000 people will be mobilised. Of those, only 4,000 will be called up each year after Jan 1, 2018. For the first time, conscription will apply to women. "It's very important to emphasise that military service is for girls and guys," Hultqvist said. "It is important for the military to have a gender equal profile," he added. The reactivation of conscription is supported by both the government and right-wing opposition. In 2015, they had already agreed to increase military spending, granting the defence an additional 1.1 billion euros ($1.18 billion) over the period 2016-2020. On defence issues, Sweden has a close dialogue with neighbouring Finland, which in turn shares a 1,340-kilometre border with Russia. Sweden and Finland - the Nordic and Baltic region's only non-aligned countries - have recently stepped up their military cooperation with the US. That followed an increase in Russian military activity in the region, including several airspace violations and war planes allegedly flying without their identifying transponders. Russia has repeatedly warned Sweden and Finland against joining NATO, an issue regularly debated in both countries.
Director Paul Haggis Accused of Rape, Strongly Denies Everything  [SEP]  Director Paul Haggis has become the latest Hollywood figure to be accused of sexual misconduct, as four women come forward with claims against him, including assault and rape. The first woman, a publicist named in court papers as Haleigh Breest, filed a civil lawsuit against the director last month, which prompted three more women who were not named, to come forward with their allegations to Breest's New York City attorneys. They all told their stories to Breest's attorneys, and also to the Associated Press in separate interviews. Earlier today, Breest's attorneys filed an amended complaint that includes details from the three new accusers. Paul Haggis has denied these claims, filing a counter-complaint alleging that Breest and her lawyers sought $9 million to avoid any further legal action, which he claimed to be extortion. Here's what the director's lawyer, Christine Lepera, had to say in a statement about these allegations. Haleigh Breest claims the director raped her in 2013, after he lured her back to his Manhattan apartment following a film premiere. Breest accepted the director's offer for a ride home, but he instead brought her to his apartment in SoHo and invited her up for a drink. Fearing she would be insulting him if she denied the offer, she accepted, but once inside the director's apartment, he became very "sexually aggressive" and started kissing her. She stated that she felt "petrified and paralyzed" while the director reportedly said, "You're scared of me, aren't you?" He forced her into his bedroom where he forced her to perform oral sex on him then raped her. She woke up hours later and saw the director sleeping in another bedroom so she left. One of the other three unidentified women in the lawsuit also accused the director of raping her. This latest rape accuser was a 28 year old publicist who was working on a TV show that Paul Haggis was producing, back in 1996. The producer called her to review photos from the show that night in her office, and while she "thought it was odd," she agreed because he was "the ultimate boss." When Haggis arrived, everyone else at the office had left, and Haggis insisted on speaking in a back office. Once they got into the office, he immediately started kissing her. Here's what the unidentified accuser had to say in her interview with the Associated Press. Her account was corroborated by a friend who stated that in the weeks after the attack, the woman lost weight and seemed depressed, and when the friend asked what had happened, she told her that Paul Haggis had raped her. The friend also spoke to AP under the condition of anonymity because she still works in the entertainment industry and fears retribution. The accuser said she thought about going to the police but feared no one would believe her and her career would be over. She added that the #MeToo movement gave her the courage to come forward. The third accuser was in her 30s when she met with the director to pitch him about a television series, and while there were others in the room when she got there, when the director arrived, they quickly left. He proceeded to tell her about the arrangement he had with his wife about having affairs, when he came around the table and tried to kiss her. She ran to her car and while Paul Haggis gave chase, she managed to get to her car and escape before he caught up to her. The fourth accuser stated that the director forcibly tried to kiss her and then followed her into a cab in Canada in 2015. The accuser was in her late 20s and had known the director from film events. When the cab got to her apartment, he threw money at the driver and chased her before she was able to get inside and shut the door.

Israeli strike kills Hamas gunman as Gaza border simmers  [SEP]  An Israeli air strike killed a Hamas gunman and wounded one on Thursday, Palestinian medical officials said, as tensions across the Gaza Strip border simmered. Israel said the strike was launched in response to a bomb attack on a military vehicle on the Gaza frontier on Wednesday, in which there were no casualties. When gunmen shot at the aircraft, they were fired upon, the Israeli military said. Both sides are bracing for Palestinian demonstrations at the Gaza border on Friday – the third round of weekly protests that are scheduled to peak in mid-May, the 70th anniversary of Israel’s founding, which Palestinians mourn. The Israeli army has shot dead 30 of the Palestinian protesters, drawing international condemnation. Israel deems the sometimes violent demonstrations an effort by Hamas, the Islamist group that exercises de facto control over Gaza, to stoke Palestinian hostility toward it and provide cover for potential attacks across the border fence.
3 keys to North Carolina's Final Four win over Oregon  [SEP]  USA TODAY Sports breaks down the biggest difference-makers in Saturday's second Final Four game at Glendale, Ariz. 1. Rebounding, especially at the end In a pregame interview, Oregon coach Dana Altman made it clear his team is not better without injured frontcourt player Chris Boucher, a shot-blocking and rebounding presence that was finally felt in a game against a superior rebounding team in North Carolina on Saturday night. Still, the Ducks tied the Tar Heels 43-43 in the rebound battle but it was the second opportunities that the Tar Heels created for themselves that ultimately sunk the Ducks. Trailing by one with five seconds left, Oregon fouled Kennedy Meeks, a 63% free-throw shooter. He bricked both free throws, but Theo Pinson's offensive rebound saved UNC and sent Joel Berry II to the charity stripe. Surprisingly, he missed both. But again the Ducks failed on the glass, as a Meeks offensive rebound with four seconds left — and subsequent outlet pass to drain the clock — led to Oregon's demise. North Carolina won, but it's difficult to not look at it from the lens of Oregon losing it there at the end and on the glass. As big as Dylan Ennis (18 points) was in this game and as huge as Mr. March, Tyler Dorsey, has been all tournament, Brooks is the team's alpha dog and go-to guy down the stretch. So when he fouled out with 1:32 remaining it surely wasn't a good sign, especially considering he's hit two game-winning shots this season. But Brooks' early exit essentially summed up his lackluster performance. Brooks had 10 points on 2-for-11 shooting to go with five turnovers. Altman said after the game his team had "too many turnovers and bad decisions ... we didn't give ourselves a chance." Brooks, who felt like he was trying to do too much most of the night, was unspectacular when even a decent offensive performance could've helped lift Oregon in the one-point loss, especially when Berry wasn't his normal self, finishing 2-for-14 shooting from the floor. MORE FROM THE FINAL FOUR Speaking of Berry's awful game, Meeks and ACC player of the year Justin Jackson made up for it by combining for 47 points on 17-for-26 shooting. The rest of the team had 30 points on a dreadful 8-for-42 from the floor. And it wasn't just Berry who struggled. Isaiah Hicks was 1-for-12 from the field. It's only the second time ever that a team won an NCAA tournament game when two players took at least 10 shots and shot worse than 15% from the field — since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985. Jackson has been sensational all tournament and finished with 22 points off four three-pointers Saturday, while Meeks was the key player in the game with 25 points and 14 rebounds. HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE FINAL FOUR
Obama, Japanese PM Abe to seek reconciliation at Pearl Harbor  [SEP]  Putting 75 years of resentment behind them, the leaders of the United States and Japan are coming together at Pearl Harbor for a historic pilgrimage to the site where the bloodshed of surprise attacks thrust America into World War II. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit Tuesday with President Barack Obama is powerful proof that the former enemies have transcended the recriminatory impulses that weighed down relations after the war, Japan's government has said. Although Japanese leaders have visited Pearl Harbor before, Abe will be the first to visit the memorial that now rests on the hallowed waters above the sunken USS Arizona. For Obama, it's likely the last time he will meet with a foreign leader as president, White House aides said. It's a bookend of sorts for the president, who nearly eight years ago invited Abe's predecessor to be the first leader that Obama hosted at the White House. For Abe, it's an act of symbolic reciprocity, coming six months after Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima in Japan, where the U.S. dropped an atomic bomb in hopes of ending the war. "This visit, and the president's visit to Hiroshima earlier this year, would not have been possible eight years ago," said Daniel Kritenbrink, Obama's top Asia adviser in the White House. "That we are here today is the result of years of efforts at all levels of our government and societies, which has allowed us to jointly and directly deal with even the most sensitive aspects of our shared history." More than 2,300 Americans died on Dec. 7, 1941, when more than 300 Japanese fighter planes and bombers attacked. More than 1,000 others were wounded. In the ensuing years, the U.S. incarcerated roughly 120,000 Japanese-Americans in internment camps before dropping atomic bombs in 1945 that killed some 140,000 people in Hiroshima and 70,000 in Nagasaki. Abe will not apologize for Pearl Harbor, his government has said. Nor did Obama apologize at Hiroshima in May, a visit that he and Abe used to emphasize their elusive aspirations for a nuclear-free future. No apology needed, said 96-year-old Alfred Rodrigues, a U.S. Navy veteran who survived what President Franklin D. Roosevelt called a "date which will live in infamy." "War is war," Rodrigues said as he looked at old photos of his military service. "They were doing what they were supposed to do, and we were doing what we were supposed to do." After a formal meeting in the morning, Obama and Abe planned to lay a wreath aboard the USS Arizona Memorial, which is accessible only by boat. Then they'll go to nearby Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, where both leaders will speak. Obama and Abe signed off on the visit last month when they met in Peru on the sidelines of an economic summit. Though the parallels with Obama's Hiroshima visit are palpable, both governments said that one visit wasn't contingent on the other. Meanwhile, China criticized Abe's visit as an insincere attempt to absolve Japan of its wartime aggression. "Trying to liquidate the history of World War II by paying a visit to Pearl Harbor and consoling the dead is just wishful thinking on Japan's part," said Hua Chunying,a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman in Beijing, at a regular briefing. "Japan can never turn this page over without reconciliation from China and other victimized countries in Asia," she said. "Japanese leaders should stop being so evasive and dodging, and instead take a responsible attitude toward history and future, deeply and sincerely reflect upon the history of aggressive war, and draw a clear break with the past." Abe's visit is not without political risk given the Japanese people's long, emotional reckoning with their nation's aggression in the war. Though the history books have largely deemed Pearl Harbor a surprise attack, Japan's government insisted as recently as this month that it had intended to give the U.S. prior notice that it was declaring war and failed only because of "bureaucratic bungling." "There's this sense of guilt, if you like, among Japanese, this 'Pearl Harbor syndrome,' that we did something very unfair," said Tamaki Tsukada, a minister in the Embassy of Japan in Washington. "I think the prime minister's visit will in a sense absolve that kind of complex that Japanese people have." Since the war, the U.S. and Japan have built a powerful alliance that both sides say has grown stronger during Obama's tenure. There are questions about what the relationship will look like under President-elect Donald Trump. During the campaign, Trump suggested that Japan and South Korea should obtain nuclear weapons so the U.S. would no longer be burdened with costs of defending them, a disquieting notion in many Asian capitals. But after Trump's election, Abe became the first foreign leader to meet with him, sitting down in Trump Tower with the business mogul and Trump's daughter, Ivanka. Though no Japanese prime minister has visited the USS Arizona Memorial, former Japanese leader leader Shigeru Yoshida visited Pearl Harbor in 1951, six years after Japan surrendered. He stopped there on his way home from signing the San Francisco peace treaty with the U.S. and others, and paid a courtesy visit to the office of Adm. Arthur W.R. Radford. Other prime ministers have since visited Pearl Harbor and the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, known as Punchbowl.
Islamic State spokesman killed in Aleppo, group's news agency says  [SEP]  Islamic State says its spokesman has been "martyred" in northern Syria. The Islamic State-run Aamaq news agency said Tuesday that Abu Muhammed al-Adnani was "martyred while surveying the operations to repel the military campaigns against Aleppo," without providing further details. Islamic State has released several audio files online in which Adnani, a senior leader in the group, delivers fiery sermons urging followers to carry out attacks. The extremist group has suffered a string of defeats in recent weeks, including in Syria's northern Aleppo province, where Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels drove it out of the border town of Jarablus last week.

Bodies of missing sailors found by Navy divers in aftermath of ship collision near Japan  [SEP]  YOKOSUKA, Japan >> Navy divers found the bodies of missing sailors Sunday aboard the stricken USS Fitzgerald that collided with a container ship in the busy sea off Japan, the Navy said. Searchers gained access to the spaces that were damaged during the collision and brought the remains to Naval Hospital Yokosuka where they will be identified, the Navy said in a statement. Seven sailors had been missing, but Yoko Kato, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Navy in Yokosuka, said not all seven were recovered. She didn’t say how many were found. Japan’s coast guard officials said the sea and air search was still continuing at the site of the collision. The Navy said that the families were being notified and provided the support they need during “this difficult time.” The names of the sailors will be released after all notifications are made. Sixteen hours following the predawn Saturday collision, the damaged destroyer was pumping out water as it limped back to its home port in Yokosuka Naval Base south of Tokyo by sunset Saturday, its crew lined up on deck. The Philippine-flagged container ship was berthed at Tokyo’s Oi wharf, where officials began questioning crew members about the cause of the crash. At least three other crew members, including the captain, were injured in the crash, which damaged two berthing spaces, a machinery room and the radio room. Most of the more than 200 sailors aboard would have been asleep in their berths at the time of the collision. It wasn’t clear what caused the crash. Associated Press writers Mari Yamaguchi and Elaine Kurtenbach in Tokyo and Cathy Bussewitz and Jennifer Kelleher in Honolulu contributed to this report.
Authorities: Woman ’chained up like a dog’ inside container  [SEP]  ANDERSON, S.C. — A woman who had been reported missing along with her boyfriend in late August was found “chained up like a dog” inside a storage container, a South Carolina sheriff said Thursday. Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright told news outlets that deputies acting on a tip found her after hearing her banging on the container from the inside Thursday in the town of Woodruff, 80 miles northwest of the state capital of Columbia. Wright said she had a chain around her neck. He says she told deputies she had been kept in the container for two months and had been fed regularly. The sheriff said the container measured 30 feet by 15 feet by 10 or 12 feet. It was chained and locked. A message seeking additional comment from the sheriff’s office wasn’t immediately returned Thursday. Anderson Police Chief Jim Stewart said his department’s investigation into the disappearance of the woman and Charles Carver, her 32-year-old boyfriend, led authorities to the property near Woodruff where the woman was found. Carver is still missing. Stewart said more than a dozen search warrants were issued. “We got computer and cellphone records that ultimately led us to the area in Woodruff,” Stewart said. “We knew that was the last place that a cellphone tied to this case pinged.” The sheriff said a registered sex offender identified as Todd Christopher Kohlhepp has been arrested in connection with the incident. Wright said the woman, who worked for Kohlhepp, has told investigators that there may be other victims. “We’re trying to make sure that we don’t have a serial killer on our hands,” Wright said. Records indicate Kohlhepp is a licensed real estate agent as well as a licensed pilot. In 1986, he was convicted and sentenced to prison for kidnapping and dangerous crimes against children.
Shut for over 6 years, Syria's national museum reopens  [SEP]  Head of the General Directorate for Antiquities and Museums, Mahmoud Hammoud, said four of the five sections of the museum will be opened to showcase hundreds of archaeological findings that date back to the prehistoric, historical, classical and Islamic eras. He said some artifacts restored or seized by Syrian authorities will also be on display.
United States junked by Juncker as preferred EU trading partner  [SEP]  The head of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker failed to mention the United States in the list of countries Brussels wants to conclude trade agreements with in the coming years, during his speech to the European Parliament on Wednesday. “With the help of the European Parliament, we have just secured a trade agreement with Canada that will provisionally apply as of next week. We have a political agreement with Japan on a new economic partnership. By the end of the year, we have a good chance of doing the same with Mexico and South American countries. And today, we are proposing to open trade negotiations with Australia and New Zealand,” Juncker said. The European Commission’s term of office runs until October 31, 2019. Before Donald Trump’s election as the US President, Washington and Brussels were actively negotiating the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) trade agreement. Trump canceled the TPP agreement with Asian countries as he dislikes multilateral trade agreements. Talks on TTIP have stalled, too. In his speech, Juncker insisted Europe wants deals that would be profitable for the bloc, not only the other side. “Let me say once and for all: we are not naïve free traders. Europe must always defend its strategic interests,” he said. Relations between long-term allies America and Europe have strained in the last few months. Recently Washington unilaterally imposed sanctions against the Russian energy sector over alleged meddling in US presidential elections by Moscow. The EU said the sanctions could backfire on European countries working with Russia. Juncker didn’t mention the world’s second largest economy China as a preferred trade partner, either. He also hinted that Chinese acquisitions of European infrastructure should be checked more thoroughly. “If a foreign, state-owned, company wants to purchase a European harbor, part of our energy infrastructure or a defense technology firm, this should only happen in transparency, with scrutiny and debate,” Juncker said. China’s COSCO Shipping already has a majority stake in Greece’s biggest port, Piraeus, and a share of a terminal at Europe’s largest port, Rotterdam. Germany, France, and Italy praised Juncker’s speech on tighter oversight of foreign acquisitions of European property. "Europe and of course Germany are and will remain open to investment from abroad. But we need to prevent other states from taking advantage of our openness in order to push through their industrial policy interests," German Economic Affairs Minister Brigitte Zypries said in a joint statement with France and Italy. "The EU must be ready to stand up for its interests and protect itself - in particular when competition is not fair, and we are dealing with important national strategic interests," said French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire.
Italy earthquake: Rome subway evacuated amid tremors  [SEP]  Story highlights Nine aftershocks reported after initial quake "Catastrophic weather" blocking roads to some affected areas Rome (CNN) The metro system and some schools in Italy's capital, Rome, were evacuated Wednesday following a series of powerful earthquakes that struck the heart of the country. An initial 5.3-magnitude quake hit central Italy this morning 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) west-northwest of Amatrice, a town devastated by powerful temblors last year, the US Geological Survey (USGS) reported. While the epicenter was 90 kilometers northeast of Rome, the quake was felt strongly in the capital, sending people running from buildings in a panic. At least nine aftershocks have been reported since the initial quake, including one as strong as 5.7, and all at a shallow 10 kilometers deep or less, the USGS reported.

No more excuses on refugees, European Commission warns  [SEP]  To date, 3,936 people from Italy and 9,610 from Greece have been moved to safety -- 8% of the total European Union target. And so far just two member states, Malta and Finland, are on track to meet their resettling obligations. Hungary, Austria and Poland are still refusing to participate in the resettlement plan, due to end in September. Other Eastern European countries, such as the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Croatia and Slovakia, are only doing so on a limited basis, the commission said. How some European countries are tightening their refugee policies in September, describing it as an " Speaking at a press conference Thursday in Brussels, Belgium, Dimitris Avramopoulos, the EU commissioner of migration, home affairs and citizenship, cautioned that countries failing to meet their commitments would face fines extending beyond the end of the resettlement planin September, describing it as an " outstanding bill. "There are no more excuses for the member states not to deliver. It is possible and feasible to relocate all those who are eligible from Italy and Greece by September," Avramopoulos said. "It entirely depends on the political will and perseverance of member states to make it happen." Despite February setting a new monthly record with around 1,940 relocations, the current pace remains well below the European Council targets of at least 3,000 a month from Greece and 1,500 from Italy. "Responsibility cannot be fairly shared without solidarity. All our measures are interlinked, and member states cannot cherry-pick what they deliver on," Avramopoulos said, adding that the commission could launch proceedings leading to possible fines. A migrant boy wrapped in an EU flag arrives in Munich, Germany, in 2015. Conversely, the commission welcomed progress on resettlement by European countries. According to a commission statement, member states have "provided safe and legal pathways to 14,422 persons so far, over half of the agreed 22,504 under the EU resettlement scheme." That number includes 3,565 Syrians resettled through the EU-Turkey deal , a controversial agreement aimed at stemming the tide of migrants and refugees making their way from Turkey into Europe. Under the deal, the EU accepts one Syrian living in a Turkish camp for each migrant returned to Turkey in a "one-for-one" exchange. "To improve our management of migration we need to continue to implement our comprehensive approach -- from relocation and resettlement, to the operationalization of the European Border and Coast Guard and through continued engagement with Turkey," said Frans Timmermans, the European Commission's first vice president. Now, one year since the EU-Turkey deal was signed, average daily arrivals of refugees to the Greek islands are down to 43, from around 1,740 in 2016 . At the height of the refugee crisis in October 2015, daily crossings from Turkey to the Greek islands reached a staggering 10,000 in a single day.
2,500 jobs at risk as Maplin heads towards administration  [SEP]  Stricken electronics retailer Maplin, which has an outlet at the St George's retail park, is reportedly heading towards collapse. This puts 200 stores and some 2,500 jobs at risk in the UK. Talks had been underway with a number of retailers interested in taking on the Maplin business but these are understood to have failed. Its stores have been experiencing falling profits as consumers switch to online shopping. Without a buyer, Maplin, which is owned by Rutland Partners, looks likely to appoint administrators, reports the BBC. Administration means insolvency experts will take over the running of the business and seek to sell off assets to achieve the best deal for those owed money by Maplin. The outcome for stores and employees is unclear but a significant number of job losses are likely unless a buyer decides to take on the stricken business and retain some of Maplin's 200 branches. It is understood that consultancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers is likely to handle any administration process and subsequent sale.
Aussies grounded after Bali volcano erupts  [SEP]  Flights have resumed for holidaymakers travelling to and from Bali after ash from Indonesia's Mount Agung disrupted operations on Friday. Thousands of Australians had put their dreams of a Bali holiday on hold, but Virgin Australia and Jetstar have been able to resume normal flight schedules after Denpasar Airport reopened. Flying conditions have improved and in some cases relief flights have been added to normal schedules, the airlines announced on Saturday morning. Warnings still remain in place, lest the weather conditions change. "Volcanic activity is unpredictable, so please be aware that conditions can change rapidly," Jetstar said in a statement on Saturday morning. Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency said more than 8300 passengers worldwide had been affected. The regional volcanic ash advisory centre in Darwin said winds could carry the ash southwest toward Bali's international airport and Java - Indonesia's most densely-populated island. Mount Agung is about 70 kilometres northeast of Bali tourist hotspot Kuta. Its last major eruption was in 1963 and killed about 1200 people. Activity at the volcano was high in 2017 and forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of people. Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 250 million people, sits on the Pacific "ring of fire" and is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Local government seismologists monitor more than 120 active volcanoes.
USDA-FAS report: India sixth largest beef-consuming country in the world  [SEP]  HYDERABAD: Among all the hullabaloo revolving ‘beef’ in the country, a recently released report by the United States Department of Agriculture- Foreign Agricultural Service (USDA-FAS) has termed India one of the largest beef-consuming countries in the world. To be precise, the sixth largest after USA, China, European Union, Brazil and Argentina. The April 2017 figure of total domestic beef consumption in India stands at 2.4 million Metric Tonnes(MT), such that India’s domestic beef consumption figure is much higher than that of neighbouring Pakistan, a country to which, infamously, in 2015, beef eaters were advised to go by the Union Minister, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi. Pakistan’s beef consumption stood much lower than India at 1.7 million MT. India’s beef consumption is much higher than traditionally meat consuming nations like Russia(1.78 million MT) and Japan (1.22 million MT). USA’s consumption stands at 12.12 million MT and China’s at 8.01 million MT. Although beef has become a contentious issue in India since the past few years and incidents have occurred wherein people have been murdered and flogged in the name of beef, India’s beef consumption is on a rise. Domestic beef consumption in India was around 2 million MT in 2013 and in four years till April 2017 it has increased by 400 thousand MT. Same is the case with beef production. India’s beef production is fifth largest in the world after USA, Brazil, European Union and China. As per the USFDA-FAS report, India’s beef production increased from 3.8 million MT to 4.25 million MT in April this year, which is expected to grow to 4.35 million MT by October. USA’s production stands at 12 million MT and Brazil’s at 9.5 million MT. When it comes to beef exports, India continues to be the top most in world as it exported 1.85 million MT of beef by April 2017. Brazil comes second with 1.80 million MT. Beef exports have also seen an increase from 2013 when it was 1.76 million MT. Exports saw a steep hike in the year 2014, when it peaked to 2.08 million MT. India has almost 30 per cent of entire world’s cattle stock India’s cattle stock is also highest in the world at 303 million cattle heads, much above Brazil which comes second at 226 million cattle heads. India has almost 30 pc of the entire world’s cattle stock. Same is the case with calf crop as India has the highest number of calf crop at 68 million cattle heads.
Afghanistan: Deadly blasts target Kabul sports club  [SEP]  Twin bombings at a sports club in Kabul on Wednesday killed at least 20 people and wounded 70 others, the latest in a spate of deadly attacks in the Afghan capital. No immediate claim of responsibility was made for the blasts in Dasht-e-Barchi, home to many members of the mainly Shia Muslim Hazara ethnic minority that has been targeted in the past by members of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Images taken at the scene showed young men in torn wrestling kit helping the wounded onto vehicles to be taken to hospital. The first explosion was triggered by a suicide bomber and was followed by a car bomb shortly after, said interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani condemned the bombings. "An attack on civilians and media workers of the country is an attack on freedom of speech and crime against humanity," he said in a statement. A reporter and cameraman from Afghanistan's largest broadcaster, Tolo News, were killed in the second blast and four other local television crew were wounded, according to NAI, a group supporting open media in Afghanistan. Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanekzai said the second explosion hit as police were helping victims and a number of officers were wounded. Al Jazeera's Jennifer Glasse, reporting from Kabul, said the second bomb appeared to target first responders and journalists. "It has been a very deadly year here for journalists and for Afghans alike," Glasse said. On April 30, twin explosions in Kabul killed nine media workers and 16 other people. Social media users who purportedly witnessed the attack said the bomber killed the guards at the club before blowing himself up inside. He "detonated inside where a large number of athletes had gathered. There are a lot of dead and wounded", Mohammad Hanif said on Facebook. Wednesday's attack underlined the danger in Kabul as elections approach next month, as well as the threat facing the Hazaras - a Persian-speaking minority that has long faced discrimination. In mid-August, at least 34 people were killed in a suicide attack in front of an education centre in Dasht-e-Barchi, west of Kabul. ISIL - which has established a brutal reputation and which both the Western-backed government and the Taliban consider an enemy - claimed responsibility for that bombing.
Saudi king upends royal succession, names son as 1st heir  [SEP]  Saudi Arabia's King Salman on Wednesday appointed his 31-year-old son Mohammed bin Salman as crown prince, placing him firmly as first-in-line to the throne and removing the country's counterterrorism czar and a figure well-known to Washington from the royal line of succession. In a series of royal decrees carried on the state-run Saudi Press Agency, the monarch stripped Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who had been positioned to inherit the throne, from his title as crown prince and from his powerful position as the country's interior minister overseeing security. The newly announced Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman already oversees a vast portfolio as defense minister and head of an economic council tasked with overhauling the country's economy. He had previously been the second-in-line to the throne as deputy crown prince, though royal watchers had long suspected his rise to power under his father's reign might also accelerate his ascension to the throne. The young prince was little known to Saudis and outsiders before Salman became king in January 2015. He had previously been in charge of his father's royal court when Salman was the crown prince. The Saudi monarch, who holds near absolute powers, quickly awarded his son expansive powers to the surprise of many within the royal family who are more senior and more experienced than Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS.
Why Sports Direct Coughed Up $101 Million for Two Bankrupt US Retailers  [SEP]  Just days after Sports Direct took a 7.9 percent stake in Finish Line, the U.K.-based retailer took a more aggressive step to become competitive in the U.S. market. In a move that was widely anticipated, Sports Direct said on Friday it was granted approval by the Delaware Bankruptcy Court to buy two retailers out of bankruptcy: Eastern Mountain Sports and Bob’s Stores, both owned by Eastern Outfitters LLC. Sports Direct said it would pay a total of $101 million in cash for the deal, expected to close next month. The company said the acquisition of about 50 stores would “provide Sports Direct with a footprint in U.S. bricks-and-mortar retail and a platform from which to grow U.S. online sales.” Earlier this week the retail giant took a significant stake in Finish Line that had at least one market watcher speculating a takeover was on the horizon. “It appears to us that Sports Direct is actively making an effort to purchase Finish Line, despite the fact that no mention of an active position was mentioned in the [SEC] filing,” Susquehanna Financial Group LLP analyst Sam Poser wrote Monday. “The purchase of all of Finish Line would provide leverage for Sports Direct’s total operation as well as provide better vendor terms from the likes of Nike, Adidas, Under Armour and others.” Sports Direct, which was founded in 1982 by British billionaire Mike Ashley and now has 455 sports stores in the U.K., has rapidly expanded its interests in the American market. In January, the British retailer acquired stakes in Dick’s Sporting Goods and boosted its holdings in Iconix Brand Group. Before that, it had purchased 4.3 million shares in Iconix, or 9 percent of the troubled firm.
'Greatest show on Earth': Ringling Bros circus bows out after 146 years  [SEP]  The clowns, animal acts and acrobats of the storied Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey Circus took their final bow on Sunday, with a space-themed balancing act kicking off the farewell performance of the “greatest show on Earth” after 146 years. Capping a legacy that stretches back to the 19th-century showman PT Barnum, the circus bade adieu with a series of shows at the weekend at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York. Kenneth Feld, the chairman and chief executive of the circus owner Feld Entertainment Inc, said at the show: “It’s incredibly heartwarming to see all of you that have come out for the final performance.” He said more than 250 million people had seen Ringling’s shows – with the final one livestreamed on the Ringling website – and added: “It’s the people, it’s the spirit, the dedication, the perseverance of everyone that you’ll see here tonight that makes the impossible possible.” The finale, announced by Feld in January, came a year after the company bowed to pressure from animal rights activists and agreed to stop using elephants in its performances. A featured attraction for more than a century, the elephants had come to symbolise the Ringling Bros brand. Feld decided to fold its tent as a result of high operating costs combined with lower ticket sales. After phasing out the elephants, the owner said, the decline in attendance was “greater than could have been anticipated”. Ringling Bros continued to use tigers, lions, horses, dogs and camels, despite fierce criticism from Peta. The circus has long defended its treatment of animals as humane. The 13 Asian elephants used in Ringling’s two touring companies were retired to the company’s 200-acre (80-hectare) Center for Elephant Conservation in Polk City, Florida. Fewer than 40,000 Asian elephants remain in the wild. About 250 are in captivity in the US, 26 of which were born in the past 20 years at Ringling facilities.
Myanmar to free more than 8,000 prisoners in New Year amnesty  [SEP]  YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar began releasing more than 8,000 prisoners on Tuesday on humanitarian grounds under a presidential pardon, with most of those being released convicted of drug offences but with 36 people classified as political prisoners among them. The pardon, signed by newly elected President Win Myint, coincides with Myanmar's traditional new year celebrations and was aimed at promoting peace and the joy of the people, his office said in a statement. "To bring peace and pleasure to people's heart, and for the sake of humanitarian support, 8,490 prisoners from respective prisons will be pardoned," the Presidential Office said. Dozens of prisoners were set free later on Tuesday from Insein prison in Myanmar's main city of Yangon, greeted at the gates of the colonial-era jail by scores of relatives and friends. "I'm happy for this amnesty but I'm sorry for the other prisoners left behind," said Saw Wah Lay, a member of a political party affiliated with an ethnic Karen insurgent group, the Karen National Liberation Army. He said he had spent 13 years in Insein jail after being sentenced to death and a 95-year prison term for murder and other charges. "I hope they will be released soon because some of them are facing unfair charges without having done anything wrong," he told reporters. Two Reuters reporters, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, jailed in Myanmar were not included in the amnesty, according to Min Tun Soe, spokesman of Myanmar Prisons Department, citing ongoing legal proceedings against them. A court in Yangon has been holding preliminary hearings since January to decide whether the pair will be charged under the colonial-era Officials Secrets Act, which carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has made ending years of war between government forces and ethnic minority insurgents her top priority but the releases announced on Tuesday did not appear to include a significant number of people convicted for links to insurgencies. 'VERY GOOD NEWS' More than 6,000 of those being released were sentenced on drug charges, government spokesman Zaw Htay said on his Facebook page. He did not identify any of those being released but said nearly 2,000 were members of the military and police, jailed under the Military Act or Police Disciplinary Act. He did not elaborate. Zaw Htay also said 36 prisoners on a list issued by the human rights group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) were included in the amnesty. Hundreds of political prisoners have been released from Myanmar's jails in amnesties in recent years, including dozens freed in April 2016, days after Nobel laureate Suu Kyi's party took power following nearly 50 years of strict military rule. Before Tuesday's pardon, there were 240 political activists jailed or awaiting trial in Myanmar, the AAPP said. "This amnesty is very good news and we welcome and support it," said a representative of the group, Aung Myo Kyaw. "But there should not be a single political prisoner in a democratic country," he said. Suu Kyi, who spent years under house arrest, has said that releasing all remaining political prisoners was a top priority. She has faced criticism at home over slow economic growth and the stuttering peace process. Her government has also faced mounting international condemnation over a military operation against Rohingya Muslims that has sent nearly 700,000 members of the minority community fleeing to Bangladesh, according to U.N. figures. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Twitter on Monday she had met representatives of Reuters and prominent human rights lawyer Amal Clooney to discuss efforts for the release of the two Reuters reporters "jailed for doing their job". "Freedom of press & rule of law are the bases that democracies are built on & we hope Burmese authorities will realize the importance of this release to the int'l community," Haley wrote. Clooney has joined the legal team representing the two reporters, her office said last month. A Reuters spokesperson confirmed the meeting and said the company would continue to do all it could to secure the release of the two reporters.

Civilian casualties increase as Afghan troops battle Taliban - U.N.  [SEP]  Overall at least 1,601 civilians were killed and 3,565 wounded in the war in the first six months of 2016, the United Nations reported, as insurgent groups like the Taliban try to topple the government installed in Kabul after the 2001 U.S.-led military intervention. Anti-government groups, the largest of which is the Taliban, accounted for at least 60 percent of non-combatants killed and wounded. Twin blasts on Saturday were claimed by Islamic State militants and killed at least 80 people and injured more than 230, most of them civilians. Those numbers are not included in the U.N. report, but the attack highlighted its finding that suicide bombings and complex attacks are now harming more civilians than are roadside bombs. Casualties caused by pro-government forces increased 47 percent over the same period last year, the United Nations said. Afghan forces were responsible for 22 percent of casualties overall, and the international troops remaining in the country caused 2 percent, while 17 percent could not be attributed to one side or the other. For the first time, the Afghan air force killed or wounded more civilians in its operations than did air strikes carried out by international forces, the United Nations reported. The top U.S. military official told reporters in Washington that while the Afghan security forces were taking measures to reduce the risk of civilian casualties, the increase in casualties caused by them was "natural" since it was the first year the air force had flown operations in support of ground forces. "That is one of the reasons why we are continuing in our advise, assist effort," Marine General and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford said at a news conference with U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter. U.N. officials said they had heard more commitments by both sides, but few effective actions to improve protection of civilians. "Every civilian casualty represents a failure of commitment and should be a call to action for parties to the conflict to take meaningful, concrete steps to reduce civilians' suffering and increase protection," Tadamichi Yamamoto, the top U.N. official in Afghanistan, said in the report. "Platitudes not backed by meaningful action ring hollow over time. History and the collective memory of the Afghan people will judge leaders of all parties to this conflict by their actual conduct." More than 1,500 children were killed and wounded by the war, in the highest toll ever recorded in a six-month period by the United Nations. Most civilians were caught up in ground clashes between the two sides as the Taliban increasingly threatened population centres and government troops went on the offensive following the withdrawal of most international combat troops in 2014. Ground engagements accounted for 38 percent of casualties, followed by complex and suicide attacks at 20 percent, U.N. investigators found. Casualties caused by roadside bombs decreased dramatically, by 21 percent, a drop the United Nations attributed to changes in the nature of the conflict, as well as better bomb-detection by the government. The report was sharply critical of the Taliban, who "continued using indiscriminate tactics, including carrying out devastating complex and suicide attacks in civilian areas". Islamic State, a group that has made some limited inroads in Afghanistan, accounted for 122 casualties in the first six months of 2016 compared with 13 casualties attributed to it in the same period last year. The increasing number of casualties caused by the government, meanwhile, was largely due to wide use of heavy explosives during ground battles, investigators reported. Aerial operations by the Afghan air force in 2016 caused more than triple the number of civilian casualties during the same period in 2015, according to the report, as new aircraft and weapons were deployed. At least 111 civilians, 85 of them women or children, were killed or wounded by Afghan helicopters and warplanes. On June 13, for example, Afghan helicopters fired rockets and machineguns at a funeral ceremony for a Taliban member, killing or wounding at least 15 women and children, alongside insurgents, investigators found. U.N. officials called for an immediate halt to the use of air strikes in populated areas and urged Afghan air crews to use "greater restraint". While international forces declared their combat mission over at the end of 2014, they continue to conduct air strikes and special operations missions. Air strikes by international forces, comprised mostly of American warplanes, caused 38 deaths and 12 injuries among civilians, the U.N. reported.
UAE says ambassador to Afghanistan injured in Kandahar bomb attack | Reuters  [SEP]  DUBAI The United Arab Emirates' ambassador in Afghanistan has been injured in bomb attack at a guest house in the eastern city of Kandahar, the UAE foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday."(The ministry) is following the heinous terrorist attack on the guesthouse of the Kandahar governor which resulted in the injury of his excellency Juma Mohammed Abdullah al-Kaabi, UAE Ambassador to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and a number of Emirati diplomats," the statement said.

Maduro to seek re-election as Venezuela eyes presidential vote by...  [SEP]  Venezuela’s constitutional assembly has ordered presidential elections by April 30 as the ruling socialist party seeks to consolidate its grip on power amid a worsening economic crisis. President Nicolas Maduro said on Tuesday that he is ready to seek re-election after his allies pushed forward voting in a move widely seen as a bid to capitalise on disarray in the Venezuelan opposition. The election has been ordered to take place months ahead of when the country’s presidential voting has traditionally taken place. Mr Maduro said the ruling socialist party would settle on a single consensus candidate at a convention on February 4. If selected, he said, he would relish the opportunity to measure up against his opponents. He called on the National Electoral Council to set as near a date as possible for the presidential election. “They should find the closest date, to get this out of the way so we can begin to make a great revolution,” a jubilant Maduro told hundreds of redshirted supporters at a rally to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of Venezuela’s last military dictatorship. “If it was in my hands, the election would be this weekend,” he added. While Venezuelans had been expecting an early election, the announcement came as somewhat of a surprise because talks between the opposition and government have been taking place in the Dominican Republic for weeks — so far without a breakthrough. The opposition has been using those talks to push for guarantees that voting will be free and fair, with the participation of independent foreign monitors. Foreign ministers from 14 mostly conservative Latin American governments meeting in Chile to discuss Venezuela criticised the announcement of an early election, saying in a harshly worded statement that it was “impossible” for the ballot’s outcome to be credible under current conditions. Mexico, one of several foreign governments mediating the talks in the Dominican Republic, said it was withdrawing its support for the talks to protest the government’s move. When asked about Mr Maduro running for another six-year term, US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said: “I don’t think that’s a good idea.” Mr Maduro was accompanied at the rally by Diosdado Cabello, the number two leader of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela. It was Mr Cabello, seen as Mr Maduro’s biggest internal rival, who earlier on Tuesday proposed holding the election by the end of April, saying it was the best way to counter criticism by the US and others that Venezuela is descending into dictatorship. While he did not explicitly endorse Maduro, he praised him as the hand-picked successor of the late President Hugo Chavez and said the revolution would easily settle on a single candidate. “We’re not going to have any problem,” Cabello said to thunderous applause during Tuesday’s raucous session of the constitutional assembly. This would be Venezuela’s fourth election since a July vote installed the constitutional assembly, which has been condemned internationally as a naked power grab by Mr Maduro. According to Venezuela’s constitution, a new six-year presidential term must begin in January 2019. While an election can be held any time before then, voting is typically held in the final three months of the year to avoid an extended transition. Although polls say Venezuelans overwhelmingly blame Mr Maduro for widespread food shortages and triple-digit inflation that has pulverised wages, the opposition was left rudderless as several prominent politicians were barred from office or forced into exile last year following a deadly protest movement seeking the president’s removal.
In or out: Trump's gyrations on NAFTA cause flurry of head scratching  [SEP]  April 28, 2017 by Paul Wiseman And Josh Boak, The Associated Press WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump campaigned on an “America First” trade policy of bracing clarity: Renegotiate or abandon NAFTA and crack down on China’s trade practices. Yet so far, his trade policy has produced mostly confusion and division, even among fellow Republicans. At stake may be the president’s credibility over whether and how he will deliver on his campaign vow to undo decades of American trade policy and restore millions of manufacturing jobs lost to foreign competition. The latest puzzler broke out this week over the prospect that the Trump administration would simply abandon the North American Free Trade Agreement rather than start to renegotiate it. The White House leaked that possibility to reporters, rattling investors and drawing protests from business groups and Republican lawmakers. Yet hours later, Trump called it all off. He would actually seek to revamp the trade pact with Canada and Mexico, he said, and pull out of NAFTA only if he couldn’t secure a favourable deal. The U-turn followed a reversal on his trade stance on China. Trump this month broke a campaign promise to label China a “currency manipulator.” He had decided, he said, to instead reward Beijing for helping deal with a belligerent North Korea. Nor has he followed up on vows to punish American companies that move jobs overseas or on threats to tax Chinese and Mexican imports. “Unquestionably, he’s not delivered on his campaign promises,” says Lori Wallach, a critic of NAFTA and other trade deals and director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch. The president’s gyrations over NAFTA have been especially puzzling. On the campaign trail, Trump called the trade deal a job-killing “disaster” that had encouraged U.S. companies to move factories to Mexico to take advantage of cheap labour. If he couldn’t get Canada and Mexico to make concessions, he said, he’d pull America out of the deal. Then, in March, the administration sent a draft letter to Congress spelling out plans to renegotiate NAFTA. The plan kept much of the existing agreement intact. Many critics of NAFTA said they were deeply disappointed. So it came as a surprise Wednesday when word leaked that Trump was again taking a harsh stance: Aides said the president was considering a draft executive order to pull out of NAFTA within days. The Mexican peso fell against the U.S. dollar. American farm groups, which credit NAFTA with lifting U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico, howled. “Mr. President, America’s corn farmers helped elect you,” Wesley Spurlock, president of the National Corn Growers Association, said in a statement. Spurlock added: “NAFTA has been a huge win for American agriculture … losing access to these markets will be a huge blow.” Many businesses complain that pulling out of NAFTA would disrupt the cross-border supply chain companies have built since the agreement took effect 23 years ago. “The whole NAFTA structure is interwoven in our economy in a very close and important way,” said Josh Bolten, former chief of staff for President George W. Bush and now head of the Business Roundtable, a trade association for CEOs. “Many of America’s biggest, most successful businesses are highly dependent on North American supply chains and their goods may cross one or the other borders several times during the production process.” Republican lawmakers, who have typically supported free trade, weighed in, too. “Withdrawing from #NAFTA would be a disaster for #Arizona jobs & economy,” tweeted Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. “@POTUS shouldn’t abandon this vital trade agreement.” Then Trump announced that the leaders of Mexico and Canada had reached out to him Wednesday and that he would bow to their request to try to fix NAFTA through negotiations before abandoning it. “I decided, rather than terminating NAFTA, which would be a pretty big, you know, shock to the system, we will renegotiate,” Trump said. “Now, if I’m unable to make a fair deal, if I’m unable to make a fair deal for the United States, meaning a fair deal for our workers and our companies, I will terminate NAFTA. But we’re going to give renegotiation a good, strong shot.” Mexico’s top diplomat said the country learned only through media reports that the Trump administration was considering a draft executive order to withdraw from NAFTA. Foreign Secretary Luis Videgaray said Mexican officials reached out to their counterparts in Washington to discuss the reports. At the end of the day Wednesday, President Enrique Pena Nieto called Trump, and the two leaders spoke for about 20 minutes. Some trade policy analysts say the confusion reflects divisions within the administration between those who support Trump’s tough campaign rhetoric on trade and those who take a more traditional Republican view favouring trade agreements. “It likely reflects certain staff and structural problems in the White House, which are worsened by the ideological clash between competing factions,” says Eric Shimp, a former U.S. diplomat and adviser on trade at the law firm Alston & Bird. Alternatively, aides could have been trying to rack up a tough-sounding accomplishment before Trump’s 100th day on the job. Others see the threat to withdraw from the agreement as an attempt to jar Canada and Mexico into coming to the bargaining table ready to make concessions. Shimp notes, though, that they’d already said they were willing to negotiate changes to NAFTA. Clyde Prestowitz, a U.S. trade official in the Reagan administration who supports a tougher U.S. trade policy, says Trump’s modestly worded draft proposal for NAFTA in March probably suggests how negotiations will end: “In the end, there will be some minor changes to NAFTA and victory will be declared.” “Trump has talked tougher than other presidents, but so far his actions are completely consistent with what they did,” Prestowitz says. “Talking about it is much easier than actually doing it.” Then again, the administration has just slapped tariffs on Canadian softwood timber imports and launched investigations into whether steel and aluminum imports jeopardize U.S. national security. And Congress has yet to approve Trump’s nominee for U.S. trade representative: Robert Lighthizer, who has advocated using existing trade law more aggressively to combat unfair trading practices. “While the president clearly has failed to deliver on his 100-day promises, the longer story is unwritten,” Wallach says. “It could go either way.”
It's time to count the votes in Montana  [SEP]  Bozeman, Montana (CNN) Republican candidate Greg Gianforte was considered the favorite heading into Montana's special election Thursday night to replace Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, but that was before the Republican allegedly "body slammed" a reporter during his final campaign event in Bozeman Wednesday. In 24 hours, the race for Montana's lone congressional seat has turned upside down. Just as questions continue to arise over why Gianforte wasn't brought into the Sheriff's office for questioning and what will happen to the Republican now that he must appear in court by June 7, it's time to count the votes in Montana.
5 killed, multiple missing after boat accident in China  [SEP]  BEIJING (AP) - Chinese state broadcaster CCTV says five people have died and others are missing after two dragon boats capsized in southern China, causing 60 people to fall into the water. CCTV reported that the boats had been rehearsing for a race on Saturday in the Taohua River in the city of Guilin when the accident happened. It was not immediately clear what caused the boats to capsize. Five bodies and two survivors were pulled from the water. CCTV says rescuers have been searching for an unspecified number of others who remained missing. China has sought to step up safety surrounding nationwide dragon boat racing on the Duanwu festival, which falls near the summer solstice and commemorates the death of the poet and minister Qu Yuan in the third century B.C.
White Helmets are denied entry into US again, Hollywood dreams over --  [SEP]  "A valid travel document is required for travel to the United States," a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security told the Associated Press when asked for a comment on the findings. According to internal Trump administration correspondence seen by The Associated Press, the Department of Homeland Security decided to block Khateeb." ~ Fox News "A Syrian cinematographer up for an Academy Award Sunday night has been reportedly barred from entering the U.S. over the finding of "derogatory information" - a vague term that can mean anything from a simple passport irregularity to terror connections. Khaled Khateeb , 21, who worked on the Netflix documentary "White Helmets," was scheduled to arrive in California on Saturday.This was the revelation that we woke up to, this morning...The previous time this happened was in April 2016 when White Helmets leader, Raed Saleh, was denied entry into the US to receive an award from InterActionfor his contributions to "humanitarian relief". Mark Toner of the US State Department, tried hard to field difficult questions from Matt Lee of AP but failed dismally, finally admitting that it was Saleh's possible "extremist connections" that had resulted in his deportation from the US.WATCH ~ AP also reported on Khateeb's US entry denial:Raed Saleh tweeted yesterday, that he was basically "too busy" to go to Hollywood and mingle with the stars of the silver screen, to further promote his Al Qaeda affiliated organization, already multi-million-funded by the moguls of war in the NATO and Gulf State alliance.Has the attempt to give an Oscar to supporters of terrorism for their propaganda movie, endorsing a No Fly Zone that is effectively a declaration of war between Russia and the US on Syrian soil, just failed?Has Trump's administration called a halt to the farce that is the promotion of this fraudulent non-Non-Governmental-Organization, funded, in fact, by governments with Israel's best interests at heart in Syria? Remember that during Obama's administration, Homeland Security was overruled when Secretary of State, John Kerry, allowed Raed Saleh entry into the US in September 2016 (despite Saleh's 'extremist connections') and to the UN in New York for, behind-closed-door-talks ,on why the US had failed to impose a No Fly Zone in Syria.It appears that Khateeb has also been coached in the "I'm too busy helping people" excuse;The following video is a compilation of the testimony from Syrian civilians released from a five year incarceration in East Aleppo, under a terrorist regime & occupation led by Al Qaeda factions aka Nusra Front and assorted extremist militant brigades, also funded by the US, NATO and Gulf states. These testimonies attest to the US and UK construct, the White Helmets, being nothing more than "Nusra Front's civil defense".The Syrian Arab Red Crescent also told 21WIRE editor, Vanessa Beeley, that they had never seen the White Helmets conducting humanitarian work in East Aleppo, either during or after occupation by the extremist groups.WATCH ~The SARC reinforcing the claim made by Syrian civilians that the NATO and Gulf state-funded White Helmets did not conduct any civilian rescues or offer paramedic treatment in East Aleppo.WATCH ~Perhaps this Oscar bid for the White Helmets is an indication of the level to which the ruling elite have stooped to maintain their facade, which has been eroded so successfully by the few brave people who have taken a stand against their global machinations, such as Tulsi Gabbard and Carla Ortiz, both of whom potentially risk their careers to present the truth of what is actually happening inside Syria.Has the steadfast bravery, courage and resistance of the Syrian people, the majority of whom are fully supportive of the Syrian state and the Syrian Arab Army, finally demolished the wall of lies that has prevented their voices being heard?The White Helmets propaganda film may still be awarded the Oscar, but it will be a hollow prize when the recipients have been denied entry into the country of origin or are simply, "too busy" to attend. It will be embarrassing for the producers to explain the absence of these self proclaimed, "saviours of humanity". The truth is revealing itself bit by bit and when the White Helmets fall, much of the NATO and Gulf State war effort in Syria will be damaged beyond repair.
Russian Federation surveillance aircraft flies over Washington secure airspace – Normangee Star  [SEP]  The Russian Air Force plane passed over the US Capitol, Pentagon, Joint Base Andrews, CIA, Camp David, and a secret government bunker called Mount Weather, CNN said. A Russian military spy jet soared over President Trump’s current hometown of Washington, D.C. and New Jersey Wednesday afternoon, according to reports. According to the treaty guidelines, US airmen are aboard the Russian jet observing when an Open Skies flight occurs. Meanwhile, a US State Department official confirmed to TASS that the path of the observation flight had been completely agreed by Washington and Moscow. The fly-over is allowed under a 2002 treaty that allows Russian Federation, the United States and more than 30 other countries to fly short-notice, unarmed flights in each other’s territories. The flights are meant to foster transparency about military activity, reduce mistrust or misunderstandings and help monitor arms control and other agreements. “The aircraft will be large and may fly directly over the U.S. Capitol”, the statement said. The Capitol Police issued an alert prior to the flight noting that an “authorized low-altitude aircraft” would be passing over without announcing its origins. The U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency would not confirm the Russian flights, but said a typical mission conducted per the treaty has multiple flights taking place over several days. The Treaty on Open Skies was signed in 1992 and came into force in 2002. Senior U.S. intelligence and military officials have expressed concern that Russian Federation is taking advantage of technological advances to violate the spirit of the treaty. “We put together the flight plan and with a few exceptions – safety-wise or weather-wise – they are allowed to fly over pretty much the entire territory”. The main purposes of the open skies regime are to develop transparency, render assistance in monitoring compliance with the existing or future arms control agreements, broaden possibilities for preventing crises and managing crisis situations within the scope of the Organizations for Security and Cooperation in Europe and other relevant global organizations.
Passenger-carrying drone set to debut in Dubai  [SEP]  DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - Up, up and away: Dubai hopes to have a passenger-carrying drone regularly buzzing through the skyline of this futuristic city-state in July. The arrival of the Chinese-made EHang 184 — which already has had its flying debut over Dubai's iconic, sail-shaped Burj al-Arab skyscraper hotel — comes as the Emirati city also has partnered with other cutting-edge technology companies, including Hyperloop One. The question is whether the egg-shaped, four-legged craft will really take off as a transportation alternative in this car-clogged city already home to the world's longest driverless metro line. Mattar al-Tayer, the head of Dubai's Roads & Transportation Agency, announced plans to have the craft regularly flying at the World Government Summit. Before his remarks on Monday, most treated the four-legged, eight-propeller craft as just another curiosity at an event that views itself as a desert Davos. "This is not only a model," al-Tayer said. "We have actually experimented with this vehicle flying in Dubai's skies." The craft can carry a passenger weighing up to 100 kilograms (220 pounds) and a small suitcase. After buckling into its race-car-style seat, the craft's sole passenger selects a destination on a touch-screen pad in front of the seat and the drone flies there automatically. The drone, which has a battery allowing for a half-hour flight time and a range of up to 50 kilometers (31 miles), will be monitored remotely by a control room on the ground. It has a top speed of 160 kph (100 mph), but authorities say it will be operated typically at 100 kph (62 mph). Al-Tayer said the drone would begin regular operations in July. He did not elaborate. The Road and Transportation Agency later issued a statement saying the drone had been examined by the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority and was controlled through 4G mobile internet. The agency did not immediately respond to further questions from The Associated Press. The United Arab Emirates already requires drone hobbyists to register their aircraft. However, drone intrusions at Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest for international travel, has seen it shut down for hours at a time in recent months. EHang did not respond to a request for comment. In May, authorities in Nevada announced they would partner with EHang to test the 184 to possibly be cleared by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. The drone may be a techno curiosity for now but Dubai — the commercial capital of the oil-rich UAE and home to the long-haul carrier Emirates — has bold visions for the future and the 184 fits right into its plans. Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, announced in April he wanted 25 percent of all passenger trips in the city to be done by driverless vehicles in 2030. To that end, Dubai already has had the box-shaped driverless EZ10, built by France's EasyMile, cruise nearby the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building. In October, Dubai signed a deal with Los Angeles-based Hyperloop One to study the potential for building a hyperloop line between it and Abu Dhabi, the Emirati capital. A hyperloop has levitating pods powered by electricity and magnetism that hurtle through low-friction pipes at a top speed of 1,220 kph (760 mph). Elon Musk, the co-founder of Tesla who appeared on Monday at the Dubai conference, first proposed the idea of a hyperloop in 2013. Musk, who took no questions from reporters on Monday, later launched his Tesla car brand in Dubai at an event organizers said was not open to international media. Musk has come under criticism for serving on a business council advising U.S. President Donald Trump.
Asian markets mixed after Wall St falls on Turkey jitters  [SEP]  (AP Photo/Richard Drew). FILE - In this Oct. 24, 2017, file photo people pass the New York Stock Exchange. The U.S. stock market opens at 9:30 a.m. EDT on Monday, Aug 13. BEIJING (AP) - Most Asian stock markets were mixed Tuesday after Wall Street declined as Turkey's central bank struggled to contain a currency crisis that is feeding fears about other emerging markets. KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.5 percent to 2,771.81 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.9 percent to 27,686.99. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 1.8 percent to 22,255.98 and Seoul's Kospi added 0.4 percent to 2,257.65 Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 advanced 0.8 percent to 6,298.30. Benchmarks in Taiwan and New Zealand improved while Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand declined. WALL STREET: A stronger dollar hurt exporters, whose goods will get more expensive abroad. Most retailers were down, but Amazon advanced 0.5 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 0.4 percent to 2,821.93. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 0.5 percent, to 25,187.70. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.2 percent to 7,819.71. TURKISH TURMOIL: Turkey's central bank announced measures to help its banks, but the country's lira and stock market slid further. The lira has tumbled as investors question whether President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government can cope with problems including the weakening currency and a diplomatic spat with Washington that has resulted in higher U.S. tariffs. Erdogan has ruled out an interest rate hike, which can slow economic growth, but analysts say higher rates are urgently needed to stabilize the country's currency. CONTAGION FEARS: Emerging markets are falling out of favor due to problems in Turkey and Argentina. Investors worry Turkey's turmoil could affect the global banking system and economy. The Argentine peso sank to an all-time low amid investor caution and a corruption scandal involving former government officials. Also, rising U.S. interest rates are drawing money out of emerging markets in search of higher returns. ANALYST'S TAKE: Asian markets were "relatively more resilient " to Turkey jitters than South Africa and Latin America were, said Philip Wee and Radikha Rao of DBS Group in a report. But they said the U.S. tariff hike on Turkish steel at a time of "considerable stress" is a message to emerging markets not to expect Washington's help to "calm their markets" in difficult periods. "Expect more stress if the Fed continues to look past the emerging market turmoil (like it did in May) and keeps to gradual rate hike path," they said. CHINA COOLING: Growth in factory output, consumer spending and retail sales were weaker than expected in July, adding to signs of an economic slowdown. Factory output rose 6 percent over a year earlier, in line with the previous month but below forecasts. Retail sales gained 8.8 percent, down from June's 9 percent. Investment in factories and other fixed assets grew 5.5 percent in the first seven months of the year, down from 5.7 percent in the year to June. Forecasters have expected economic growth to decline since regulators tightened lending controls last year to rein in surging debt. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude gained 32 cents to $67.52 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract closed at $67.20 on Monday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 32 cents to $72.93 per barrel in London. It closed the previous session at $72.61. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 110.79 yen from Monday's 110.73 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1410 from $1.1411. Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

On both sides of Gaza border, residents prepare for worst  [SEP]  Israeli strikes kept Palestinians in Gaza on edge throughout the night over whether another devastating war was beginning, while tens of thousands of Israelis took refuge in shelters as rockets rained down. Israeli air strikes continued sporadically in Gaza on Tuesday while bulldozers cleared rubble left behind by the previous night's bombings that flattened multi-storey buildings. "What happened was like an earthquake," said Abu Ayman Lemzeni, who lives near Hamas's Al-Aqsa TV building in Gaza City destroyed by an Israeli strike. "As you see, here there is no more the grocery, the pharmacy, the office, the wall, the building." Before him, two satellite dishes could be seen in the rubble after the pulverising Israeli strike. Flashes of fire followed by powerful explosions came one after the other at a steady pace beginning at dusk on Monday. "The children are afraid. They are terrorised," said Gaza resident Jamal Murtaja. "We couldn't sleep last night or this morning." Many had only a short time to flee their homes and found themselves in the street due to a lack of secure shelters. "As soon as we saw the missiles, we ran outside the house," said Mohammed Aboud, who lives near the former Al-Amal hotel building, which Hamas had used as an internal security headquarters before it was hit on Monday night. "We are civilians. We don't have guns or rockets." Just 20 kilometres (12 miles) away, on the other side of Israel's heavily guarded security fence, the more than 128,000 residents of the coastal Israeli city of Ashkelon spent the night under rocket fire. "The girls are traumatised. It's not possible," said father of three Meir Edery. He points to the building in front of his, its top floor ripped open by a rocket that killed a Palestinian labourer and badly wounded an Israeli woman. Edery and his family took refuge in a shelter. A police spokesman said Israelis in Ashkelon have little more than 30 seconds to reach a secure location once an alert sounds. "We are demanding that the government give us the ability to raise our children securely," Edery said. "It's our most basic right." Behind him, neighbours called out "destroy Hamas," the Islamist movement that runs the Gaza Strip and with whom Israel has fought three wars since 2008. Along the city's port, nearly all stores had their shutters closed. Under the azure blue sky, Nissim Arzoane, 65, came to cast his fishing line in the sea, as he does each day. "We have to show them that we are not afraid," he said. Sitting at one of the rare open cafes, David Cohen called on the military to respond "without fear". "They will not break us," said the man in his 50s. Israeli authorities ordered the closure of schools and kindergartens, and many streets were deserted. Betty Calvo, 63, could not sleep at all the previous night. She tells her nine-year-old grandson Nahman, who lives near the Gaza border, to run to the shelter as soon as he hears the sirens. He says that he saw "rockets flying in the sky". "Is that normal that a child of that age tells that kind of thing to his grandmother?" she asks. In Gaza, a number of buildings destroyed in the last war with Israel in 2014 still have not been rebuilt. The streets of Gaza City, usually bustling and noisy, were deserted on Tuesday morning. The previous night, long lines formed at bakeries and stores as residents sought to stock up on goods in case of a new full-blown conflict. "We haven't forgotten the last war in 2014," said Mohamed Bulbul, who lives in the southern sector of the city. "People are tired of wars. That's enough."
London's Gatwick airport says runway open again after brief closure | Malay Mail  [SEP]  LONDON, Aug 31 — The main runway at London's Gatwick Airport was briefly closed today but has reopened, a spokesman for the airport said. Earlier, LBC radio said there were no arrivals or departures from the airport reportedly due to a problem with a Virgin Atlantic plane on the runway. — Reuters
President Claims another 1.5 Million Acres through Antiquities Act  [SEP]  The Obama administration on Tuesday declared two new monument designations – 1.35 million acres at Bears Ears in Utah and 350,000 acres at Gold Butte in Nevada. Both designations were made unilaterally and despite overwhelming local opposition. Public Lands Council President and Utah rancher Dave Eliason criticized the outgoing administration for both their disregard for local input and the manner in which these latest designations were executed. “Designating a monument in this manner – under the cloak of darkness and without even the decency of notifying the local communities, the states, or the congressional delegations of Utah or Nevada – speaks volumes about the disregard this administration has for local input,” said Eliason. “If the administration was proud of this action, they would have touted it proudly yesterday when the designation was made. Instead, the administration hid out while no one impacted by this monument was given the courtesy of a simple phone call until a full day after the papers were signed.” The designations of the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah and the Gold Butte National Monument in Nevada make it the 29th time President Obama has used his executive power under the Antiquities Act, more than any other president before him.
Toys 'R' Us lenders plan to revive brand  [SEP]  The top lenders of Toys 'R' Us have decided to cancel the bankruptcy auction of its brand name and other intellectual property assets and instead plan to revive the Toys 'R' Us and Babies 'R' Us brand names, a court filing on Monday showed. The bankrupt retailer's debtors aim to open a new Toys 'R' Us and Babies 'R' Us branding company that maintains existing global license agreements and can invest and develop new retail shops. The lenders also plan to expand its international presence and further develop its private brands business. The bids were not superior to the plan to revive the brand as it did not offer "probable economic recovery" to creditors as well as benefits to stakeholders who would maintain the brands under the new independent U.S. business, the court filing showed. Toys "R" Us filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in September last year, hoping to restructure some $5 billion in debt, much of which stemmed from a $6.6 billion leveraged buyout by private equity firms in 2005. But the company changed course in March, saying it would sell its operations in Canada, Asia and Europe, and shut down in the United States. Under the intellectual property auction, the company had planned to sell its assets, including the brand names of Toys 'R' Us, Babies 'R' Us, registry lists, website domains, Geoffrey the Giraffe and other assets.
Bracing for US sanctions, Iran lifts ban on exchange offices  [SEP]  With the Trump administration set to re-impose some sanctions on Iran on Monday, the country's Central Bank lifted a ban on exchange offices, allowing them to resume work in a move aimed at bringing in badly needed hard currencies. The bank also gave the green light for Iranian "legal institutions and businesses" to bring gold and foreign currency into Iran, according to the governor, Abdolnasser Hemmati. A first set of U.S. sanctions that had been eased by the Obama administration under the terms of the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal will take effect again on Monday, following President Donald Trump's decision in May to withdraw from the accord. Those sanctions target Iran's automotive sector as well as gold and other key metals. Renewed sanctions targeting Iran's oil industry and banking sector will resume on Nov. 4. Hemmati told sate TV late on Sunday that "money exchangers are allowed to sell and buy foreign currencies" once again, to help Iranians get better access to "services and travel abroad." The official exchange rate of the national currency, the rial, will remain at 42,000 rials to the dollar for vital imports such as medicine and food, he added. The decision goes into effect on Tuesday. Hemmati said the Central Bank will try "not to intervene in deciding on the price" of foreign currencies. Foreign currencies had recently doubled in price on the black market. The ban on the exchange offices, introduced in March, had left the offices idle overnight: gone were the familiar, daily long lines of Iranians waiting to buy or sell dollars. The measure also backfired, and the black market flourished. Hemmati said the government's decision in April to enforce a single exchange rate to the dollar had caused "serious problems" for the country. He maintained the Central Bank's decision reflects Iran's "strength" in the face of renewed U.S. sanctions. "We are facing an economic war and the U.S. government is restoring sanctions and also trying to increase them," he said. "But our government is powerful ... and is capable of opening up the foreign currency market on the same day." Hemmati said Iran has exported some $15 billion worth of non-oil products from April to July. The United States has also been pushing its allies to halt their import of Iranian oil ahead of the November deadline. Among the top importers of Iranian oil are China, India, Turkey and South Korea. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, meanwhile, has suggested Iran might block the Strait of Hormuz in response to a shutdown of its oil exports. The strait at the mouth of the Persian Gulf is crucial to global energy supplies as about a third of all oil traded at sea passes through it.
The U.S. is speaking with “one voice” on North Korea, the State Department said  [SEP]  WASHINGTON — The United States is speaking with “one voice” on North Korea, the State Department said Wednesday, after President Donald Trump's promises one day earlier of "fire and fury" in response to Pyongyang's nuclear provocations. “The United States is on the same page, whether it’s the White House, the State Department, the Department of Defense, we are speaking with one voice,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said Wednesday. One day earlier, during a short press availability with reporters at his Bedminster Golf Club, Trump promised further North Korean threats against the United States “will be met with fire, fury and frankly power the likes of which this world has never seen before.” Trump's remarks — which the White House says were the president's “own” words — came after reports that U.S. officials believe North Korea has developed a miniature nuclear weapon capable of fitting onto a missile. However, a U.S. official briefed on the assessment says the advancement does not mean North Korea has a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can survive reentry accurately. "Sound dialogue is not possible with such a bereft of reason and only absolute force can work on him," state news agency KCNA said in a statement posted online Thursday (Pyongyang time), which it attributed to a commander of North Korea's army. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, en route to Guam Wednesday morning said the president "was sending a strong message to North Korea in language that Kim Jong Un would understand because he doesn’t seem to understand diplomatic language." North Korea's state run news agency said that nation's government is "seriously reviewing" a plan to strike Guam, a U.S. Pacific territory. Tillerson also said Americans "should sleep well at night" when asked by reporters if people should be worried about the looming nuclear threat from North Korea — striking a starkly different tone from Trump's earlier comments. Experts and lawmakers, including Senator John McCain, R-Ariz., Senator Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. and Sen. Jack Reed, D-RI, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized the president’s comments as intensifying an already uneasy situation. “The President’s ‘fire and fury’ ad lib was not helpful," Reed said in a statement. "Defusing the North Korea threat will take smart, steady leadership and stronger diplomatic ties with our key allies." Nauert said that the president spoke with his Secretary of State after Trump’s “fire and fury” statements, but was unclear about whether the two men spoke before Trump made those comments. The two men have "ongoing conversations," she added. Defense Secretary James Mattis also put out a statement Wednesday urging North Korea to "stop isolating itself and stand down in pursuit of nuclear weapons." "The DPRK should cease any consideration of actions that would lead to the end of its regime and the destruction of its people," Mattis said in the statement. Mattis also stressed that while the State Department is seeking a diplomatic resolution, the U.S. and its allies are prepared to defeat any armed threat. "The DPRK regime's actions will continue to be grossly overmatched by ours and would lose any arms race or conflict it initiates."
Portugal 2 - Mexico 2: Euro 2016 winners stunned by late equaliser in Confederations Cup  [SEP]  A dramatic injury-time equaliser by Hector Moreno earned Mexico a point against Portugal in a controversial match at the Confederations Cup.All eyes were on Cristiano Ronaldo after the Real Madrid superstar reportedly told the club he was ready to quit after being accused of tax evasion.At the start of the match a minute’s silence was held in memory of those who had lost their lives in forest fires in Portugal.Once the match got underway, Mexico dominated possession without really troubling Portugal keeper Rui Patricio.The game's first controversial moment came in the 20th minute when a free-kick by Ronaldo hit the wall and when the rebound came back to him, his left-footed volley beat Guillermo Ochoa in the Mexico goal but struck the crossbar.The ball was then lifted back into the box and eventually found defender Pepe, who's strike crept in at the far post.But referee Nestor Pitana reviewed Portugal's goal and the video assistant referee (VAR) ruled it out for offside.Ochoa was then forced to make a smart stop to prevent Carlos Salcedo scoring an own goal.However, Portugal finally went in front in the 33rd minute when Ronaldo broke down the left and then squared the ball to Ricardo Quaresma, who rounded Ochoa and slotted the ball into an empty net.But Mexico hit back just before half-time when Portugal left-back Raphael Guerreiro failed to clear at the back post and Carlos Vela's ball into the box was met by a diving header from Javier Hernandez.Portugal was sharper in the final half an hour and got a goal from Cedric in the 86th minute:Cedric's goal looked to have been the breakthrough Portugal needed, but Mexico did not cave in. Going forward and with numbers, Mexico won a corner and made the reigning Euro champions pay with a lovely header off the post and into the back of the net by Roma newboy Moreno.With that, the result now gives both of the teams one point, a fair result. Russia leads Group A with three, while New Zealand has zero.This was a match either could have won, but Mexico will be more pleased with the result than Portugal will be. Still lots of work left for either to do, with two winnable matches left in the group stage for each.
With a dash of Putin and an echo of Mao, China’s Xi sets himself up to rule for life  [SEP]  BEIJING — Almost exactly five years ago, a newly anointed President Xi Jinping met his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, and declared they shared similar “personalities.” The comments, reported by the Kremlin news service but not by Chinese state media, went largely unnoticed at the time. But on Sunday, the parallels between the two leaders were too stark to ignore. China’s Communist Party is to abolish a two-term limit on the presidency, state media announced, potentially opening the door for Xi to rule for life. In that simple step, the Communist Party showed that it has forgotten one of the main lessons of the despotic rule of Mao Zedong, wrote Chinese legal expert and New York University professor Jerome Cohen in a blog post. The two-term limit was inserted into the constitution after the brutal and chaotic Cultural Revolution to prevent a return of one-man dictatorship. “Its abolition signals the likelihood of another long period of severe repression,” Cohen wrote. There was no fanfare surrounding the news here: indeed, it was buried within an article about much less portentous constitutional arrangements on page two of Monday’s print edition of party mouthpiece, the People’s Daily. Censors also got to work to prevent any popular debate. The freeweibo.com website, which monitors content censored from weibo, China’s version of Twitter, cited key phrases being deleted, including “serving another term in office,” “amendment to the constitution,” and “ascending the throne.” Some people reacted with humor, circulating a Disney weibo post from 2013 showing Winnie the Pooh gleefully hugging a huge pot of honey, with the caption “Find the thing you love and stick with it.” Winnie the Pooh is a common nickname for Xi: the bear’s name, along with Disney, were also among the leading censored terms Monday, freeweibo.com showed. Li Datong, a former editor who lost his job more than a decade ago in a row over censorship, issued a public letter Monday calling on delegates to next month’s annual meeting of the National People’s Congress to vote down the proposal. “China has to move forward not go backward,” he said. “China’s political civilization has finally reached such a level, how can you return to Mao era?” The news will have sent a chill through the Chinese legal and academic fraternity, already beset by the most severe crackdown on dissent and free speech in decades, experts say. But the implications are likely to be felt around the world, experts said. Xi has already fostered a sharp rise in Chinese nationalism, bolstered by a sense of grievance at historical “humiliations” by foreign powers and a burning desire to restore the nation’s central position on the world stage, experts say. He hasn’t followed Putin’s example by invading or annexing parts of a neighboring country, but nationalism is such a central part of his rule, it is hard not to expect anything but a steady ratcheting up of China’s demands for respect and recognition of its various territorial claims, experts say. “Xi is a big admirer of Putin,” said Willy Lam, a political expert at he Chinese University in Hong Kong, adding that this nationalist agenda fits well with the rising nationalism among China’s youth. “The most reliable legitimacy of Chinese Communist Party is nationalism.” he said. “Nationalism is very important to both the legitimacy of the party and Xi himself.” Putin, of course, didn’t change Russia’s constitution, but maneuvered around it by installing a loyal ally in Dmitry Medvedev to serve as president for one-term, while he retained the real power as the country’s prime minister – before returning for a third term as president in 2012. But Xi places considerable stress on the law as a justification for, and tool of, Communist Party rule. “No organization or individual has the power to overstep the constitution or the law,” he told a meeting of the party’s central leadership only on Saturday. In other words, if Xi stays, the constitution has to reflect that. Nor is Xi a man to rule behind the scenes, as Deng Xiaoping did in the 1980s, balancing competing interests but holding ultimate authority. Xi is a man who demands to be center stage, with a firm grip on all the levers of power, experts say. That power actually stems from Xi’s role as general secretary of the Communist Party, bolstered by his status as chairman of the Central Military Commission. There is no term limit on his role as general secretary. But his global stature also depends on his title as president – and Xi is not about to surrender that spotlight to a Medvedev-type subordinate, especially one who might one day grow too big for his boots, experts say. The way that the careers of internet czar Lu Wei, a man who courted the public eye in meetings with people like Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg, or Chongqing Party boss Sun Zhengcai, were abruptly ended by corruption charges were dramatic illustrations that Xi will brook no rivals, experts added. There is a potential upside to all of this. Xi has already used his power to implement a far-reaching crackdown on corruption, even if it has also been used to instill obedience and eliminate rivals. He is equally determined to improve the way the party governs China, eliminate poverty and even improve the country’s poisoned environment: all elements of what he calls the “Chinese dream.” But in this vision, there is no room for checks and balances, or for dissent or protest, experts say. There is only benevolent rule from on high. The risks are obvious. Joseph Stalin and Mao both illustrated the dangers of centralizing too much power in one man’s hands, because one lonely man at the top can easily become paranoid. That is not to suggest Xi is about to become Mao and implement a new Cultural Revolution, or stage mass executions like Stalin, although the human rights environment is worse than at any point since the aftermath of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, activists say. Autocratic rulers who don’t allow feedback from the grass roots also tend to make mistakes, “Academics, think tank experts, writers, and artists will not make public statements at odds with, or even moderately critical of, Xi-ist doctrine,” Robert Daly, director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States, wrote in a discussion on the ChinaFile website. “The silence of intellectuals and local officials will mean that the Communist Party cannot receive timely, accurate policy feedback from China’s many geographic subregions and social and economic constituencies.” Indeed, one of the cited strengths of Communist Party rule – the way regional officials used their discretion and local knowledge as a check on ill-considered central government policies – could be undermined, warned China policy expert Yanmei Xie at Gavekal Dragonomics in a client note. Increased pressure on officials to deliver on targets could lead to more falsification of data, Xie wrote, or more clumsy and unsettling attempts to demonstrate compliance at all costs. That’s a real risk in a country whose economic growth figures are already largely discredited, and where Mao was told grain production was booming during a famine that killed tens of millions of people. “So far, these risks have proved manageable, because the central government has been quick to adjust policy when implementation gets out of hand,” Xie wrote. “But these risks mirror the risks from Xi’s concentration of power at the top level: that the person making policy is increasingly insulated from criticism or feedback, leading to bad decisions and poor results.” China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang berated a reporter on Monday who raised concerns about the scrapping of the term limit, calling the decision “a matter for the Chinese people.” But the Trivium consultancy in Beijing headlined their client note Monday with a simple quote from Deng himself. “To build the fate of a country on the renown of one or two people is very unhealthy and very dangerous.” The Washington Post’s Shirley Feng and Amber Ziye Wang contributed to this report.
MH17: Buk missile system from Russia, says Dutch-led investigation – video  [SEP]  A member of the Dutch-led joint investigation team (JIT) presents the body’s findings after an inquiry into the downing of flight MH17 on 17 July 2014, killing all 298 people on board. Speaking on Wednesday from the Dutch city Nieuwegein, Wilbert Paulissen explained that by using witnesses and phone data it had been possible to conclusively trace the path of the Buk system from Russia into Ukraine. The Russian foreign ministry denies the claims
Kroger : to Stop Selling Guns to Buyers Under 21 -- 5th Update | 4-Traders  [SEP]  Kroger Co. said it would stop selling guns to buyers under 21 years old through its Fred Meyer locations, the third major retailer to tighten its policies while lawmakers continue to debate how to respond to the latest school shooting in America. The U.S.'s largest supermarket chain said Thursday it would raise the minimum age to purchase arms and ammunition in all of its Fred Meyer stores in response to the Parkland, Fla., high-school tragedy. Kroger currently sells firearms at 43 Fred Meyer locations in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington. Kroger stopped selling assault-style semiautomatic rifles in Oregon, Washington and Idaho at Fred Meyer stores several years ago and decided Wednesday to no longer sell those style of guns or special orders for them in Alaska, a spokeswoman said. Kroger's Fred Meyer chain, which the company acquired through a merger in 1999, sells general merchandise, including home items, electronics and sporting goods. Kroger sold roughly $7 million worth of firearms and ammunition out of $115 billion in total sales in its 2016 fiscal year, the company said. "Recent events demonstrate the need for additional action on the part of responsible gun retailers," said Jessica Adelman, a spokeswoman for the Cincinnati-based chain. "In response to the tragic events in Parkland and elsewhere, we've taken a hard look at our policies and procedures for firearm sales." Meijer Inc., also said Thursday it would raise the minimum age to purchase ammunition in stores to 21 years old. The 235-location, general-merchandise chain based in Grand Rapids, Mich., doesn't sell firearms, said a spokesman for the company. Bi-Mart, a regional sporting goods chain with 77 stores, said Thursday it also would raise the minimum age to purchase a firearm or ammunition to 21. The Eugene, Ore., company sells rifles and shotguns, but doesn't sell assault-style weapons or high-capacity magazines. "We agree with many policy makers and our peers that increasing the age limit to 21, in order to purchase a firearm, is a step in the right direction," the company said. "We will continue to carry our current selection of items for the hunter and sport shooter." The retailers' moves follow announcements by two of the largest U.S. firearms retailers. Walmart Inc. and Dick's Sporting Goods Inc. on Wednesday raised the purchase age for guns to 21. Dick's also said it would stop selling high-capacity magazines at all its stores and halt sales of assault-style rifles at its 35 Field and Stream stores. Walmart halted sales of assault-style rifles in 2015. It is unclear how many gun buyers are under 21, because the federal government doesn't track sales and the Federal Bureau of Investigation doesn't disclose the age of applicants for background checks. The FBI conducted 25.2 million background checks for firearms last year, down from a record 27.5 million in 2016. Under current law, licensed gun dealers can sell a handgun to someone 21 years old and sell a rifle to someone who is 18. President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Rick Scott have expressed support for raising the age limit for rifle sales, but the National Rifle Association has rejected any such move. An NRA spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment. The alleged 19-year-old Parkland shooter left 17 people dead and has prompted a growing list of U.S. companies to re-evaluate their gun-selling policies and preferential treatment to NRA members. Many companies have taken a stand on gun control in response to a social-media movement spurring the action, but the moves can come with reputational risks. The Domini Impact Investments LLC mutual fund in 2016 asked Kroger to stop selling semiautomatic weapons in its stores. Kroger challenged the resolution, and federal regulators sided with the company because such investor requests generally can't govern what a company sells. In addition to the increased age limit, Kroger is reducing space devoted to firearms in its Fred Meyer stores in response to "softer demand and changing customer preferences," Ms. Adelman said. Fred Meyer stores currently sell shotguns, .22-caliber rifles, bolt-action hunting rifles and handguns. Doug Cameron and Sarah Nassauer contributed to this article.
Le Pen thrives among French poor, vote analysis shows  [SEP]  PARIS, April 25 (Reuters) - Marine Le Pen's protectionist, anti-establishment message resonated most in parts of France with lower incomes, lower life expectancy and lower education levels, a Reuters analysis of voting in Sunday's first round shows. However there was no evidence that she scored particularly highly among young voters this time, many of whom backed hard-left campaigner Jean-Luc Melenchon. Moreover, it was not clear that she fared better in rural communities than in towns as some analysts have suggested. Ahead of a May 7 runoff against centrist Emmanuel Macron, these are some conclusions that can be drawn by plotting Le Pen's scores in France's 'departments' - similar to counties - against government data on key social and economic factors. Surveying Le Pen's results against more than a dozen such measures, the data suggest her message played particularly well in low-income areas with higher numbers of school dropouts. In fact, for each 1,000-euro drop in the median income in a given area, Le Pen scored nearly two extra percentage points, according to a Reuters calculation using results and data from the Social Affairs Ministry. http://tmsnrt.rs/2pduHE9 Meanwhile, life expectancy for women tends to run nearly five years shorter than the average 85.2 in departments where Le Pen scored high and nearly three years lower than the average male expectancy of 79.1. http://tmsnrt.rs/2q1NmFS But among the variables surveyed, education levels are the most revealing. The percentage of under-35 voters to have left school without a diploma has a heavy 60 percent correlation to Le Pen's scores. http://tmsnrt.rs/2q1PVb0 In statistics, correlation is measured between zero and 100 percent - the higher the count the closer the link. One exception to that trend is Paris' northern working-class suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis, a traditional stronghold of the left, where over one-in-four 25-34 year-olds did not finish school. There, she won only 13.6 percent of the vote, coming in after Melenchon and Macron. Unemployment is also a major factor explaining where Le Pen did best with the jobless rate by department 58 percent correlated with her scores. http://tmsnrt.rs/2pdpoo9 Perhaps unsurprisingly given her anti-immigrant stance, departments with high levels of foreign-born populations tended to vote less for Le Pen, notably those areas concentrated around Paris and its suburbs. http://tmsnrt.rs/2p0iYdw And although Le Pen scored high in some rural departments, that was not systematically the case. Similarly, although she did poorly in some more urbanised departments, she also did well in some more densely populated areas. http://tmsnrt.rs/2pdsEzY Ahead of the vote, surveys suggested Le Pen was faring much better among voters under-25 than among the population at large, often by a margin as high as 7 percentage points. But in the end there was little evidence that age was a determining factor in her share of the vote. http://tmsnrt.rs/2q278Ry A study by pollsters Ipsos of the first round results may explain why that was the case: while it found that 21 percent of 18 to 24-year-old voters backed her - largely the same as for the population as a whole - a massive 30 percent opted for her hard-left rival Melenchon.
U.S. Border Patrol Agent Charged With Killing 4 Women and Attempting Murder on a Fifth  [SEP]  (HOUSTON) — Texas authorities charged a U.S. Border Patrol supervisor with murder following what they described as the serial killing of four female sex workers and a possible attempt on the life of a fifth woman who escaped at a gas station and found help. Juan David Ortiz, 35, an intel supervisor for the Border Patrol, was charged with four counts of murder and aggravated assault and unlawful restraint, Webb County District Attorney Isidro Alaniz said in a tweet. Ortiz was arrested after the fifth woman managed to flee. State troopers found Ortiz hiding in a truck in a hotel parking lot in Laredo at around 2 a.m. Saturday. The border city is about 145 miles (235 kilometers) southwest of San Antonio. “We do consider this to be a serial killer,” Alaniz said. Alaniz said that after the suspect picked up the fifth woman she quickly realized that she was in danger. “When she tried to escape from him at a gas station that’s when she ran into a (state) trooper,” Alaniz said. He said that authorities believe Ortiz had killed all four women since Sept. 3. The names of the victims were not immediately released. Alaniz said two of them were U.S. citizens but the nationalities of the other two were not yet known. All of them were working as prostitutes and one was a transgender woman, he said. “The manner in which they were killed is similar in all the cases from the evidence,” said Alaniz. He declined to discuss the evidence or say how the women were killed. Alaniz said investigators are still trying to determine a motive for the killings. Authorities said they believe Ortiz acted alone. “It’s interesting that he would be observing and watching as law enforcement was looking for the killer, that he would be reporting to work every day like normal,” Alaniz said. Ortiz was a 10-year veteran of the Border Patrol. U.S. Customs and Border Protection issued a statement saying that it was fully cooperating with the investigation. “Our sincerest condolences go out to the victims’ family and friends. While it is CBP policy to not comment on the details of an ongoing investigation, criminal action by our employees is not, and will not be tolerated,” the agency said. The Texas Department of Public Safety, whose Texas Rangers are investigating, did not return several messages seeking comment.
Helmut Kohl, chancellor who reunited Germany, dies at 87  [SEP]  BERLIN >> Helmut Kohl, the physically imposing German chancellor whose reunification of a nation divided by the Cold War put Germany at the heart of a united Europe, has died at 87. Kohl’s Christian Democratic Union Party posted on Twitter: “We are in sorrow. #RIP #HelmutKohl.” The German newspaper Bild reported that Kohl died Friday at his home in Ludwigshafen. Kohl’s 16-year tenure as chancellor stretched from 1982 to 1998. He combined a dogged pursuit of European unity with a keen instinct for history following the November 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall. Kohl spearheaded, less than a year later, the end of Germany’s division at the front line of the Cold War. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton once described Kohl as “the most important European statesman since World War II.”

Search for bodies, answers after California wildfire kills 42  [SEP]  PARADISE, Calif. (Reuters) - Search teams were set to sift through the charred wreckage of Paradise, California, on Tuesday in the search of human remains as authorities investigated the cause of state’s deadliest ever wildfire. The “Camp Fire” blaze, still raging in northern California, has killed at least 42 people and left 228 others listed as missing. Another two people died in the separate “Woolsey Fire,” which has destroyed 435 structures and displaced about 200,000 people in the mountains and foothills near Southern California’s Malibu coast, west of Los Angeles. Authorities are probing the cause of the fires. A spokeswoman for the California Public Utilities Commission told the Chico Enterprise-Record on Monday the regulator has launched investigations that may include an inspection of the fire sites once the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) allows. The Camp Fire - California’s most destructive on record - has consumed more than 7,100 homes and other buildings since igniting on Thursday in Butte County’s Sierra foothills, about 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco. One hundred fifty search-and-recovery personnel were due to arrive on Tuesday, bolstering 13 coroner-led recovery teams in the fire zone, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said. Honea has requested three portable morgue teams from the U.S. military, a “disaster mortuary” crew, cadaver dog units to locate human remains and three groups of forensic anthropologists. Firefighting crews have carved containment lines around 30 percent of the Camp Fire perimeter, an area encompassing 117,000 scorched acres. Nearly 9,000 firefighters have been battling the wildfires. Cal Fire said that 16 other states, including Oregon, Texas, Missouri and Georgia, have sent fire crews or other resources to combat the fires. Most of the Camp Fire’s destruction and deaths occurred in and around Paradise, a town of nearly 27,000 people that was virtually destroyed overnight Thursday, just hours after the blaze erupted. Some 52,000 people remained under evacuation orders, Sheriff Honea said. Authorities said on Monday they found the bodies of 13 more victims, bringing the total killed by the Camp Fire to 42. This makes it California’s deadliest ever wildfire, surpassing the death toll of 29 in the 1933 Griffith Park blaze in Los Angeles. PG&E Corp, which operates in northern California, and Edison International, the owner of Southern California Edison Co, have reported to regulators that they experienced problems with transmission lines or substations in areas where fires were reported around the time they started. Speaking to KRCR TV early Tuesday, PG&E spokesman Blair Jones said prior to the outbreak of the Camp Fire, the site had not been “an area we were looking as a potential shut-off area.” More than 15,000 structures were threatened by the Camp Fire on Monday in an area where smoke had reduced visibility to under half a mile in some places. To the south, Woolsey Fire has blackened nearly 94,000 acres and was also 30 percent contained as of Monday night, according to Cal Fire. Winds of up to 40 miles per hour (60 km per hour) were expected to continue in Southern California through Tuesday, heightening the risk of fresh blazes ignited by scattered embers. Cal Fire said 57,000 structures were still in harm’s way from the Woolsey Fire. Some evacuees in Malibu, a seaside community whose residents include a number of Hollywood celebrities, were allowed to return home Monday but found themselves without power or cellphone service. California has recently endured two of the worst wildfire seasons in its history, a situation experts attribute in large part to prolonged drought across much of the western United States.
Cyclone Mekunu: Rainstorm expected in Goa, Maharashtra; landfall to be ‘extremely severe’ in Oman tonight  [SEP]  Considering the course that it has followed till now, the Cyclone Mekunu is expected to make landfall near Salalah Friday-Saturday midnight which is Oman’s third-largest city and inhabits about 200,000 people close to the kingdom’s border with Yemen. (Photo: Google Maps) Considering the course that it has followed till now, the Cyclone Mekunu is expected to make landfall near Salalah Friday-Saturday midnight which is Oman’s third-largest city and inhabits about 200,000 people close to the kingdom’s border with Yemen. (Photo: Google Maps) Cyclone Mekunu is expected to make an ‘extremely severe’ landfall in Oman, as the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued weather advisories to fishermen in India, advising them not to venture into the Arabian Sea till May 26. “Heavy to very heavy rainfall will most likely to occur one or two places in Kerala between May 27-29, while extremely heavy rainfall will occur at one or two places on May 28,” ANI quoted IMD as saying. “The weather around 1000 kms of Cyclone Mekunu is rough and wind is very strong, we had issued an advisory to fishermen to not venture in the sea. Some parts of Konkan Goa and southern Maharashtra may get rain and wind, other parts will not be affected,” informed an IMD scientist to news agency ANI. Although, no major destruction has been forecast for Indian coastal states, authorities have advised locals as well as fishermen to be cautious. An IMD advisory stated: “Gale winds speed reaching 160-170 Kmph gusting to 180 Kmph is very likely to prevail over Westcentral Arabian Sea during next 12 hours and wind gradually decrease becoming 80-90 Kmph gusting to 100 Kmph in subsequent 06 hours over Westcentral Arabian Sea.” Considering the course it has followed till now, the Cyclone Mekunu is expected to make landfall near Salalah Friday-Saturday midnight which is Oman’s third-largest city and inhabits about 200,000 people close to the kingdom’s border with Yemen.

Islamic scholar Tariq Ramadan to face French judge over rape claims  [SEP]  Prominent Islamic scholar Tariq Ramadan will face a French investigating magistrate Friday after two days of questioning over claims by two women that he raped them in French hotel rooms in 2009 and 2012. The judge may then formally charge the 55-year-old Oxford professor over the allegations which emerged in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, a judicial source told AFP. Ramadan, a Swiss citizen whose grandfather founded Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood movement, was taken into custody Wednesday as part of a preliminary enquiry in Paris into the rape and assault allegations. A regular face on French television, he is the most prominent figure to be held in France over the sexual assault and harassment claims that have rippled around the world as a result of the "Me Too" campaign. Ramadan has denied the separate accusations from the two women. The first was made by Henda Ayari, a feminist activist who previously practised a conservative strain of Islam. She had described being raped in a book published in 2016, without naming her attacker. But in October, she said she had decided to name Ramadan publicly as the alleged perpetrator as a result of the "Me Too" campaign, using the French hashtag "Balance Ton Porc" (Expose your pig). She said Ramadan raped her in his hotel room, telling Le Parisien newspaper: "He choked me so hard that I thought I was going to die." She lodged a rape complaint against Ramadan on October 20. Several days later an unidentified disabled woman, a Muslim convert, also accused the academic of violently raping her in a hotel room in the southeastern city of Lyon in 2009. Vanity Fair magazine, which met the woman, said her lawsuit against Ramadan described "blows to the face and body, forced sodomy, rape with an object and various humiliations, including being dragged by the hair to the bathtub and urinated on." During three hours of testimony in Paris on Thursday, the woman -- using the pseudonym "Christelle" -- recounted her allegations to the judge in Ramadan's presence. Rejecting her testimony, the scholar refused to sign the official summary of the account, sources close to the case said. "Both sides maintained their positions," one source said. During three months of investigations since the allegations emerged, police have interviewed dozens of people close to both Ramadan and the two women, and examined email and social media exchanges between them. In November, Oxford University said Ramadan was taking a leave of absence from his post as professor of contemporary Islamic studies, "by mutual agreement". He has also denied allegations in Swiss media of sexual misconduct against teenage girls in the 1980s and 1990s, denouncing them as "a campaign of lies launched by my adversaries". Lawyers for Ramadan, a married father of four, have accused Ayari of slander and suggested the women colluded to try to disgrace him. As part of his defence he has presented investigators with Facebook conversations in which a woman identified as Ayari allegedly made explicit advances towards him in 2014, two years after the alleged rape. The accusations have sparked heated online debate between supporters of Ramadan, who commands a following of more than two million fans on Facebook, and his opponents. Ayari was placed under police protection in November after receiving death threats. Ramadan continues to head the Islamic Institute for Ethical Training in France.
Over 100,000 visas revoked, government lawyer says in Virginia court | GantNews.com  [SEP]  More than 100,000 visas have been revoked since President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration and travel was signed January 27, government lawyers revealed Friday In a court session in Virginia. The number came in response to a question from the judge about how many people have been affected by this order. Erez Reuveni, from the Office of Immigration Litigation at the Civil Division of the Justice Department, also said no returning legal permanent residents have been denied entry. The judge also extended a temporary restraining order against removing lawful permanent residents until next Friday.
In shift, Trump warns Israel against new settlements  [SEP]  WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Thursday warned Israel that constructing new settlements “may not be helpful” to Middle East peace efforts, striking a tougher line with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. Trump has been perceived as sympathetic to the settlements, which are considered illegal by most of the international community. Shortly before taking office, he vigorously criticized the Obama administration for not vetoing a United Nations Security Council measure condemning settlements. But in a statement Thursday, the White House said, “While we don’t believe the existence of settlements is an impediment to peace, the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal.” The White House said the administration “has not taken an official position on settlement activity” and the president would discuss the issue with Netanyahu when he travels to Washington later this month. The two leaders are scheduled to meet at the White House on Feb. 15. The U.S. statement came hours after Netanyahu vowed to establish the first new West Bank settlement in over two decades “as soon as possible,” promising to make up for the court-ordered demolition of an illegal settler outpost. It was his latest step to expand Israeli settlement construction in the wake of Trump’s inauguration. Netanyahu repeatedly clashed with President Barack Obama during the Democrat’s eight years in office, and Trump has vowed to be a better partner for Israel. Following the U.N. vote, Trump tweeted, “Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching!” — referring to the date of his inauguration. Trump has already appeared to slow his promises to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem – a promise often made by presidential candidates, but never carried out in office because of fears the move would inflame tensions in the region. Newly sworn-in Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke by phone Thursday with Netanyahu. The prime minister’s vow to establish new West Bank settlements came as Israeli security forces were completing the evacuation of Amona, where they broke into a synagogue to remove dozens of Israeli protesters who had barricaded themselves inside. Netanyahu’s pro-settler government had unsuccessfully tried to block the evacuation of Amona, but Israel’s Supreme Court rejected all appeals after determining the outpost was built illegally two decades ago on private Palestinian land. Speaking at a ceremony in the West Bank settlement of Ariel, Netanyahu expressed “great pain” over the removal of Amona. According to the Israeli anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now, Israel has not officially broken ground on a new settlement since 1992. Since that time, however, it has greatly expanded its existing settlements and allowed dozens of unauthorized outposts to sprout up, in some cases subsequently legalizing them. In all, some 400,000 Israelis now live in West Bank settlements, in addition to 200,000 others living in east Jerusalem. The Palestinians claim both areas, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as parts of a future independent state. The international community has opposed the settlements, built on occupied lands sought by the Palestinians, as obstacles to peace. Britain and Germany, close Israeli allies, as well as the European Union criticized Netanyahu’s approval this week of 3,000 new settlement homes in the West Bank. “This spike in settlement activity undermines trust and makes a two-state solution – with an Israel that is safe from terrorism and a Palestinian state that is viable and sovereign – much harder to achieve,” said Britain’s minister for the Middle East, Tobias Ellwood. Amona has emerged as a symbol of settler defiance. On Thursday, Israeli police completed the evacuation of the wind-swept community, where hundreds of Jewish activists joined residents in resisting the pullout. Police began the evacuation Wednesday, but dozens of activists remained holed up in the synagogue. Police initially said 200 had barricaded themselves inside but later revised the number to about 100. On Thursday, several hundred Israeli forces surrounded the building, and officers wearing goggles and wielding plastic shields broke through the doors and sprayed water to push back defiant protesters. “The officers faced especially tough and violent resistance,” police said in a statement. Protesters sprayed fire extinguishers at police and threw rocks, paint bottles and wooden planks, police said. Slogans including “Death to Zionists” and a swastika comparing the Israeli police to Nazis were scrawled on the synagogue walls. The police later began dragging young protesters out of the building. Speaking to Israel Radio from inside the synagogue, the rabbi of Amona said the protesters were peacefully resisting the uprooting of the outpost. He spoke above loud noises and shouting in the background. Earlier Thursday, police removed protesters holed up in a small home nearby. Police said 24 officers were lightly injured throughout the evacuation, and 13 young protesters were arrested. Amona is the largest of about 100 unauthorized outposts erected in the West Bank without formal permission but with tacit Israeli government support. It witnessed violent clashes 11 years ago when police demolished nine homes found to have been built on private Palestinian land. The Supreme Court last year determined that the entire outpost was built illegally and ordered it demolished.
Donald Trump and the bully pulpit  [SEP]  Yesterday made a public statement , via Twitter, and told a bald-faced lie that millions of people voted illegally, denying him a win in the popular vote (there has been no serious effort by Trump to provide evidence for the claim; he made it up).You can see the reaction fromabove, who thinks it's "just amazing how [Trump] can control new cycle and drive libs crazy" via his tweets.In fact, it's not amazing at all. Trump, thanks to his coming victory in the electoral college, is the president elect of the United States of America. All substantive public statements by POTUS (or in this case, PEOTUS) are newsworthy. There is simply no disputing that. That is the power of the bully pulpit, a power that a leader can use responsibly, or not.There has been some hand-wringing about the media coverage of Trump's tweets. But it's worth noting that what makes Trump unusual is not the medium, but the content of what he says. A conspiratorial lie about the integrity of American elections (even after he won!) would be equally newsworthy, and repugnant, in the form of a press release, a speech, a post on his website, a televised address, etc. What makes Trump different than other American politicians is not some magical power to control the news cycle. It's a willingness to say outrageous, incendiary garbage that no responsible public official with any self control or moral compass, regardless of political persuasion or party, would dream of uttering (worth noting that when Trump starts these dopey fires, other GOP lawmakers never even try to defend theof what he says). Or —more likely — it's a childish inability to filter his tantrums. Perhaps that's not the best quality for the leader of the free world.Public statements from public officials matter; engaged citizens will hear them and the media of course should cover them. If the president says something that no responsible public official would say, yeah, of course it's going to pop up in the news cycle! Yay?Imagine that President Obama publicly stated, without evidence, that the election was fraudulent and that Clinton had been robbed of millions of votes. That sure would dominate the news cycle and drive folks crazy! But that wouldn't be amazing. It would be terrifying.For a closer-to-home analogy, it would be easy for Hendren's uncle,, to dominate the news cycle in Arkansas with a tweet any old time he wants. If Hutchinson tweeted a complete fabrication that hundreds of thousands of illegal votes were cast in Arkansas this year, I promise, the state's media would be all over it, there would be a big controversy, and lots of people would be mad. Thankfully, Hutchinson would never, ever, ever do that because Hutchinson — whatever disagreements one might have with him on policy — is a responsible and competent leader. He's a grown-up who takes his job seriously. Hutchinsonmake Trumpian statements and people would have no choice but to pay attention, but hedo that because it would be stupid, reckless, and bad for Arkansas.As for driving liberals crazy, it's trivially easy to make your political opponents mad online. One would hope that the president-elect has higher aspirations for the job we've entrusted him with. (Some conservatives seem to believe that if a liberal somewhere thinks something is bad, that something must be good. This seems like a wobbly moral frame, but we'll leave that for another time.)Trump won the highest office in the land fair and square (even if he apparently says otherwise), and we now have a president elect with an itchy Twitter finger, who is prone to saying stuff that POTUS should not say. That carries risks and consequences that go well beyond the tedious back-and-forth on cable news. Being president is different than being a reality-television personality. "Controlling the news cycle" is different than serving the American people. The public statements that Trump makes, like it or not, will create headlines and can have major real-world impacts at home and around the world. Hopefully voices like Hendren's will be among those ready to object if Trump abuses that awesome power.
Chinese President Xi Jinping visits Hong Kong to mark 20 years of Hong Kong's handover to China  [SEP]  Hong Kong, June 29: China President Xi Jinping arrived in Hong Kong who is on a three-day visit Thursday to mark 20 years since it was handed back to China by Britain. Jinping's trip has already riled democracy activists in the politically divided city. This is Jinping's first visit since becoming a leader in 2013 and comes at a time when there are growing fears that Beijing is threatening semi-autonomous Hong Kong's freedoms. Leading pro-democracy campaigners including Joshua Wong were arrested yesterday night after staging a protest outside the convention centre that will host some of the anniversary events, a stone's throw away from the hotel where Xi will be staying. The surrounding area has been cordoned off by giant water-filled barricades and police have said they are taking "counter terrorism security measures" to ensure Xi's safety. Protesters are likely to be restricted to zones well away from the official celebrations. Animosity towards Beijing has grown in recent years, particularly among young people. The failure of mass rallies in 2014 to win democratic reform has sparked a new wave of "localist" activists, keen to emphasise Hong Kong's own identity, with some calling for a full split from the mainland. Since the return to China in 1997, the city has been governed under a "one country, two systems" deal that gives it rights unseen on the mainland, including freedom of speech and an independent judiciary. But there are now concerns Beijing is trampling the agreement by interfering in a range of areas, from politics to education and media. Chinese authorities and local officials insist Hong Kong's semi-autonomous status is intact, but have railed against calls for self-determination or independence. Xi's visit will culminate in the inauguration of new city leader Carrie Lam. She has promised to heal divisions but has already alarmed critics by saying children should be instilled with Chinese identity from a young age and suggesting that independence activists could face punishment under the law. Lam was appointed by a pro-China committee although her main opponent, former finance secretary John Tsang, consistently topped opinion polls. A Beijing-backed framework for what would have been the city's first public leadership election sparked the protests of 2014 after it said candidates must be vetted. Since then, the debate on promised democratic reforms has stalled with Lam saying she is unsure the time is right to revisit it. She has said she wants to focus on livelihood issues instead, in a city where the wealth gap is at a record high and many cannot afford decent housing, fuelling tensions. Xi's trip will also include a visit to China's People's Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong, which defends the city. Xi is due to fly out of Hong Kong on Saturday, after Lam's inauguration. After the brutal crushing of democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989, there were fears ahead of the handover that the army would be heavyhanded. But in the past 20 years, the Hong Kong garrison has kept a very low profile.

Pennsylvania Courthouse Gunman Shoots 4, Killed at Scene  [SEP]  MASONTOWN, Pa. (CN) — A man arrested on domestic-violence charges shot three civilians and a police officer Wednesday outside a courtroom where he was due to appear. He was killed at the scene. Fayette County prosecutors say Patrick Dowdell, 61, entered the lobby of a courthouse in Masontown shortly after 2 p.m., drew a handgun and opened fire. Sgt. R. Scott Miller, the first to confront the gunman, sustained a shot to his hand. The gunman continued firing shots after Miller took cover, injuring two men and one woman with non-life threatening wounds. “I want to make it clear: Without the rapid response of these brave officers to the shooting, more individuals may have been shot,” Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Steve Dowlin said at a press conference. Miller and the three wounded civilians were taken to Ruby Memorial Hospital in Morgantown, West Virginia. They were all released Wednesday night. The two men are described as ages 35 and 47, and the woman is 39. About a month before the shooting, Dowdell had been arrested on charges of aggravated assault, terroristic threats, strangulation, simple assault and harassment. He was due in court on the day of the shooting in connection to those allegations.
Social media posts claim missing Kashmiri student from Uttar Pradesh university has joined militant ranks  [SEP]  Noida: Social media posts carrying purported pictures of a Kashmiri boy, who went missing from a private university in Uttar Pradesh days ago, on Friday claimed that he has joined militant ranks in the Valley. Ahtesham Bilal Sofi (17), a resident of downtown Srinagar, was a first year graduation student at Greater Noida's Sharda University. He went missing on 28 October after he left the varsity with official permission to go to Delhi, days after he was mistakenly roughed up during a scuffle between Indian and Afghan students in the campus. A missing complaint was registered in the case at the Knowledge Park police station in Greater Noida as well as at Khanyar police station in Srinagar, officials said. The pictures on social media showed Sofi dressed in a black outfit and claimed he had joined militant group ISJK, an outfit influenced by Islamic State ideology. The UP Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) said it has been tracking the case since 28 October and has taken cognisance of the photos. "We are in touch with Jammu and Kashmir police. We are tracking the footprints of the boy from Greater Noida to Kashmir," Inspector General, ATS, Asim Arun told PTI. The Jammu and Kashmir police said they were "ascertaining" Sofi's presence in the Valley. The Gautam Buddh Nagar police, who had traced the last location of Sofi's mobile phone to militancy-hit Pulwama district in south Kashmir, is also probing the matter. "A missing complaint was registered and police teams are working on the case," a senior official told PTI. According to the police here, Sofi had left for Srinagar from Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport in the afternoon of 28 October and reached Pulwama a few hours later. They said his mobile phone details showed that he last spoke to his father, who lives in Srinagar, at 4.30 pm, when his location was traced to Pulwama. However, he had told his father that he was is Delhi and was returning to the university by metro, the police said.
Some 400 prisoners escape prison in Tripoli chaos  [SEP]  TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Some 400 prisoners escaped from a jail in Libya’s capital on Sunday while fighting between rival armed groups raged nearby, a judiciary official said as the United Nations called for the warring parties to meet on Tuesday. The inmates forced open the doors of the Ain Zara prison and guards were unable to stop them, the official said, confirming a judiciary police statement posted on social media. He asked not to get identified and could not provide more details. The prison is located in southern Tripoli, an area hit for one week by heavy fighting between rival groups. Separately, a missile fell on Sunday on the al-Fallah camp for displaced Tawergha people, killing two and wounding seven, including two children, said Emad Ergeha, an activist following Tawergha issues. The Tawergha were forced to leave their settlement near the western city of Misrata in the NATO-backed uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and have been prevented from going back since. Ergeha, who is a Tawergha, also posted online a video of firefighters extinguishing a blaze and showing severe damage to steel-made containers in the camp. A rocket also hit the Waddan hotel in central Tripoli near the Italian Embassy on Saturday. Three people were injured, staff said. State oil firm NOC confirmed one of its diesel depots used to supply a power station had been hit by a rocket on Saturday. Fierce clashes erupted last week between the Seventh Brigade, or Kaniyat, from Tarhouna, a town 65 km (40 miles) southeast of Tripoli, against the Tripoli Revolutionaries’ Brigades (TRB) and the Nawasi, two of the capital’s largest armed groups. The U.N.-backed government based in Tripoli declared a state of emergency in the capital “given the seriousness of the current situation.” Although the government is formally in charge, it does not control the capital where armed groups are allied to it but operate with autonomy, often motivated by money and power. To end the fighting the U.N. mission in Libya called on the “various concerned parties” to meet on Tuesday noon for an “urgent dialogue on the security situation.”
Texas voter ID law was designed to discriminate, judge rules  [SEP]  A Texas law that requires voters to show ID before they can cast their ballots was designed to discriminate against minorities, a federal judge ruled Monday, marking the second time she has condemned the law’s intentions. U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos said the 2011 law has disproportionately impacted black and Latino voters — an outcome the Republican lawmakers who wrote it wanted, she wrote. “A discriminatory purpose was at least one of the substantial or motivating factors behind passage,” Ramos wrote in her 10-page ruling, adding that the voter ID law — which is largely considered to be the toughest in the nation after a court struck down a similar North Carolina rule in July — violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Enjoy this article? Sign up at Tribune.com for our upcoming newsletter. The Monday decision is the second time Ramos, appointed by former U.S. president Barack Obama, ruled against the law. She struck it down in 2014, writing that it “was imposed with an unconstitutional discriminatory purpose” and made it more difficult for Latino and black voters to cast their ballots. The state appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court, which in July agreed with Ramos’s ruling that the voter law was unconstitutional. But the appeals judges asked her to reconsider the part of her decision that insisted the bill was written with the specific purpose to discriminate against minority voters — paving the way for her Monday reaffirmation. After the appeals court upheld Ramos’s ruling, Texas appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, but in January, the high court declined to hear the case, allowing the decision against the law to stand. Ramos’ Monday ruling comes a month after a separate court ruled that Republican lawmakers in Texas gerrymandered several congressional districts in 2011, specifically and illegally drawing district borders based on the races of residents. The voter ID law was first proposed by Republican lawmakers in 2005, who argued it would prevent voter fraud by double-checking the identity of anyone who tried to cast a ballot. Under the legislation, each voter would need to provide one of seven types of ID — including driver’s licenses, passports, weapons permits, and special, state-provided voter ID cards — every time he or she went to the polls. But Democratic lawmakers insisted the legislation would hurt poor and minority voters, who are less likely to have ID — and who are more likely to vote for Democratic candidates. While Republicans held a majority in both the state House and Senate, Democrats were able to block the bill three times. But by 2011, the GOP had a two-thirds majority, and conservative lawmakers finally passed it. Then-governor Rick Perry signed the bill into law that May. It has remained in effect for the past six years, even as legal challenges mounted — although it was modified slightly ahead of the November presidential election. In August, the state and several groups advocating for minority voters struck a deal that softened the law by allowing anyone without an ID to vote so long as they signed an affidavit declaring that they were unable to obtain the required identification documents. Any voter who possessed proper ID was still required to show it. But the state’s ID law did not stop improper voting. In November, at least 500 people were able to vote in Texas without showing an ID by signing an affidavit — even though they indicated they had identification. Ramos’s ruling against the 2011 voter ID law could pave the way for the state to be stripped of its rights to change election laws without federal approval. Under the Voting Rights Act — which prohibits discrimination at the polling place and, among other things, outlawed literacy tests and other ploys that historically targeted minority voters — states with a history of racial discrimination must get permission from the Justice Department before they can change their voting laws. The 1965 law outlined a formula, which included states’ histories of discrimination devices, to determine which states needed so-called preclearance. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the part of the law that detailed that formula — but it kept the part of the law that describes pre-clearance intact. Essentially, it’s still legal for the Justice Department to require states to get federal approval before changing election laws, but there’s no set way to determine which states should be subjected to it. The Monday ruling states that Texas implemented discrimination election laws, but since the Voting Rights Act formula was overturned, there’s little precedent for what constitutes a history of racial discrimination. Deputies of Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton acknowledged that Texas could be subjected to preclearance following the ruling — but said even they are not certain. “It’s possible. It’s our belief that you’d have to have multiple instances of discriminatory purpose,” Brantley Starr, a deputy first assistant attorney general, said. Despite the uncertain future of preclearance in Texas, civil rights advocates lauded Ramos’s decision. “This is a good ruling that confirms what we have long known, that Texas’ voter ID law stands as one of the most discriminatory voting restrictions of its kind,” Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said.
Basque separatists ETA end Europe's last armed insurgency  [SEP]  Basque separatist group ETA formally declared its dissolution Thursday, marking the definitive end to western Europe's last armed insurgency after more than four decades of violence. Created in 1959 at the height of Francisco Franco's dictatorship, ETA was blamed for hundreds of killings and kidnappings in its fight for an independent Basque homeland in northern Spain and southwest France. The group said in a "final" statement it has "completely dismantled all its structures" and "has put an end to all its political activity". "ETA wishes to end a cycle of the conflict between the Basque Country and the Spanish and French states; the cycle of the use of political violence," it added in the statement, dated May 3 and presented in Switzerland and Spain. ETA was blamed for the deaths of 829 people during its armed campaign. The group's highest-profile killing was that of Franco's prime minister and heir apparent, Luis Carrero Blanco, in a Madrid car bombing in 1973. ETA also kidnapped dozens of business leaders to finance its activities, leading many people to leave the wealthy northern Basque region. Weakened in recent years by the arrest of its leaders, ETA announced a permanent ceasefire in 2011 and began formally surrendering its arms last year. ETA had already announced that it would be fully disbanding in a leaked letter addressed to various groups and figures involved in recent peace efforts and published Wednesday by Spanish online newspaper El Diario. International mediators will hold a peace conference in southwest France on Friday. Irish former Sinn Fein party leader Gerry Adams and representatives of several Spanish political parties are expected to attend. But Spain's conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy earlier on Thursday dismissed the planned announcement of ETA's disbanding as "noise and propaganda" and vowed there would be "no impunity" for the group's crimes. "ETA can announce its disappearance but its crimes do not disappear, nor do the efforts to pursue and punish them," he said in the northern city of Logrono. "We don't owe them anything and we have nothing to thank them for." While an overwhelming majority of Basques welcome the end of violence, many still want independence. The separatist coalition EH Bildu, the second largest grouping in the regional parliament, won 21 percent of the votes in the 2016 regional elections. The party has long called for the roughly 300 ETA prisoners held across Spain and France to be transferred to jails closer to the Basque region and their families. The regional leader of Spain's Basque Country, Inigo Urkullu of the nationalist PNV party, said he hoped Madrid would soon bring ETA prisoners closer to the Basque region. "It responds to a demand of the majority of Basque society," he said in an interview published earlier on Thursday in Spanish newspaper El Pais. "ETA never should have existed. It puts an end to a dark chapter of 60 years," he added. Apart from ETA victims, there were also separatists killed by far-right groups and death squads backed by members of Spain's security forces in what has become known as a "dirty war" campaign. According to a December report commissioned by the Basque regional government, more than 4,100 complaints of police torture were made between 1960 and 2014. Those victims are also demanding they be acknowledged. "If you don't recognise part of the suffering, it's very difficult to create conditions for... reconciliation," said Ane Muguruza, 28. Her father Josu, a lawmaker for Herri Batasuna, ETA's political wing, was murdered in 1989 by far-right militants she believes were state-backed. "It's very difficult when there are open wounds," she said. "To close them, you have to clean and cure them. And for that to happen, there must be acknowledgment, it's crucial."
Live: Senate holds vote-a-rama on Obamacare  [SEP]  The Senate is expected to begin a "vote-a-rama" Thursday on legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The "vote-a-rama" — which occurs after the Senate debates for 20 hours on proposed legislation — allows any senator to introduce an unlimited number of amendments that are voted on without debate. After the comprehensive replacement bill and the "clean" repeal bill were defeated this week, GOP leaders are now looking to pass a "skinny repeal" bill that would make limited changes to the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. You can watch the proceedings live in the player above.
When Trump's tweets rile Wall Street  [SEP]  President Donald Trump is famous for his itchy Twitter finger — his willingness to launch social media missiles without warning. And sometimes the targets are publicly traded companies. His recent tweets about Lockheed Martin and Boeing sent their stock prices reeling, at times wiping out billions in shareholder value. Trump praises companies too, applauding Wal-Mart and General Motors. All this means Wall Street is taking notice and making changes in a bid to stay on top of Trump-driven market swings. As is often the case with Trump, this behavior is not the norm. Presidents can impact markets generally. But a president willing to call out individual companies, repeatedly and without warning, is essentially unknown. "Certainly in my life, and I’ve been in the industry since 1980, I haven’t seen anything like it,” said Larry Tabb, CEO of TABB Group, which tracks technological change in financial markets. Trump’s Twitter daggers are maddening to professional investors who spend money and time carefully choosing stocks to own, only to see their investments suffer — at least in the short term — following Trump attacks. It’s a frustrating thing, but Wall Street doesn’t wallow in frustration long. Pain on the trading floor drives strategy change, new technology and in this case, even a phrase that’s starting to catch on: “tweet risk.” Traders monitored social media well before Trump’s election. One of the most high-profile examples of social media’s power to move markets was in 2013, when the Associated Press' Twitter account reported breaking news: explosions at the White House. The whole market sunk. And then it quickly recovered, once it was clear the AP had been hacked and the report was bogus. “I remember that day perfectly because it was pure chaos,” said Rachel Mayer, who was working on JPMorgan’s trading floor. She was part of a group that used algorithms to drive automated trading, long a tool professional investors have used to speed up reaction time. Now she’s CEO and co-founder of Trigger Finance, a tech startup that brings similar tools to regular investors through an app. Launched last summer, Trigger seems to be catching on. Mayer says there are 25,000 investors using Trigger, who have linked more than $210 million in assets to it. After Trump won, customers started asking for a feature to track his tweets about companies. The company built it and it is now the most popular feature on Trigger, though Mayer warns against making rash trades based on what Trump says. Setting up automated trading based only on social media is a bit dicey right now. Existing technology doesn’t do a perfect job of understanding human language, as opposed to cold numbers of an earnings report. “Our language is very complicated and the computers have a hard time figuring out exactly what language means,” said Charles Jones, a finance professor at Columbia Business School. And it’s even trickier in the abbreviated world of Twitter. “Most firms, even today, don’t have automated trading strategies based upon social media,” Tabb said. “Mostly what they’re doing is they’re waving big flags out to say, ‘Hey, look something is happening here. Let’s bring a human in to understand what the impact of this is.’” But of course, investors would love to speed that all up by cutting out the human. Wall Street, software engineers and artificial intelligence researchers are working on that right now. And Trump’s Twitter habit gives them a rich new set of experiments to run.
New Venezuela assembly fires dissenting attorney general  [SEP]  Venezuela's new Constituent Assembly sacks attorney general and vocal critic of President Nicolas Maduro, Luisa Luisa Ortega. A new assembly loyal to President Nicolas Maduro fired Venezuela's attorney general, a vociferous critic, in its first working session Saturday, bolstering criticism it is acting to support a "dictatorship." The body, the Constituent Assembly, made the sacking its first order of business since a widely condemned election a week ago. It also said the ousted chief prosecutor, Luisa Ortega, will face trial for "irregularities" while in office. "This is not a personal, political lynching, just carrying out the law," said one of the assembly's most prominent members, Diosdado Cabello. Earlier, dozens of soldiers had roughly barred Ortega, 59, from entering her offices, prompting her to say "this is a dictatorship." She said she did not recognize her firing and replacement with a staunch loyalist, current ombudsman Tarek William Saab, who was sworn in by the assembly. Ortega called the decision "outside the constitution and the law" and said: "I am not giving up, Venezuela is not giving up and will not give up against barbarity, illegality, hunger, darkness and death." Ortega was a thorn in Maduro's side for months, after breaking ranks with him over the legality of the Constituent Assembly. Her sacking had been widely expected. But its swiftness - and the fact it was a unanimous vote - showed the assembly was keen on taking aggressive, pro-government actions right out of the gate. The new body has been slammed internationally. Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil on Saturday declared Venezuela was indefinitely suspended from the South American trading bloc Mercosur for its "rupture of the democratic order." Maduro responded in an interview with an Argentine radio station that "Venezuela will not be taken out of Mercosur - never!" He accused his Argentine counterpart, Mauricio Macri, of trying to impose a "blockade" on Venezuela. He also railed against US President Donald Trump's "imperialist" administration, which slapped sanctions on him over the new assembly. America, he charged, wanted to get its hands on Venezuela's oil reserves, the largest in the world. But in Washington, Trump's national security advisor, H.R. McMaster, ruled out foreign military intervention, and said Washington did not want to give Maduro a pretext for blaming the US for his mounting woes. The country's economic and political crisis, he said, is "on Maduro's shoulders - he is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it." Venezuela, McMaster told US television network MSNBC, is under an "authoritarian dictatorship" that has staged a "coup" against democracy. The United States, the European Union and major Latin American nations including Mexico, Argentina and Chile have all rejected the Constituent Assembly. The body's legitimacy was struck a hard blow this week when a British-based firm that supplied the voting technology, Smartmatic, said the turnout figure was "tampered with" and greatly exaggerated. The principal task of the Constituent Assembly is to rewrite the constitution, something Maduro promised will resolve Venezuela's troubles. "We are going to win back peace," the president said. While working on its mission, the assembly holds supreme powers over all other branches of government. Initial suggestions were that it would need only six months to complete its work. But it announced on Saturday that it would stay in place for up to two years - beyond the end of Maduro's term, due to end in 2019. Its 545 members, all Maduro allies, include the president's wife and son. It is led by Maduro's fiercely loyal former foreign minister, Delcy Rodriguez. The opposition has vowed to maintain street protests against the assembly. Four months of demonstrations violently matched by security forces have left at least 125 people dead. But the rallies grew more muted this week as the assembly took its seats and vowed to go after those seen as inciting street action. Maduro has around 20 percent public support, according to surveys by the Datanalisis polling firm. Ordinary Venezuelans are struggling, with food, essentials and medicine scarce, the currency rapidly depreciating, and inflation soaring. Thousands have sought shelter in neighboring countries, particularly Colombia and Brazil.
Sichuan Airlines pilot was ‘sucked halfway’ out of window, captain says  [SEP]  SHANGHAI – The co-pilot of a Sichuan Airlines flight that was forced to make an emergency landing on Monday (May 14) was “sucked halfway” out of the plane after a cockpit windshield blew out, local media reported citing the aircraft’s captain. Captain Liu Chuanjian, hailed as a hero on social media after having to land the Airbus A319 manually, told the Chengdu Economic Daily his aircraft had just reached a cruising altitude of 32,000 feet when a deafening sound tore through the cockpit. The cockpit experienced a sudden loss of pressure and drop in temperature and when he looked over, the cockpit’s right windshield was gone. “There was no warning sign. Suddenly, the windshield just cracked and made a loud bang. The next thing I know, my co-pilot had been sucked halfway out of the window,” he was quoted as saying. “Everything in the cockpit was floating in the air. Most of the equipment malfunctioned … and I couldn’t hear the radio. The plane was shaking so hard I could not read the gauges,” he said. The co-pilot, who was wearing a seatbelt, was pulled back in. He suffered scratches and a sprained wrist, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said, adding that one other cabin crew member was also injured in the descent. None of the plane’s 119 passengers were injured. An investigation into how the incident occurred is underway. The flight, Sichuan Airlines 3U8633, left the central Chinese municipality of Chongqing on Monday morning and was bound for the Tibetan capital of Lhasa. It made its emergency landing in the southwest city of Chengdu. “The crew were serving us breakfast when the aircraft began to shake. We didn’t know what was going on and we panicked. Then the oxygen masks dropped… We experienced a few seconds of free fall before it stabilized again,” an unnamed passenger told the government-run China News Service. “I’m still nervous. I don’t dare to take an airplane anymore. But I’m also happy I had a narrow escape.” The windshield shattered about half an hour after the plane took off at 6.25 a.m. local time (1025 GMT), the Chengdu Economic Daily said. A separate report said the aircraft had accumulated 19,912 flight hours since entering service at Sichuan Airlines in July 2011. Incidents involving cracked windshields do happen on a regular basis due to occurrences such as bird or lightning strikes but ones involving entire windshields coming off are rare. In 1990, one of the pilots on British Airways Flight 5390 was blown partially out of the cabin window after its windshield blew out at 23,000 feet. He survived the incident, which occurred on a BAC-111 jet.
Dutch, Germans recover cargo lost by container ship  [SEP]  Cargo lost by a container ship in a North Sea storm has started washing up on a German island, while soldiers have arrived to help clean up beaches on Dutch islands further west. The MSC Zoe lost more than 270 containers earlier this week as it sailed from Portugal to the German port of Bremerhaven. German authorities say two of them contained dangerous substances: organic peroxide in one case and lithium-ion batteries in the other. Germany's Central Command for Maritime Emergencies said Friday that electronic screens and packaging have now washed up on the German island of Borkum, after large quantities of goods came ashore in the Netherlands. The Dutch military sent troops Friday to help clear beaches. German authorities said that recovering waterlogged containers is proving difficult.
Wasserman-Schultz IT Aide Arrested At Dulles Airport While Attempting To Flee Country » Alex Jones' : There's a war on for your mind!  [SEP]  Just a day after reports emerged that the FBI had seized a number of “smashed hard drives” and other computer equipment from the residence Imran Awan, the former IT aide of Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, we learn that Awan has been captured at the Dulles airport while attempted to flee the country. According to Fox News, Awan has been charged with bank fraud. For those who have managed to avoid this story, which wouldn’t be difficult given that the mainstream media has made every attempt to ignore it, the Pakistani-born brothers Abid, Imran, and Jamal Awan are at the center of a criminal investigation by U.S. Capital Hill Police and the FBI. Up until now, allegations of wrong doing have varied from simply overcharging taxpayers for congressional IT equipment to blackmailing members of Congress with secrets captured from the emails of their Democrat employers.
Powerful 7.1 earthquake shakes Mexico City  [SEP]  MEXICO CITY (AP) — A powerful earthquake jolted Mexico City on Tuesday, causing buildings to sway sickeningly on the anniversary of a 1985 quake that did major damage to the capital. The extent of damage or injuries was not immediately clear, but people fled office buildings along the central Reforma Avenue. The U.S. Geological Survey says it calculates the earthquake that struck central Mexico as magnitude 7.1. It says the epicenter was near the town of Raboso, about 76 miles (123 kilometers) southeast of Mexico City. Mexico’s seismological agency calculated its preliminary magnitude at 6.8 and said its center was east of the city in the state of Puebla. Pictures fell from walls and objects were shaken off of flat surfaces. Some people dove for cover under desks. Earlier in the day buildings across the city held preparation drills on the anniversary of the 1985 quake. This quake comes on the heels of Mexico’s massive 8.1 earthquake that claimed at least 90 lives. Stay with KRON4 for updates on this developing, breaking news story.

Sri Lanka declares state of emergency after Buddhist-Muslim clashes  [SEP]  COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena on Tuesday declared a nationwide state of emergency for seven days in a bid to curb communal violence after clashes erupted between majority Buddhists and members of the Muslim minority. Under the emergency, which was imposed for the first time since 2011, following the end of the civil war with Tamil separatists two years before that, security forces can carry out searches without warrant and detain suspects without charges. The move came after police said Sinhalese mobs targeted the properties of minority Muslims in eastern and central Sri Lanka, incensed by the death of a Sinhalese truck driver after a clash with Muslim youths in the central Kandy district on Sunday. Some people were instigating violence through Facebook , the government said, warning of tough action against them. “The president has instructed the police to impartially, comprehensively and promptly deal with those engaged in criminal activities and those causing or attempting to cause ethnic and religious tensions, irrespective of their ethnic or religious identities and political affiliations,” said a statement issued by Sirisena’s office. Tension has been growing between the two communities in Sri Lanka over the past year, with some hardline Buddhist groups accusing Muslims of forcing people to convert to Islam and vandalising Buddhist archaeological sites. Some Buddhist nationalists have also protested against the presence in Sri Lanka of Muslim Rohingya asylum-seekers from mostly Buddhist Myanmar, where Buddhist nationalism has also been on the rise. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told parliament that “political groups” he did not identify were trying to incite hatred against Muslims. Muslims make up about 9 percent of Sri Lanka’s 21 million people. Buddhists comprise about 70 percent and ethnic Tamils, most of whom are Hindus, about 13 percent. Analysts say the government has been alarmed by the speed with which the trouble spread in two districts of Kandy and sought to contain it through the imposition of emergency. Postings have appeared on Facebook threatening more attacks on Muslims. The unrest in Kandy began on Sunday after the funeral of the Sinhalese truck driver, the government said. It was not clear why the initial altercation occurred but after the driver’s funeral on Monday, a Sinhalese mob attacked Muslim shops, police said. Early on Tuesday the body of a Muslim youth was found in a burnt-out shop, police said. Area residents have said more than 30 shops and houses have damaged while scores of mosques also have been attacked after the government imposed a curfew on Monday. Police reimposed the curfew until 0600 hours (0030 GMT) Wednesday. The U.S. Embassy in Sri Lanka said it was important that the government act quickly against perpetrators of sectarian violence, and protect religious minorities and their places of worship. It also asked for an early lifting of the emergency.
WSJ: China may reject new trade talks if more tariffs imposed  [SEP]  WASHINGTON, Sept 16 (Reuters) - The Chinese government may decline to participate in proposed trade talks with the United States later this month if the Trump administration moves forward with additional tariffs on imported Chinese goods, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing Chinese officials. The U.S. had proposed the talks, but at the same time moved forward with planning additional tariffs on some $200 billion of Chinese products, the Journal reported. The report quoted one senior Chinese official saying the country would not negotiate "with a gun pointed to its head." Other officials who advise the country's leaders are suggesting China impose limits on the sale of parts and supplies needed by U.S. businesses, using "export restraints" to threaten their supply chains. Fresh trade talks had been proposed by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to begin around Sept. 20. Though China had begun discussing plans to attend, but began rethinking whether to attend because of the possibility new tariffs may be announced this week.
Barcelona's Sagrada Familia cathedral area closed off following false alarm reports of terror activity | WGMD  [SEP]  Police evacuated the Sagrada Familia cathedral Tuesday in Barcelona as part of an anti-terrorism operation, only to later claim that it was a false alarm. Police tweeted which streets and train stations were being closed as part of the operation. Mossos Police also said they “evicted” shops and businesses at the cathedral. ABC Catalonia reported that police received a warning prompting the evacuation of the cathedral. A bomb squad was also reportedly deployed to investigate a suspicious vehicle near the church, according to RT News. The operation came before the start of a soccer game between Barcelona and Juventus. In August, a van rammed into a crowd of pedestrians in Las Ramblas, Madrid, killing at least 13 people and injuring dozens of others. Another attack was later carried out in the Spanish resort town of Cambrils, where at least one person was killed. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks. Spain has remained on a high terror alert following the attacks.
Jammu and Kashmir: Four policemen killed at Sopore in First IED blast since 2015  [SEP]  SRINAGAR: In the first Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blast in the Valley since 2015, four policemen, including an Assistant Sub Inspector (ASI), were killed in Sopore town of north Kashmir’s Baramulla district on Saturday morning. The Jaish-e-Mohammad claimed responsibility for the attack that came less than a week of a fidayeen attack on a CRPF camp at Lethpora, Pulwama, in which five CRPF men were killed. A spokesman said the Afzal Guru squad of the outfit carried out the attack. A police officer said that the IED went off when a police party was patrolling the Chota Bazar area of main town Sopore this morning. “Four policemen including an Assistant Sub Inspector (ASI) were killed in the powerful blast,” he said. Three of the deceased were identified as ASI Irshad of Doda; Mohammad Amin of Kupwara and Ghulam Nabi of Sopore. Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) Munir Ahmad Khan said the militants planted a powerful IED near a shop in Chota Bazar of Sopore town and detonated it around 10 am when the men of IRP 3rd battalion of the J&K police were deployed in the area for law and order duty. The slain policemen are ASI Irshad Ahmad, constable Ghulam Nabi, constable Parvaiz Ahmad and constable Mohammad Amin. There are also some injuries in the blast, the impact of which was felt in the adjoining areas. At least three shops were also damaged in the blast. Sources said the IED was planted beneath a shop by the militants and detonated through remote control. Immediately after the blast, police, CRPF and army men launched combing and search operation in the area to nab the attackers. “I am pained to hear that four policemen were killed in IED blast in Sopore. My deepest condolences to their families,” Mehbooba tweeted. The police, CRPF and the army cordoned off the area and launched a combing operation but no arrests were reported. The ADGP said IEDs posed a new challenge to security forces. “It is the first IED blast in Kashmir since 2015. The use of IEDs had stopped in the Valley as it used to cause civilian causalities,” he said. Sources said the blast seemed to be the work of an expert in explosive devices. “It seems to be the handiwork of a Pakistani militant who might have been trained in handling explosives before his infiltration into the state.” Sopore town was shut today in remembrance of over 50 civilians killed in alleged security forces firing on this day in 1993. The call for the shutdown was given by the separatist leaders to remember the victims.
13 Killed in Helicopter Crash After Mexican Quake  [SEP]  MEXICO CITY (AP) — A military helicopter carrying officials assessing damage from a powerful earthquake crashed Friday in southern Mexico, killing 13 people and injuring 15, all of them on the ground. The Oaxaca state prosecutor’s office said in a statement that five women, four men and three children were killed at the crash site and another person died later at the hospital. A state government official who was not authorized to be quoted by name said the chopper crashed into a group of people who had been spending the night in an open field after a powerful 7.2 magnitude earthquake hit the area. Aftershocks had caused people to flee their homes for fear they would collapse. The Defense Department said the Blackhawk helicopter suffered the mishap when it was preparing to land on a vacant lot in the city of Jamiltepec, about 19 miles from the area of Pinotepa Nacional. The craft was carrying Interior Secretary Alfonso Navarrete and Oaxaca Gov. Alejandro Murat, neither of whom had serious injuries. The accident was the latest embarrassment in Navarrete’s short term at the Interior Department, which oversees most political and security issues. Earlier this month, an intelligence agent from an agency overseen by Navarrete’s department was caught tailing an opposition presidential candidate. Both Navarrete and the defense department said they regretted the loss of life in Friday’s accident. Jorge Morales, a local reporter who was aboard the helicopter when it crashed, described harrowing moments as the pilot lost control and the helicopter attempted to land in a swirl of dust. “The moment the helicopter touched down it lost control, it slid– like it skidded– and it hit some vehicles that were stationed in the area,” he told a Mexican television news program. “In that moment, you couldn’t see anything, nothing else was heard beside the sound that iron makes when it scrapes the earth.” Navarrete and Murat were evaluating reports of damage from the earthquake before their helicopter crashed. The U.S. Geological Survey originally put the magnitude of Friday’s quake at 7.5 but later lowered it to 7.2. It said the epicenter was 33 miles (53 kilometers) northeast of Pinotepa in southern Oaxaca state and had a depth of 15 miles (24 kilometers). President Enrique Pena Nieto said via Twitter that both officials and crew were fine, although the interior department said that they had light injuries.
Obama doesn’t criticize Trump, calls him pragmatic  [SEP]  WASHINGTON — President Barack Obama on Monday abandoned his dire warnings and dark predictions about his newly elected successor and urged Americans to give President-elect Donald Trump time to rise to the daunting responsibilities of the office, breaking sharply from his Democratic allies who have quickly condemned Trump’s first major decisions. In his first extended remarks on the election that pounded his party and his legacy, Obama sought to reassure an anxious world and nation about his successor’s commitments to alliances, at times appearing almost sanguine about a future Trump administration. Although he would not explicitly say Trump was qualified for the office, he said he believed the first-time officeholder would do his best to unite the nation, calling him pragmatic. He refused to wade into a political firestorm over Trump’s decision to name a far-right conservative media mogul as a top adviser. And he expressed hope that the weight of the presidency will force Trump to overcome his shortcomings. “He has won. He’s going to be the next president and regardless of what experience or assumptions he brought to the office, this office has a way of waking you up,” Obama said. “And some of his gifts that obviously allowed him to execute one of the biggest political upsets in history, those are ones that hopefully he will put to good use on behalf of all the American people.” Obama’s refusal to criticize his successor was a 180-degree reversal from the rhetoric of his campaign takedowns. Only a week ago, as he campaigned for Hillary Clinton, Obama said Trump was “woefully unprepared for the job” and couldn’t “handle the nuclear codes.” Obama’s latest remarks bore little resemblance to the calls for resistance coming from other Democrats and many of Obama’s supporters. As they come to grips with Trump’s surprising win, many Democrats have seized on a call not to accept or “normalize” the actions of a man who ran a divisive campaign that included charges of racism, sexism and other offensive rhetoric and actions. But Obama, who was the target of some of that rhetoric, has embraced the role of national hand-holder. Both in private and in a brief statement last week, Obama has suggested that Democrats should buck up and move on. He’s cast Trump’s election as in line with the usual zig and zag of politics. On Monday, as he prepared to embark on a three-nation trip abroad, Obama went so far as to vouch for Trump and his foreign policies. Although Trump campaigned as a harsh critic of NATO, Obama said Trump sounded a different note when they met in the Oval Office last week. Obama said the Republican “expressed a great interest in maintaining our core strategic relationships,” including “strong and robust NATO” partnerships. “There is enormous continuity … that makes us that indispensable nation when it comes to maintaining order around the world,” Obama said. Relationships and policies go beyond presidents, he said, adding that military officials, diplomats and intelligence officers would cooperate with their foreign counterparts as before. Obama acknowledged he had offered advice to Trump, saying he emphasized the need to shift from campaigning to governing, and the importance of resetting the tone after a contentious election. “I don’t think he is ideological,” Obama said. “And that can serve him well as long as he has got good people around him and he has a clear sense of direction.” Obama suggested he would continue to offer his advice. He said he would urge Trump “to think long and hard” before making good on his promise to upend Obama’s program that deferred deportation for hundreds of thousands of young immigrants who came to the country illegally as children. Asked about one of Trump’s most contentious moves since his triumph, appointing Steve Bannon as chief strategist and senior adviser, Obama said it was up to the president-elect to appoint a team. “It’s important for us to let him make his decisions,” Obama said of the choice of Bannon, a man celebrated as a force for the far right. But adding a hint of worry, Obama said he counseled Trump: “It’s really important to send some signals of unity.” Whereas Obama hailed Trump’s “impressive” ability to speak to voters, he also delivered a subtle critique of Clinton’s campaign. He said Democrats must broaden their focus beyond just swing states after an election that left the Senate and House in Republican hands, as well as most of the nation’s governor’s mansions. He rejected the idea that demographic advantages would lead to all-but-assured victories for the party, saying it must rebuild at the local, state and national levels. “We’re going to have to compete everywhere,” he said, reflecting on his own 2008 win in Iowa, a state that went for Trump this time. “We’re going to have to show up everywhere.” Clinton kept a relatively light campaign schedule until the final weeks of her campaign, mostly attending smaller events in battleground states. Her campaign focused heavily on motivating the Democratic base of female and minority voters, rather than swaying independents. “Good ideas don’t matter if people don’t hear them,” Obama said. While Obama is in Germany, Greece and Peru, he said his team would accelerate efforts to ensure a smooth transition to the Trump administration. He stressed that he would try to strengthen the American economy over his final two months, and all but acknowledged he would not take any dramatic action to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in his final weeks in office. “One of the things you discover about being president is that there are all these rules and norms and laws and you got to pay attention to them. And the people who work for you are also subject to those rules and norms, and that’s a piece of advice that I gave to the incoming president,” he said.
Irma devastates St Maarten  [SEP]  (MIRROR.CO.UK).–Hurricane Irma has slammed into the Caribbean island of St Maarten, leaving a trail of devastation as homes, hotels and government buildings have been reduced to rubble. Usually offering a paradise getaway for sun-seeking tourists, footage from the island shows flooded roads and broken structures. A witness caught up in the carnage filmed this shocking scene from a high-rise balcony. The clip shows cars almost completely submerged in the flood water and piles of wreckage strewn in the streets. Despite being first hit by the 185mph winds and category 5 hurricane, rain and powerful winds continue to batter the already shattered island. French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said government buildings, the sturdiest on the island, have also been wrecked by Irma’s incredible force. He said: “We know that the four most solid buildings on the island have been destroyed which means that more rustic structures have probably been completely or partially destroyed.” The island has been without electricity since 6am this morning and police have reported several roofs have been torn off buildings during the storm. Irma also slammed into the Caribbean island of St Bartélemy and the larger island of Guadeloupe. France has requisitioned planes and sent in emergency food and water rations. Footage from the island shows the force of the winds as Irma continues to destroy the island. Wreckage and trees can be seen ripping through streets as sheets of torrential rain also continue to fall. The regional authority for Guadeloupe and neighbouring islands said that the fire station in Saint Barthelemy is under 3ft of water and no rescue vehicles can move. It said the government headquarters in Saint Martin have been partially destroyed and the island is in a total blackout. Electricity is also partially down on the larger island of Guadeloupe, where the threat receded despite danger of heavy flooding. French minister for overseas territories Annick Girardin expressed fear “for a certain number of our compatriots who unfortunately didn’t want to listen to the protection measures and go to more secure sites”. She added: “We’re preparing for the worst.” The hurricane has become the most powerful ever recorded over the Atlantic Ocean and could potentially hit The British and US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas and potentially Florida by the end of the week. Caribbean island residents stocked up on provisions as the government urged them to take shelter and brace for the impact of Irma. A Brit who was trapped in a stairwell as Hurricane Irma smashed into the Caribbean has described the “apocalyptic” scenes that unfolded around him.

Over 100,000 visas revoked, government lawyer says in Virginia court  [SEP]  More than 100,000 visas have been revoked since President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration and travel was signed January 27, government lawyers revealed Friday in a court session in Virginia. The number came in response to a question from the judge about how many people have been affected by this order. Erez Reuveni, from the Office of Immigration Litigation at the Civil Division of the Justice Department, also said no returning legal permanent residents have been denied entry. The judge also extended a temporary restraining order against removing lawful permanent residents until next Friday.
East Coast Main Line to be brought back under public control  [SEP]  Rail services on the East Coast Main Line will be brought back under public control following the termination of the franchise agreement with Virgin Trains East Coast (VTEC), Stagecoach Group has said. The firm, which owns 90% of VTEC, said it was "surprised and disappointed" that the Government chose not to award it a new deal to continue running services on the London to Edinburgh route. Trains will be run by the Department for Transport (DfT) through an operator of last resort (OLR). Stagecoach pledged to "work constructively with the DfT and the OLR in the weeks ahead to ensure a professional transfer to the new arrangements". Transport Secretary Chris Grayling told the Commons in February that the franchise would only be able to continue in its current form for a "very small number of months" as Stagecoach had "got its numbers wrong" and "overbid". In November 2014, Virgin Trains East Coast - a joint venture between Stagecoach and Virgin - was awarded the franchise to run trains for eight years. Stagecoach reported losses on the line and in November last year Mr Grayling announced that the franchise would be terminated in 2020 to enable it to become a public-private railway. The decision to end the £3.3 billion contract this year has been described as a "bailout" by Labour and trade unions. Mr Grayling insisted in February that "there is no question of anyone receiving a bailout". He added: "Stagecoach will be held to all of its contractual obligations in full." VTEC is the third private operator to fail to complete the full length of a contract to run services on the East Coast route. GNER was stripped of the route in 2007 after its parent company suffered financial difficulties, while National Express withdrew in 2009. Services were run by the DfT for six years up to VTEC taking over in 2015.
Jonathan Demme remembered by A-listers from Bruce Springteen to Stephen King  [SEP]  News that Academy Award–winning director Jonathan Demme had died at 73 from complications of esophageal cancer was greeted Wednesday by social-media and other public tributes from such A-listers and luminaries as Ron Howard, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, Spike Lee, Bruce Springsteen and David Byrne, as well as Stephen King, Rosie O’Donnell, Anne Hathaway, Ira Glass and Mike Birbiglia. Demme, who helmed not only “Silence of the Lambs” and “Philadelphia” but lighter fare such as “Rachel Getting Married” and “Something Wild” along with documentaries including “Stop Making Sense” and “Mandela,” was called buddy, neighbor, inspiration and genius by his fellow entertainment notables:

Two Americans among four cyclists killed in hit-and-run in Tajikistan  [SEP]  Two Americans were among four foreign cyclists killed in a hit-and-run in Tajikistan. The U.S. citizens died Sunday along with a Swiss and a Dutch national, and three other tourists were injured in the incident, which occurred in Danghara district, 43 miles from Dushanbe, the capital of the central Asian nation. Their identities weren’t immediately released. Umarjonni Emmomali, a government spokesman, told CNN that investigators are considering "all possibilities," including terrorism and whether the hit-and-run was an accident. The Tajikistan Interior Ministry told CNN in a statement that officials found the vehicle that is thought to have struck the tourists in the village of Torbulok. One suspect was arrested and "during the resistance" two other suspects were "eliminated," the statement added. No further information was provided. Local media reports said the suspects attacked the tourists with knives after the car struck the group, who were touring the country with three others from France, the Netherlands and Switzerland, the BBC reported. “In working closely with Tajik authorities, we can confirm that two American cyclists were killed in the Danghara district on July 29,” the U.S. Embassy in Dushanbe said in a statement posted on Facebook. “Due to privacy concerns, we are unable to share further details. Our condolences go out to the victims' families, and we will continue to work with Tajik authorities in the ongoing investigation,” the statement added.
South Africa quits International Criminal Court  [SEP]  South Africa has withdrawn from the International Criminal Court (ICC), in the most damaging blow to the 14-year-old institution since the collapse of the war crimes case against Kenyan president Uhuru Kenyatta, which energised the court’s opponents two years ago. Announcing the decision, South Africa’s justice minister, Michael Masutha, maintained that the country’s obligations under the Rome Statute which set up the ICC, to arrest anyone wanted by the court, were fatally at odds with domestic laws giving sitting leaders diplomatic immunity. South Africa did not wish to execute arrest warrants which could lead to “regime change”, Mr Masutha declared. An “instrument of withdrawal” signed by international relations minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, and dated October 19th, has been sent to the United Nations in New York – and takes effect one year after receipt by UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon. The abandonment of the Kenyatta case for lack of evidence in 2014, before it even got under way, fuelled accusations among African countries that the ICC has been pursuing a pro-western “neo-colonial agenda” – focusing disproportionately on “hunting” black African leaders. That blow to the credibility of the court was followed in 2015 by South Africa’s embarrassing refusal to arrest Omar al-Bashir, the Sudanese president wanted by the ICC for genocide in Darfur, when he arrived for an African Union (AU) conference chaired by Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe. The refusal was described as “a betrayal of Nelson Mandela’s legacy” – a view reinforced when the supreme court of appeal upheld a high court ruling that Al-Bashir should indeed have been arrested, describing the ANC government’s conduct as “disgraceful”. The ICC subsequently criticised South Africa for its failure to comply and since then the row has been simmering, with this historic withdrawal – soon to be followed by that of Burundi, whose parliament voted last week to leave – well signalled by Pretoria and simply a matter of time. The South African decision has caused fury among the country’s opposition and international human rights groups, many of whom maintain withdrawal is not possible without parliamentary approval. James Selfe of the main opposition Democratic Alliance, said his party would file a court application to set aside the withdrawal “on the grounds that it is unconstitutional, irrational and procedurally flawed”. Human Rights Watch said the move showed “startling disregard for justice from a country long seen as a global leader in accountability for victims of the gravest crimes”, while Richard Goldstone of the Coalition for the ICC described it as “demeaning” for the parliament and people of South Africa. Whatever happens inside South Africa, the decision to withdraw will give new impetus to calls within the AU for a mass withdrawal from the ICC – possibly replacing it with the African Court for Human and People’s Rights, which allows sitting heads of state immunity from prosecution. Even if that does not happen immediately, one has to wonder how long it will be before the withdrawals of South Africa and Burundi are following by that of Kenya, America’s closest ally in the region – and the drip, drip of the ICC’s receding influence in Africa.
US tells Turkey it will end weapons support for Syrian Kurdish YPG - Anadolu  [SEP]  The United States has told Turkey it will not provide any more weapons to the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, Turkish state media said on Saturday, as Turkey's offensive by against the U.S.-backed YPG in Syria entered its eighth day. ANKARA: The United States has told Turkey it will not provide any more weapons to the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, Turkish state media said on Saturday, as Turkey's offensive by against the U.S.-backed YPG in Syria entered its eighth day. The Turkish incursion in northwest Syria's Afrin region against the YPG has opened a new front in the multi-sided Syrian civil war, but has also further strained ties with NATO ally Washington. Washington has angered Ankara by providing arms, training and air support to the Syrian Kurdish forces. Turkey sees the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a deadly insurgency in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast for three decades. Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency said on Saturday that Ibrahim Kalin, spokesman for President Tayyip Erdogan, and U.S. National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster held a phone call on Friday in which McMaster confirmed the United States would no longer provide weapons to the YPG.
Kluber, Indians top Porcello, Red Sox 5-4  [SEP]  BOSTON (AP) — Boston pitcher Rick Porcello had the wind knocked out of him after taking a hard liner to the stomach. Two pitches later, Cleveland’s Greg Allen knocked the energy right out of Fenway Park. Allen hit a go-ahead home run in the seventh inning right after Porcello was struck, Corey Kluber tied for the major league lead with his 16th win and the Indians beat the Red Sox 5-4 Monday night. “That was intense,” Allen said. “You really weren’t sure (if he was staying in) especially after a hit like that.” In a meeting of AL division leaders — and a matchup of the last two Cy Young Award winners, it was 3-all into the seventh. Porcello (15-6) retired the leadoff batter and walked the next hitter. Yan Gomes followed with a liner that hit Porcello near the stomach — Porcello retrieved the ball near the mound, threw to second for a forceout and then slid to his knees, grabbing the spot where he was hit. Porcello was checked on the mound, took a practice toss or two, and stayed in the game. Allen then sent a drive into the Indians’ bullpen for his second home run of the season. “I don’t think the one that hit him had any effect on the next pitch. The first changeup was a good one,” Boston manager Alex Cora said. “Then he threw another one and he hung it.” Porcello said after he caught his breath that he was fine. He was more bothered by what he threw after that. “The pitch to Allen — I’m not trying to take anything away from him — but I think even I could have hit that one pretty hard,” he said. “That was not a good pitch and it came at the worst possible time.” Kluber (16-6) pitched into the seventh inning and matched Washington’s Max Scherzer and the Yankees’ Luis Severino for the most victories in the majors. Michael Brantley and Melky Cabrera also homered to help the AL Central-leading Indians improve to 14-4 in August. Xander Bogaerts had an early two-run single and an RBI single in the ninth for East-leading Boston. The Red Sox had the first two runners on against closer Cody Allen in the ninth, and scored a run on Bogaerts’ dribbler with two outs before Ian Kinsler flied out with two runners on base, leaving them with just their fifth loss in 22 games. “That’s what’s called holding on for dear life,” Indians manager Terry Francona said. “You can breathe a sigh of relief after throwing 27 pitches and 20 of them were questionable and seven of them were good,” he said. Kluber, who won his second Cy Young Award last year, gave up three runs and nine hits, striking out six and walking one in 6 1/3 innings. Porcello allowed five runs on three homers, fanning six and walking one over seven. The game featured four top contenders for the AL MVP award: Boston outfielder Mookie Betts, who leads the majors in hitting (.342), and DH/outfielder J.D. Martinez, the majors’ home run (38) and RBIs leader (106), along with Cleveland third baseman Jose Ramirez (second in homers with 37) and shortstop Francisco Lindor. Trailing 3-0, Cabrera homered into Boston’s bullpen in the fifth and Brantley hit his drive into Cleveland’s bullpen the next inning. Bogaerts flicked a low-and-away pitch into right-center with two outs in the first for his single. Andrew Benintendi’s opposite-field RBI single made it 3-0 in the third. Francona, who managed the Red Sox from 2004-11, talked about one of his favorite players, Boston 2B Dustin Pedroia, who has missed most of the season recovering from offseason left knee surgery. “There’s nobody like him and I don’t imagine there will be,” Francona said. “He willed himself to be the player he is, and his body is paying for it.” The clubs combined for a half-dozen highlight defensive plays. The best two were: a long running grab by CF Allen off the bat of Kinsler and a diving catch by LF Benintendi, robbing Allen. Members of both pitching staffs were tossing footballs around in opposite sides of the outfield about 3 1/2 hours before the start, with Boston’s crew laughing and smiling as it ran fly patterns. Indians: DH Edwin Encarnacion (disabled list since Aug. 12, right wrist contusion) took batting practice on the field. Red Sox: Cora said lefty ace Chris Sale (went on DL Saturday, mild left shoulder inflammation) hasn’t thrown yet. “We’re shooting whenever he’s ready,” Cora said. “We’re not going to push him.” … C Christian Vazquez (DL, fractured right pinkie) has been catching bullpens and hitting soft toss. Cora hopes he’ll start taking BP later this week. He also was in CF catching pop ups from a machine before BP. … 3B Rafael Devers (DL, strained left hamstring) did some light running on the field. Indians: Rookie RHP Shane Bieber (6-2, 4.37 ERA) is scheduled to make his first career start against the Red Sox on Tuesday. Red Sox: RHP Nathan Eovaldi (5-4, 3.62) is set to start. He’s 2-0 with a 1.99 ERA in four starts with Boston since being acquired from Tampa Bay before the trade deadline. Copyright © 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Hurricane party breaks out as Matthew misses Fort Lauderdale  [SEP]  FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — With Hurricane Matthew out at sea and aimed well north of this city known for parties, a big one broke out Thursday across the street from waves churned up by the storm. A huge crowd spent the day tossing back beers and singing along with a guitar player at the Elbo Room, situated on a corner in the heart of an area that’s typically overrun by college students during spring break. A smaller crowd partied at another bar one block over. And just up the street, Kim Siegel pranced like a gazelle atop a squat beachside wall as a friend shot videos. “I’m happy to have a breeze. We haven’t had one months,” she said. Although Fort Lauderdale was initially in Matthew’s crosshairs, forecasters said the hurricane didn’t move inland as far south as first expected. So rather than hunkering down in her home just off the coast, Melody Fortunato took her German shepherd for an afternoon walk. She also spent a few hours watching TV and cleaning out files on her two computers. “I’m just doing things … you don’t normally do,” she said. Fort Lauderdale residents took all the necessary precautions for Matthew, stripping store shelves clean of bottled water and bread and moving luxury yachts while the storm was still days away. A luxury Bentley was nestled safely beside Toyotas and Jeeps in the vault-like parking garage of a resort hotel. But the worse never came. So Michael Levi and a buddy went swimming in the ocean, bobbing down the beach in foamy white spray kicked up by Matthew. “It’s not the brightest idea in the world, but it’s fun,” said Levi of Pembroke Pines, Florida. “A lot of people are afraid to look at this, and actually it’s quite beautiful. It’s quite amazing. It’s a one-in-a-lifetime type thing.” The mood wasn’t as bright a few miles inland at a huge shelter set up in two schools where officials said more than 800 people sought refuge as the storm bore down on the road. Brad Witt, who normally lives in a tent and works as a day laborer, feared staying outside during Matthew. “I came here to ride out the storm,” he said. Adam Bator went to the beach to ride the waves. Along with about a half-dozen others, Bator strapped a board to his feet and spent the morning in the ocean being pulled along by a kite that was puffed out by Matthew’s wind.
EU court orders Poland to halt logging in ancient forest  [SEP]  A European court has ordered Poland to immediately stop cutting trees in Europe's last pristine forest of Bialowierza. The press service for the European Union's Court of Justice said Friday the measure is temporary while European authorities analyze Poland's position on the matter. European authorities and environmental groups say the logging threatens the continent's last unspoiled woodland, which is included on the UNESCO list of World Heritage sites. Poland's environment minister has authorized increased logging, saying it is meant to save the woods from a spreading infestation of bark beetle. Poland has until Aug. 4 to explain that policy to the European Commission, which then will decide whether to seek a permanent ban on the logging.
Russian opposition leader Navalny briefly detained  [SEP]  MOSCOW (AP) — Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who has been barred from running in the next month's presidential election, said he was briefly detained by police on Thursday. Navalny said on his Twitter account that he was nabbed early Thursday afternoon as he was leaving a dentist's office in Moscow. Less than an hour later he tweeted that he was taken to a police station where he was presented with charges of organizing an unsanctioned rally and released. There was no official confirmation and it was not immediately clear when he would appear in court. Navalny, who is President Vladimir Putin's most formidable foe, spearheaded protest rallies last month, calling for a boycott of the upcoming presidential vote. He was briefly detained at a Jan. 28 protest in Moscow but police did not immediately bring any charges against him. Navalny's allies speculated that police would delay charging him to allow authorities to keep him behind bars on the election date, March 18. Navalny mounted a nationwide grass-roots presidential campaign last year, tapping into the discontent in Russia's once politically dormant provinces which have traditionally voted for Putin. The anti-corruption campaigner was denied a place on the ballot in December because of a fraud conviction that many view as politically motivated. Separately, Navalny's campaign chief Leonid Volkov said he was detained at a Moscow airport earlier on Thursday. His whereabouts were not immediately clear. Navalny's boycott campaign is worrisome for the Kremlin, which fears that a lower voter turnout would be seen as a sign of declining support for Putin. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

New German foreign minister criticises Russian response to chemical...  [SEP]  BERLIN, March 14 (Reuters) - Germany's new foreign minister, Heiko Maas, criticised Russia on Wednesday over its stance towards a nerve agent attack in England for which the British government has blamed Moscow and he said it could not go unpunished. In his first speech as foreign minister shortly after taking up the post in Germany's new coalition government, Maas also criticised Russia's behaviour in Ukraine but said he still hoped to improve relations with Moscow through dialogue. "We take the assessment of the British government (on the chemical attack) seriously and it is disappointing that Russia seems not to be willing to contribute to clearing up (this case)," Maas told foreign ministry staff and reporters. "Moscow should be ready to be transparent... And it is clear this cannot go without consequences," he said, adding that Germany would stay in close contact with its NATO ally Britain on the matter. "The perpetrators must be held accountable... We can fully understand why Britain had to react to this (attack)." Russia denies any involvement in the attack on Russian ex-double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. They were found unconscious on March 4 on a bench in the English city of Salisbury and remain in a critical condition in hospital. Prime Minister Theresa May announced earlier on Wednesday that Britain would kick out 23 Russian diplomats, the biggest expulsion since the Cold War, over the attack, which she blamed squarely on President Vladimir Putin. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other Western leaders have already condemned the attack and backed Britain's demands that Russia cooperate with the investigation. Maas said German foreign policy had had to adapt to a situation in which Russia increasingly defined itself as an antagonist to Western countries. "We continue to disapprove of Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and the ongoing aggression against Ukraine," he said, referring to a four-year conflict in eastern Ukraine between Kiev's forces and pro-Russian separatists. Maas, who was speaking after lawmakers re-elected Merkel as chancellor for a fourth, and likely final, term, said Germany must live up to its international responsibilities, and he vowed not to avoid confronting difficult issues. Germany, Europe's biggest economy, is facing calls to take a more active approach on issues ranging from euro zone reforms to the threat of U.S. trade sanctions and a more assertive Russia. Maas was due to hold talks in Paris later on Wednesday with his French counterpart. (Reporting by Sabine Siebold and Madeline Chambers, writing by Michael Nienaber Editing by Gareth Jones)
With head tax defeated, questions swirl around businesses’ response to homeless crisis  [SEP]  Starbucks plans a summit on family homelessness next week, but it remains to be seen what more the business community plans to do to address the region's ongoing crisis. After defeating the head tax, many Seattle businesses say they remain committed to addressing the region’s homelessness crisis, though the details of what more they’re willing to do are still materializing. Starbucks, for one, is hosting a summit focused on family homelessness next Tuesday at its Seattle headquarters, inviting government officials, business leaders and family service providers, facilitated by the consultant hired by the city of Seattle in 2016. Other businesses and business groups issued vague statements about the urgency of the matter, regional solutions, state and federal funding sources and a willingness to do more. The corporate response to the homelessness emergency can seem contradictory. On the one hand, businesses agree that the crisis is worsening and say something must be done. Many in the retail and services industries in particular encounter the crisis daily in their stores. But on the other hand, local businesses marshaled nearly $200,000 to fund the signature-gathering campaign that led to the Seattle City Council’s vote Tuesday to undo the tax. The council voted 7-2 just after 2 p.m. to repeal the tax, which would have generated an estimated $47 million a year. Seattle was expected to spend $71 million this year on its response to the crisis. That leaves homeless advocates and services providers wondering just how serious businesses are about addressing the crisis. “Every day, we turn clients away because we don’t have enough beds and we don’t have enough staff to provide long-term case management to clients in the system,” said Andrew Coak of the Downtown Emergency Service Center, in a statement distributed by the Bring Seattle Home coalition Tuesday. “On behalf of those clients, I implore the businesses who opposed the Employee Hours Tax to find a revenue stream and a plan you can support. It’s literally a matter of life or death for the people I work with.” Starbucks, which prides itself on good corporate citizenship, exemplifies the dichotomy. It contributed $25,000 to the No Tax on Jobs campaign, but has also channeled millions of dollars in the last two years to the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign focused on ending family homelessness, a slice of the broader unhoused population. The company’s employees regularly encounter people experiencing homelessness, and it recently changed corporate policies, allowing anyone to use its bathrooms and stay in its stores without making a purchase. The company’s Summit on Family Homelessness at its Sodo headquarters is to be facilitated by Barbara Poppe, who worked on homelessness in the Obama administration and was hired in 2016 by the city of Seattle to report and advise on its response to the crisis. Poppe’s recommendations have formed the basis for many of the city’s homeless strategies. Seattle and King County leaders “have a blueprint for reform recommended two years ago by their own experts,” John Kelly, Starbucks senior vice president of public affairs, said in a statement. “We do not need more reports, studies, or task forces. The solutions are available now. Family providers, business leaders and employers are ready and willing partners. What is missing is focus from the city and county coupled with a sense of urgency.” The Starbucks summit is one of a relative few venues for regional collaboration and dialogue about the way forward more than two-and-a-half years into the region’s homelessness emergency. Another is One Table, an effort begun early this year by King County Executive Dow Constantine, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, and Auburn Mayor Nancy Backus, to unify the region’s homelessness response. Businesses are represented among the 75-member One Table committee, and more expressed interest in being involved as the head tax repeal materialized this week. But One Table has so far been stunted. It did not have a quorum at its April meeting and has yet to schedule its next meeting. Editor’s note: While The Seattle Times Company would be affected by the head tax, and the editorial board has commented on it, The Times’ news coverage is separate from those functions and remains independent.
Trump rants about Russia probe, praises Manafort at West Virginia rally  [SEP]  Aug. 22 (UPI) -- In a visit to West Virginia Tuesday night, President Donald Trump addressed the fall midterm vote, his criticism of news media and the Russia investigation. Trump spoke at a rally Tuesday night in Charleston for Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey. He appeared just hours after former personal attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to 8 counts and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted for bank fraud. The Manafort and Cohen outcomes might have an impact on the Justice Department's Russia investigation, which is looking for any evidence of collusion between Trump's campaign and the Russian government. Trump has repeatedly denounced the inquiry and called it a "witch hunt" -- themes he again touched on at the rally. "Fake news. How fake are they?" he said, pointing to news cameras at the back of the Charleston Convention Center. "Fake news and the Russian witch hunt. We've got a whole, big combination. "Where is the collusion? You know, they're still looking for collusion! Where is the collusion? Find some collusion. We want to find the collusion." Trump called Manafort a "good man" who worked for previous Republican presidential candidates Ronald Reagan and Bob Dole. "He was with a lot of different people over the years and I feel very sad about that," he said. "Doesn't involve me but I still feel, you know, it's a very sad thing that happened. Had nothing to do with Russian collusion. We continue the witch hunt." The president, though, did not address Cohen. Later, Trump met with supporters for a fundraiser and held a 75-minute rally for Morrisey, the GOP senate candidate challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who has often aligned with Trump and Republicans as a representative of the coal-rich state. Trump is scheduled to appear at several "Make America Great Again" rallies and more than a dozen fundraisers in the next six weeks. In his visit, Trump touched on other issues -- like ESPN opting not to broadcast the national anthem before football games and players who kneel in protest. "So, while the players are kneeling, some of them, not all, you're all proudly standing for our national anthem," Trump said. "Under our administration, America is winning again and America is being respected again all over the world. All over the world it's America first." His visit to coal country came on the same day his Environmental Protection Agency moved to scrap an Obama-era rule that would have placed limits on emissions at coal plants. Trump has long praised fossil fuels and pledged to revive the coal industry in the United States, a position that's drawn widespread international criticism. "We love clean, beautiful West Virginia coal," Trump said. "We love it."
College Basketball FBI: Players & NCAA Teams Listed in Yahoo’s Investigation  [SEP]  Yahoo Sports’ Pat Forde and Pete Thamel released a new report showing the FBI investigation goes well beyond the handful of teams and players initially named. According to Yahoo Sports, a new investigation shows 20 college basketball programs along with more than 25 players are connected to potential NCAA recruiting violations. It remains to be seen how much access the NCAA has to the FBI documents, and whether they will discipline programs in time for the upcoming 2018 NCAA tournament. Yahoo includes photos of spreadsheets associated with former NBA agent Andy Miller and his agency, ASM Sports, where players are listed next to terms like “loan”, “flight” and “ATM withdrawl”. One of the big names listed in the report is Michigan State’s Miles Bridges, whose mother is alleged to have received benefits from ASM Sports. The report also lists current NBA players including Dennis Smith Jr., Markelle Fultz, “Bam” Adebayo, Josh Jackson, Kyle Kuzma, Malcolm Brogdon and Fred VanVleet. The report lists a number of marquee programs including Duke, North Carolina, Kentucky and Michigan State. Kentucky President Eli Capilouto released a statement to the Lexington Herald-Leader after Yahoo’s report was released. “We learned late last night of a report from Yahoo Sports that provides more details regarding documents related to the federal investigation of potential NCAA violations,” Capilouto told the Lexington Herald-Leader. “We began immediately to conduct our due diligence and we will cooperate fully with any appropriate authorities. That is our commitment as a university to our Board of Trustees and to the Commonwealth.” Yahoo described the nature of their investigation at the beginning of the report. Yahoo’s investigation differs from the FBI investigation in that Yahoo names specific programs and players. The FBI investigation was more vague as terms like “Coach 1” and “Coach 2” were used in the documents to identify coaches. Yahoo reports the potential violations range from “basic meals to tens of thousands of dollars.” ESPN’s Jeff Goodman reported that Miller’s ties to college basketball was widely known around the country. “Many coaches have been complaining about Andy Miller’s involvement with their players for years. Other coaches have had strong relationships with Andy Miller for years,” Goodman tweeted. Some critics are quick to point out that this bombshell report is as much of an indictment on the NCAA as it is on the universities. “Dear Mark Emmert: The problem is your NCAA rulebook. As long as you hold tight to amateurism, and deny student-athletes the ability to secure representation, or accept fair-market value, this black market will never go away no matter how many smart people you put on a committee,” CBS Sports analyst Gary Parrish tweeted. Here’s a rundown of the players and schools named in Yahoo’s investigation. List of Former College Basketball Players Named in Yahoo’s Report

Gibson files for bankruptcy, with a deal to renew its guitar business  [SEP]  A restructuring support agreement with senior secured noteholders will help it repay bank loans while going through a "change of control" transaction, according to papers filed Tuesday with its Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware. The petition estimated up to $500 million in debt, and the lenders have agreed to an operating, or "debtor in possession," loan of up to $135 million to fund operations.
Austrian women celebrate country's first same-sex marriage  [SEP]  BERLIN (AP) — Two Austrian women are the first same-sex couple to officially tie the knot in the predominantly Catholic country, following years of legal challenges from gay rights groups. Public broadcaster ORF reported Tuesday that Nicole Kopaunik and Daniela Paier wed in a ceremony in Velden, southern Austria, shortly after midnight Tuesday. The couple, both 37, had reportedly been engaged for four years. Austria's constitutional court ruled in 2017 that same-sex couples should have the right to marry from Jan. 1, 2019. Previously, same-sex couples could only enter into a registered partnership that granted fewer rights than marriage. Austria's current governing parties, the People's Party and the Freedom Party, had strongly opposed granting same-sex couples the right to marry, but said they would respect the court's ruling.

3.7 billion-year-old bacteria may hold key to finding life on other planets  [SEP]  HOUSTON - Scientists have found traces of bacteria living more than 3.7 billion years ago, an age that would make them — if confirmed — the oldest-known fossils and bolster the idea that life got off to a running start on Earth, and perhaps elsewhere. The bacteria lived near hydrothermal vents, cracks in the seafloor that gush hot, mineral-laden water into the open ocean, say the scientists who identified the fossils. Verification of the finding could make ocean vents on other planets in the solar system a key target in the search for extraterrestrial life. “It’s exciting to find life had managed to get a grip and start to evolve on Earth so quickly after the planets formed,” says Matthew Dodd of Britain’s University College London, co-author of a study in this week’s Nature that describes the fossils. “It gives me … high hopes of finding life elsewhere in the universe.” The rock in which the fossils reside is at least 3.77 billion years old and could be 4.28 billion years old. The next-oldest confirmed fossil is 3.5 billion years old, the study says. Last year, scientists reported the discovery of stromatolites — formations built by ancient microbes — dating to 3.7 billion years ago. When Dodd began examining slivers of rock collected from northeastern Quebec, he saw something strange: thread-like filaments half as wide as a human hair and slightly thicker cylinder-shaped tubes. Both filaments and tubes were composed of an iron-rich mineral. Similar filaments are excreted by modern bacteria that consume iron, says co-author Dominic Papineau, also of University College London. Such filaments and tubes have also been seen in much younger “microfossils,” named because of their microscopic size, found in Norwegian rocks. The researchers also spotted rosette-shaped formations, which the scientists argue could have blossomed through a chemical process that began with rotting bacteria. The rosettes are freckled with dots and shards of other chemicals linked to life, such as phosphorus, a key ingredient for biological activity. The rock formations around the fossils hint that the microbes lived on the seafloor around hydrothermal vents or in the water near vents. Like modern iron-dependent bacteria, they “would have literally ‘eaten’ the iron … in the same sense that we eat cake,” Papineau says, adding the bacteria could have formed rust-colored mats like those seen today. The researchers collected multiple forms of evidence to back their claim, which strengthens their case, says Christopher House of the Pennsylvania State University, who was not involved in the study. Though the data are less definitive than the evidence for life in younger rocks, he says, this “may be as good as it gets for as old as these rocks are.” “There’s enough in here to get me interested but not enough to make me convinced,” says Michael Tice of Texas A&M University, who also wasn’t part of the study. He questions, for instance, the study’s claim that the microfossils lived near a hydrothermal vent, which could influence where scientists send robots to look for signs of life on Mars. The rocks’ chemistry doesn’t necessarily signal a location near a vent, he says. Dodd says the rocks around the fossil-containing layers contain chemical signatures of a hydrothermal vent. The evidence so far, he says, raises the possibility that life arose on Jupiter’s watery moon Europa or even closer to home. “You have life on Earth at a time when we believe there was liquid water on the surface of Mars, and the atmosphere wouldn’t have been too drastically different,” Dodd says. “Maybe there was life on Mars in the past and we have yet to find it.”
1 dead, 5 injured after cars burst into flames on Brooklyn Bridge  [SEP]  It happened Wednesday around 7:15 a.m. when two vehicles traveling on the Brooklyn-bound side of the bridge crashed into another vehicle, causing them to spin out of control, the New York Times reported.
Harvey Weinstein accused of forcible sex act by a 3rd woman  [SEP]  NEW YORK — Harvey Weinstein was charged with a sex crime against a third woman, who claims the Hollywood mogul performed a forcible sex act on her in 2006. Manhattan’s district attorney announced the charges in an updated indictment Monday. The new charges join previous ones alleging forcible sex acts in 2004 and 2013. A representative for Weinstein had no immediate comment. The updated indictment alleges that he “engaged in oral sex by forcible compulsion” around July 10, 2006. “A Manhattan grand jury has now indicted Harvey Weinstein on some of the most serious sexual offenses that exist under New York’s penal law,” District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said in a statement. “This indictment is the result of the extraordinary courage exhibited by the survivors who have come forward. Our investigation continues. If you are a survivor of the predatory abuse with which Mr. Weinstein is charged, there is still time to pursue justice.” Weinstein was not expected to have a court appearance on Monday, the prosecutor’s office said. The district attorney’s representatives did not identify the accuser in the updated charges. One of the alleged victims in the criminal case, who has not been identified publicly, told investigators that Weinstein cornered her in a hotel room and raped her. The other accuser, former actress Lucia Evans, has gone public with her account of Weinstein forcing her to perform oral sex at his office in 2004. The Associated Press does not identify alleged victims of sexual assaults unless they come forward publicly. More than 75 women have accused Weinstein of wrongdoing. Several actresses and models accused him of criminal sexual assaults, including film actress Rose McGowan, who said Weinstein raped her in 1997 in Utah, “Sopranos” actress Annabella Sciorra, who said he raped her in her New York apartment in 1992, and the Norwegian actress Natassia Malthe, who said he attacked her in a London hotel room in 2008. New York City police detectives said in early November that they were investigating allegations by another accuser, “Boardwalk Empire” actress Paz de la Huerta, who told police in October that Weinstein raped her twice in 2010. Weinstein has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex, with his attorney challenging the credibility of his alleged victims. Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Researchers from the U.S., Japan win Nobel for cancer research  [SEP]  David Keyton And Jim Heintz, The Associated Press STOCKHOLM -- The Nobel Prize in medicine was awarded Monday to two researchers from the United States and Japan for advances in discovering how the body's immune system can fight off the scourge of cancer. The 9-million-kronor ($1.01 million) prize will be shared by James Allison of the University of Texas Austin and Tasuku Honjo of Kyoto University. Their parallel work concerned proteins that act as brakes on the body's immune system and it constitutes "a landmark in our fight against cancer," said a statement from the Nobel Assembly of Sweden's Karolinska Institute, which selects winners of the annual prestigious award. Allison studied a known protein and developed the concept into a new treatment approach, whereas Honjo discovered a new protein that also operated as a brake on immune cells. "I'm honoured and humbled to receive this prestigious recognition," Allison said in a statement released by the university's MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, where he is a professor. "A driving motivation for scientists is simply to push the frontiers of knowledge. I didn't set out to study cancer, but to understand the biology of T cells, these incredible cells that travel our bodies and work to protect us," he said. Last year's prize went to three Americans for work in identifying genes and proteins that work in the body's biological clock, which affects functions such as sleep patterns, blood pressure and eating habits. The physics prize is to be announced Tuesday, followed by chemistry. The winner of the Nobel Peace Prize will be named Friday and the economics laureate will be announced next Monday. No literature prize is being given this year.
South Korea Says North Korea Test Fires Missile Into Sea  [SEP]  South Korea's military said Sunday that North Korea fired a projectile into its eastern sea, a likely effort to advance its weapons program while also challenging the young Trump administration in Washington. The South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement that the projectile was fired from an area in the country's western region around Banghyon, North Pyongan Province, which is where South Korean officials have said the country test launched its powerful midrange missile Musudan on Oct. 15 and 20. An official from Seoul's Defense Ministry says it isn't clear whether the projectile was a ballistic missile. The official didn't want to be named, citing office rules. The North conducted two nuclear tests and a slew of rocket launches last year in continued efforts to expand its nuclear weapons and missile programs. Kim Dong-yeop, an analyst at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, said that the projectile could be a Musudan or a similar rocket designed to test engines for an intercontinental ballistic missile that could hit the U.S. mainland. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said in his annual New Year's address that the North's preparations for launching an intercontinental ballistic missile have "reached the final stage."
Suspected warlord killed in Russia's Dagestan  [SEP]  MAKHACHKALA, Russia -- A warlord suspected to be behind multiple attacks in the North Caucasus and four of his accomplices have been killed in a police operation in Dagestan, local police said Sunday. The five were killed late Saturday on the outskirts of the regional capital, Makhachkala, in a gunbattle with security forces, police spokeswoman Fatina Ubaydatova said. Russian state television showed special and armored vehicles taking up positions to surround a two-story house nestled at the foot of mountains that flank Makhachkala to the west. The regional office of the Russian Investigative Committee identified one of the five as 35-year old Rustam Aselderov, who was wanted for his suspected role in several attacks, including a double bombing in 2013 on a bus and at a train station in southern Russia that killed a total of 34 people. Dagestan, a predominantly Muslim province on the western shore of the Caspian Sea, has become the epicenter of an Islamic insurgency following two separatist wars in neighboring Chechnya. Despite government efforts to clamp down on the insurgency, shootouts and bombings are routine. Russian security agency FSB said in a statement on Sunday that Aselderov, although operating in Dagestan, pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in 2014. The FSB posted a long list of suicide attacks in Dagestan and bombings elsewhere that Aselderov was suspected to have masterminded including a foiled suicide attack by two women on Red Square in Moscow on New Year's Eve in 2010.
At least 44 killed as dam bursts in Kenya and sweeps away hundreds of homes  [SEP]  NAIROBI, Kenya – Villagers said it started with a loud rumble, then houses collapsed one by one under an approaching wall of water. “We took our children and rushed to higher ground,” farmer Joseph Maina told The Associated Press. Their home was submerged and their crops were washed away but unlike dozens of others, they survived. At least 44 were dead and another 40 were missing Thursday after a dam swollen by weeks of seasonal rains burst in Kenya’s Rift Valley, sweeping away hundreds of homes and sending people fleeing, officials said. At least 20 of the dead were children. “Many people are missing. It is a disaster,” said Rongai town police chief Joseph Kioko. The bursting of the Patel Dam in Solai, Nakuru County, on Wednesday night was the deadliest single incident yet in the seasonal rains that have killed more than 170 people in Kenya since March. The floods hit as the East African nation was recovering from a severe drought that affected half of the country. Almost an entire village was swept away by silt and water from the burst dam, said Gideon Kibunja, the county police chief in charge of criminal investigations. Officials said homes over a radius of nearly 1.2 miles were submerged. Forty people have been reported missing, Regional Commissioner Mwongo Chimwanga said, while about 40 others were rescued from the mud and taken to local hospitals. The area has seven dams used by a commercial farm, said Keffa Mageni, an official with an advocacy group that helps to resettle displaced people. With the heavy seasonal rains the dams do not have an outlet, he said. “There are two other dams which are leaking,” one resident, Stephen Nganga, said. He asked the government to investigate them for the residents’ safety. Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiangi, visiting the scene, said the government had launched investigations to determine the stability of the other dams. Nakuru County Governor Lee Kinyanjui said water from one of the other dams will be discharged to avoid a disaster and that a village near that dam will be evacuated. More than 225,000 people in Kenya have been displaced from their homes since March, according to the government. Military helicopters and personnel in the past week have been deployed to rescue people marooned by the flooding. The dam burst has again raised concerns about the state of Kenya’s infrastructure. The National Construction Authority in the past has blamed contractors of bypassing building codes to save on cost. In April 2016 a residential building in the capital, Nairobi, collapsed during rains, killing 52 people. Last May the wall of a hospital collapsed due to rains, killing six people in Kenya’s second largest city, Mombasa.
Scandal hearings put SKorea tycoons in hot seat  [SEP]  SEOUL: South Korea lawmakers on Monday kicked off an unprecedented series of hearings that will see the country’s business elite grilled over a corruption scandal engulfing impeachment-threatened President Park Geun-Hye. The powerful heads of family-run conglomerates, or “chaebols,” such as Samsung and Hyundai will be among those testifying before a parliamentary investigation ahead of an impeachment vote to remove the president on Friday. The hearings opened on the back of a series of mass anti-Park demonstrations in Seoul that have seen millions of people take to the streets. Park is accused of colluding with her long-time friend, Choi Soon-Sil, to strong-arm giant corporations into “donating” nearly $70 million to two dubious non-profit foundations. Choi has been indicted for coercion and abuse of power, and is accused of siphoning some of the donated funds for personal use. She denies all criminal charges. Choi had been summoned for questioning at the televised hearings, but made it clear Monday she would absent herself, citing health grounds. Lawmakers said she faced jail time for contempt if she failed to appear. Tuesday’s testimony will be devoted to interrogating the corporate tycoons, including Samsung group scion Lee Jae-Yong, Hyundai chairman Chung Mong-Koo and seven heads of other conglomerates like LG, Lotte, Hanjin and CJ. They are among the wealthiest and most powerful people in the country, but the “Choi-gate” scandal has taken the lid off simmering public resentment over their influence and perceived sense of privilege at a time of slowing economic growth According to company sources cited by the largest-circulation newspaper, Chosun Ilbo, many of them have been going through frantic preparations to avoid any public humiliation, holding mock question and answer sessions with aides and memorizing responses to sensitive issues. Some researched subway and bus fares in case they are asked to prove their common-touch credentials, while others sent managers on recess to the national assembly—timing the walk to the hearing room and working out routes to avoid the press, Chosun said. Chaebol heads are unused to being questioned or held accountable—even to their shareholders. “It is part of the deep-rooted, twisted corporate culture in South Korea to treat founding family members as if they are royalty,” said Shim Jung-Taik, an author of several books on Samsung and its corporate culture including a biography of its ailing chairman, Lee Kun-Hee. “None of them would have attended these hearings in normal times. But the public fury shown at recent mass rallies was too much to ignore even for these royals,” Shim said. Samsung—the South’s largest business group—made the biggest contributions of 20 billion won ($17 million) to Choi’s foundations, followed by Hyundai, SK, LG and Lotte. Prosecutors have raided the headquarters of Samsung and other groups for any evidence that they received policy favors in exchange for their contributions. Samsung is separately accused of funneling millions of euros to Choi to bankroll her daughter’s equestrian training in Germany. As part of the widening probe, prosecutors are also investigating whether Samsung lobbied officials at the state pension fund for their support over a contested merger deal last year. Park has not been summoned for questioning by lawmakers. Monday’s session involved several presidential aides who were grilled over some of the more lurid elements uncovered by the case—including the mass purchase by Park’s office of Viagra pills. The officials said the erectile-dysfunction drug had been bought to treat potential altitude sickness during Park’s tour of various African nations in May. In order to secure the required two-thirds majority, the opposition-sponsored impeachment motion will need the support of more than two-dozen lawmakers from Park’s ruling Saenuri Party. Saenuri rebels have sent mixed messages on how they might vote, but in the wake of another huge street protest on Saturday, signaled that they were likely to come down on the side of impeachment. The party’s official proposal that Park be allowed to step down voluntarily in April has met with public anger, and a torrent of text messages and e-mails urging its members to oust the president. “I get a text message every single second,” said Saenuri legislator Lee Eun-Jae.

Islamic State claims responsibility for attack in Kabul, killing more than 40  [SEP]  Islamic State claims responsibility for an attack by a suicide bomber outside a voter registration centre in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing 48 people and wounding 112 others as they waited to receive identity cards. Islamic State has claimed responsibility for a blast that hit a voter registration centre in the Afghan capital Kabul, the militant group's AMAQ news agency said. The blast, carried out by a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest, killed at least 31 people and wounded 54 others, a health ministry spokesman said. The attack targeted a project of key importance to the credibility of President Ashraf Ghani's Western-backed Government, which has pledged to hold parliamentary elections this year. Interior Ministry spokesman Najib Danesh said a bomber on foot approached the centre where officials had been issuing identity cards as part of a process of registering voters for the election scheduled for October. The explosion destroyed cars and shattered windows in nearby buildings, leaving rubble strewn across the street. The blast took place in Dasht-e Barchi, an area of western Kabul inhabited by many members of the mainly Shi'ite Hazara minority, which has been repeatedly hit by attacks claimed by Islamic State. Voter registration centres have been set up across Afghanistan ahead of long-delayed parliamentary and district council elections and there have been serious concerns militants might attack them. Mr Ghani has been under heavy pressure from his international partners to ensure the elections are held this year, ahead of a presidential election due in 2019 although there has been widespread scepticism they will take place. Unless the process of registering millions of voters, many of whom do not have national identity cards, can be completed before winter sets, the vote would almost certainly have to be postponed until next year.
New Zealand police: 22-year-old British tourist was murdered  [SEP]  WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand police say they believe a 22-year-old British tourist who has been missing for a week was murdered, and they are questioning a man in relation to her disappearance. Grace Millane was on a planned yearlong trip abroad that began in Peru. She arrived in New Zealand last month and was last seen on Dec. 1 entering a central Auckland hotel with a 26-year-old man. Police say they brought that man into the central Auckland police station on Saturday afternoon for questioning. Detective Inspector Scott Beard said he has told Millane's devastated father, David Millane, who this week traveled from Britain, that they believe Millane was killed. Beard says they don't know where Millane's body is located but they're determined to find it and return it to her family.
Lawmakers Approve Moving California Presidential Primary To March  [SEP]  SACRAMENTO (CBS/AP) — California lawmakers voted early Saturday to set the state’s presidential primary in March, a move that would force candidates to mount expensive campaigns earlier in the state that awards the most delegates. The bill will go to Gov. Jerry Brown for consideration. He has not said if he will sign it. The bill would move the presidential primary to the Tuesday after the first Monday in March — three months earlier than the June contest held in 2016, when Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump were already the presumptive nominees. A March primary would likely fall on so-called “Super Tuesday,” when roughly a dozen states typically vote following the early primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and several other states. “Candidates will have to spend more time in California,” said Democratic Assemblyman Kevin Mullin of San Francisco. An earlier primary could give an edge to well-funded candidates. California is home to 11 media markets, making it expensive to campaign. It’s easier for candidates with limited money to compete alongside financial heavy-hitters in early primary states such as Iowa and New Hampshire. In 2016, for example, John Kasich took second in New Hampshire with limited money, while Jeb Bush, who had more than $100 million, placed fourth. “The cost of playing in California versus playing in New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina is incredibly different,” said Mike Biundo, Republican Rick Santorum’s 2012 campaign manager who later worked for Kasich and Trump. “A Jeb Bush or a Hillary Clinton, I think, have the advantage if California is earlier.” An earlier primary, especially one held on Super Tuesday, wouldn’t mean every candidate will spend more time in the state. In 2016, for example, Texas, Colorado, Massachusetts, Virginia and eight other states voted that day. And it doesn’t ensure the political relevance that California lawmakers crave. The last time California voted early — in February 2008 — the state backed Clinton, but Barack Obama went on to win the Democratic nomination and the presidency. California’s last truly relevant presidential primary was perhaps in 1972, when George McGovern defeated Hubert Humphrey on McGovern’s way to winning the Democratic nomination. Michael Schroeder, Republican Ted Cruz’s California political director in 2016, said it’s too early in the political calendar to predict the impact of an earlier primary in 2020. “Right now, California is completely irrelevant for picking presidents. We didn’t pick Hillary (Clinton) and we didn’t pick (President Donald) Trump,” he said, referring to 2016 contests that were essentially settled before the state voted. Changing the date “will make us at least somewhat relevant; it could make us very relevant,” he said. The Republican and Democratic national committees have not yet set rules for the 2020 contests, including the preferred primary calendar and delegates awarded to each state. Depending on rules set, other states could attempt to leapfrog ahead of California, pushing the entire primary season earlier. California historically awards more delegates than any other state. California may also become the first state to require presidential candidates to release their tax returns to appear on the state ballot. Lawmakers sent Brown a bill Friday requiring candidates to publicly share five years of returns; he hasn’t said if he’ll sign it. President Donald Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns during the 2016 sparked similar legislation in dozens of states from New Jersey to Hawaii. The documents reveal income sources, tax exemptions, charitable donations and potential financial conflicts of interest. Until Trump, every major presidential candidates has released his or hers for decades. © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Police ticket driver in Dartmouth for illegally travelling with open cannabis  [SEP]  A man was ticketed by Halifax District RCMP the day after recreational cannabis became legal in Canada for illegally transporting cannabis in his car. Cpl. Dal Hutchinson, a spokesman for the organization, said the $295 ticket was issued at 2:30 a.m. on Thursday in Dartmouth, N.S., and the cannabis was purchased from an NSLC store the evening before. The cannabis was in an opened package on the centre console, he said, and the driver was not found to have been impaired by drugs or alcohol. Hutchinson said, under the Cannabis Control Act, cannabis must be sealed and kept out of reach of everyone in a vehicle. Cannabis contained in a glove compartment would be considered within reach of the driver, he added. The driver was also given another ticket for no registration and no insurance for the car.
Super Weekend Down Under: grand finals in 2 football leagues  [SEP]  It's grand final weekend for the two biggest football leagues in Australia: One team will try to win a championship after losing the final last year; one of the others hasn't been in a title match for 35 years. Cue up the championship-starved Richmond Tigers against the Adelaide Crows on Saturday in the Australian Football League final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The Tigers haven't won an Australian Rules football title since 1980, and lost to Carlton when they last appeared in a grand final in 1982. On Sunday, the Melbourne Storm, who lost the National Rugby League final last year to Cronulla, take on the upstart North Queensland Cowboys in their title match at Sydney's Olympic stadium. The Cowboys have proven to be the surprises of the NRL playoffs, making the final from the eighth and final playoff spot and upsetting three teams along the way to the championship match. The AFL final should attract around 95,000 to the MCG, the NRL championship match about 80,000: Here are a few other things to know about the ultimate football games on Australian sport's calendar. NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY: The last time an AFL grand final featured no players with experience in a championship match was the first one — in 1898. The Crows lead the Tigers 23-12 in head-to-head matches, and Adelaide won by 76 points when the teams last met, in Adelaide in the sixth round in April this year. Adelaide hasn't competed for the title since 1998, still a far cry from Richmond's generational gap. "There's no doubt we go in as underdogs, that's the harsh reality of it," Richmond coach Damien Hardwick said. ADVANTAGE MELBOURNE: The Storm have won 25 of their 35 matches against North Queensland, including 26-8 when the teams met a month ago in Townsville. But the Cowboys have become only the second team to qualify for the grand final from eighth place. "They've continued to work hard and tried to get better as a team," Cowboys coach Paul Green said. "There was a period there where we weren't getting it right ... they stuck to their guns and I kept telling them eventually our luck will turn." THE STARS: Richmond will be led by midfielder Dustin Martin, who won the Brownlow Medal earlier this week as the AFL's best and fairest player. Melbourne clinched first place in the NRL with three rounds to spare, and the Storm hope to send off retiring halfback Cooper Cronk as a premiership winner. Melbourne will be led by veteran captain Cameron Smith, who became the oldest player at 34 to win the Dally M Medal as the best player in the league on Wednesday. THE TIPS: Adelaide and Melbourne go in as favourites but the big sentimental bets are going with the Tigers, who have fans with a lifetime of suffering waiting for a grand final win. And, of course, the surprising Cowboys from North Queensland. There's no doubt who Australian golfer Karrie Webb will be supporting — her hometown of Ayr is about an hour's drive south of Townsville, the home of the Cowboys. She's been a vocal supporter of the team for years and has been tweeting her congratulations from international destinations and her home in Florida. "Grand finals baby!!," Webb tweeted after North Queensland beat the Sydney Roosters 29-16 in the semifinals last Saturday. "Well done Boys! Bring on the Storm!!"
Yulia Skripal, daughter of poisoned Russian spy, discharged from hospital – WFIN  [SEP]  ABC News(LONDON) — The poisoned daughter of a former Russian spy has reportedly been discharged from hospital after being targeted with a suspected nerve agent alongside her father. Hospital officials said Yulia Skripal, 33, left the hospital early on Tuesday morning having made a rapid recovery after spending almost a month unconscious and in critical condition. A statement delivered by Salisbury Hospital Medical Director Christine Blanshard said they “wish Yulia well,” but said “this is not the end of her treatment.” “Yulia has asked for privacy from the media and I want to reiterate that request,” Blanshard said. Yulia and her father Sergei, 66, were found slumped on a park bench in the English city of Salisbury on March 4. Blanshard said Sergei has also made “excellent” progress and they hoped he would also be released from the hospital “in due course.” Assessments by the British government concluded they were attacked with a type of Russian nerve agent known as Novichok. Russia has fiercely denied allegations it is responsible and accused the Brits of fabricating the attack. Doctors at Salisbury District Hospital said last week that Yulia Skripal was “responding well to treatment, improving rapidly and no longer in a critical condition.” “Our job in treating the patients has been to stabilise them — ensuring that the patients could breathe and that blood could continue to circulate,” Blanshard said Tuesday morning of the treatments used to save Yulia and her father. “We then needed to use a variety of different drugs to support the patients until they could create more enzymes to replace those affected by the poisoning.” Shortly after the hospital’s announcement, it emerged that Yulia may have spoken to her cousin in Russia by phone. A recording which purported to be of the conversation was aired on Russian television, consisting of a brief conversation between the two, with Yulia saying she did not think her cousin would be given a visa to enter the U.K. to visit her. Over the weekend the British press reported the Skripals may be resettled in one of the western countries involved in the “five-eyes” intelligence-sharing community — the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia or New Zealand.
Huge crowd bids farewell to Iranian ex-president who fell out with supreme leader | Reuters  [SEP]  DUBAI Hundreds of thousands of Iranians massed in central Tehran on Tuesday for the funeral of former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, an influential figurehead of the Islamic Republic whose pragmatism led to a rift with Iran's supreme leader.Rafsanjani, who died on Sunday aged 82, was buried next to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979 who founded its system of theocratic rule. Rafsanjani's policies of economic liberalisation and better relations with the West attracted fierce supporters and equally fierce critics during his life.While many of his opponents turned out to honour him, and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stressed their close bond, what was intended by the state as a show of unity was clouded by the chants of thousands opposition supporters, as well as the absence of reformist ex-president Mohammad Khatami.An eyewitness told Reuters on the phone from Tehran: "Some were chanting slogans asking for political prisoners to be released, some hardliners were shouting 'Death to America!'. But they didn't clash. Everyone was respectful."Some of the chants called for the release of former prime minister Mir Hossein Mousavi and of Mehdi Karoubi, a cleric and former speaker of parliament who lost the disputed 2009 presidential election to incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.Both men refused to accept the results of that election and were placed under house arrest while Rafsanjani, who had backed them, was politically isolated along with his family.KHATAMI ABSENT Two separate sources said Hashemi's daughter Faezeh, jailed for six months in 2012 on charges of anti-government propaganda, had told people at the funeral that Khatami had been banned from attending. On state television's live coverage, the opposition chants were drowned out by solemn music.As a leading power-broker, Rafsanjani helped Khamenei to secure Iran's most powerful position, that of supreme leader, after Khomeini's death in 1989, and won election as president himself a few months later.However, their friendship gradually turned into rivalry as Rafsanjani, who continued to wield enormous influence even after his eight years as president ended, sided with reformists who promoted greater freedom, while Khamenei interpreted the values of the Islamic Republic much more conservatively. In his condolence message, Khamenei said political differences had never been able to "entirely break up" their nearly 60 years of friendship. Streets were filled overnight with billboards that showed a picture of the two men smiling and chatting as close friends. "No one will be like Hashemi for me," the billboards quoted Khamenei as saying, using Rafsanjani's first family name.KHAMENEI'S PRAYER It was Khamenei who said the final prayer over Rafsanjani's body in the University of Tehran courtyard where the late president delivered many of his sermons during Friday prayers. Politicians, military commanders and religious figures from all camps stood behind him.President Hassan Rouhani, the head of parliament, the head of the judiciary and senior Khamenei advisers stood in the first line at the service, while cabinet ministers and the deceased leader's relatives filled the rows behind them.Rafsanjani's body, sealed in a metal coffin with his white turban on top, was then brought in procession down Revolution Street in central Tehran, where hundreds of thousands of people came out in cold winter weather to pay tribute.Among those attending were Revolutionary Guards Commander Qassem Soleimani, leading Iranian Sunni cleric Molavi Abdolhamid Ismaeelzahi, several of Khomeini's grandsons and even a number of Iranian movie stars.Rafsanjani's death is a blow to Rouhani, whom he had backed in the 2013 presidential election and who now faces re-election having resolved Iran's long nuclear standoff with the West but shown little of the economic payoff that he had promised.Rouhani's deputy chief of staff, Hamid Aboutalebi, tweeted: "The glorious presence of people of Tehran in the funeral and their tearful farewell show that they will never forget Rafsanjani’s moderate thoughts and his allies." Rafsanjani was a member of the Assembly of Experts, the clerical body that selects the supreme leader. His absence from that debate, whenever it happens, means the chances of a pragmatist succeeding Khamenei are reduced.

Iran declares national mourning over demise of senior cleric  [SEP]  According to the news website of Iranian government ‘dolat.ir’, Wednesday Dec. 26 will be a national day of mourning throughout Iran as a mark of respect for the late Chairman of the Expediency Council Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, who passed away last night after a long-standing struggle with cancer. In a message issued on Tuesday, the Iranian government offered condolences on the demise of Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi to the Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Khamenei, the senior clergymen, seminaries, the honorable nation of Islamic Iran, and the family of the deceased cleric, and declared Wednesday as a national day of mourning.
100 evacuees killed in Syria bus convoy blast  [SEP]  RASHIDIN - A powerful blast ripped through a bus convoy carrying evacuees near the Syrian city of Aleppo on Saturday, killing at least 100 people and injuring 48 others, according to state media and rescuers who responded to the scene. Syrian state television said the convoy was hit by a suicide attacker with a car bomb. Pro-government activists claimed the vehicle used was a pick-up truck purporting to deliver food for the evacuees, LA Times reported. Mohammad Taqi Din, the head of the crisis committee for the towns of Foua and Kefraya, said in a WhatsApp message on Saturday that the number of dead had risen to 40. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Up to 5,000 evacuees had left a day earlier from Foua and Kefraya, a pair of Shiite-dominated towns in northwestern Syria, roughly 31 miles southwest of Aleppo, as part of a complex population swap brokered by Iran, Qatar and Turkey. The towns had been encircled for years by a loose coalition of hard-line Islamist rebels, including the faction Ahrar al Sham as well as the former Al Qaeda affiliate Organization for the Liberation of Syria (once known as the Nusra Front). Residents of Foua and Kefraya were joined by 2,350 others from Madaya, a rebel-held enclave that, along with the Damascene resort town Zabadani, had been besieged by pro-government forces, including the Lebanese paramilitary group Hezbollah. The United Nations described the situation in the four towns as a “looming humanitarian catastrophe,” where tens of thousands of civilians were “trapped in a cycle of daily violence and deprivation.” Officials brokered the “Four Towns Agreement,” which saw limited amounts of aid alleviate acute shortages of food and medicine, before a final evacuation was pushed through earlier this week. Evacuees had been waiting for more than 24 hours in the Rashideen area, the last point of rebel control before government-held Aleppo. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a pro-opposition monitoring group that tracks the carnage in the country, said there had been some objection by the rebel factions involved in the deal. Mohammad Khair Hak, a pro-opposition cameraman who was at the gathering point of the buses, posted a video on his Facebook page purporting to show the aftermath of the blast. The camera lingers on the first buses in the convoy, their right side completely obliterated by what Hak described as a “huge explosion.” On the ground are the remains of corpses partially hidden by a motley collection of brightly coloured blankets. Somewhere in the distance a group of people shout “ambulance, ambulance,” while the camera captures the body of what appears to be a little boy hanging out the window of one of the buses. Many fear that the attack will scuttle the evacuation agreement, which had taken months to negotiate. Thousands still remain in the four towns. AFP adds: The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the vehicle exploded next to buses carrying residents evacuated from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya under a deal reached between the regime and rebels. The attack, in Rashidin, west of Aleppo, also wounded dozens, according to the Observatory and an AFP correspondent on the scene. "The suicide bomber was driving a van supposedly carrying aid supplies and detonated near the buses," the monitoring group said. AFP's reporter in rebel-held Rashidin saw several bodies, body parts and blood scattered on the ground. The bombing took place as thousands of evacuees from Fuaa and Kafraya waited to continue their journey to regime-controlled Aleppo, the coastal province of Latakia, or Damascus. Syria's war has left more than 320,000 people dead since erupting in 2011, with more than half the population forced from their homes and hundreds of thousands enduring siege-like conditions. It has sucked in regional and international powers and allowed militant groups to seize vast areas of the country. US-backed fighters reached the outskirts of a key militant-held town in northern Syria on Saturday as part of an offensive aimed at the IS bastion of Raqa. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an Arab-Kurdish alliance supported by US-led coalition air strikes and special forces advisers, surrounded Tabqa in early April and have cut its main supply routes. The town and a vast nearby dam are considered key prizes in the broader offensive for Raqa, the de facto Syrian capital of IS's self-proclaimed "caliphate", about 55 kilometres (34 miles) to the east. An SDF military source said Saturday that clashes were "at their height" and that the alliance's forces were "trying to penetrate the town from the east and west". The alliance was reported to have advanced overnight after driving the militants from two areas just southeast and southwest of the town. SDF fighters are within a few hundred metres (yards) of Tabqa, said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. He said heavy clashes were under way around the two suburbs as IS attempted to counter-attack. The SDF launched its campaign for Raqa in November and has since captured most of the surrounding province. It has been backed by US-led coalition air strikes, along with advisers and even an American Marines artillery battery. Raqa was home to around 240,000 residents before 2011 and more than 80,000 people have fled to the city from other parts of the country since the start of Syria's civil war. Tabqa sits on a key supply route into Raqa and served as an important IS command base, housing the group's main prison. Backed by Russia and local militias, pro-government forces have made a string of recent gains. The government and rebels have brokered a series of deals to evacuate people from besieged areas, which Damascus touts as the best way to end the violence. Rebels say they are forced out by siege and bombardment. The deal involving the evacuees targeted on Saturday has been beset by delays, and the 5,000 Fuaa and Kafraya residents had waited in Rashidin for more than a day without moving before the bomb went off, an AFP correspondent said. Around 2,220 evacuees from Madaya and Zabadani were similarly blocked at a transit point in government-held territory, one of them told AFP by telephone. State television said the car bombing had been carried out by "terrorist groups", a term the regime applies to all armed opposition groups. A rebel official confirmed there had been disagreement over the number of opposition fighters allowed to leave Madaya and Zabadani. Many residents had earlier expressed regret over not knowing when, if ever, they would be able to return to their homes. "It's terrible to be uprooted like this, to go and live in a place that is not ours," said Jama Nayef, a vet from Fuaa.

Brazil begins investigation into murder of 'uncontacted' tribe  [SEP]  RIO DE JANEIRO — A federal prosecutor in Brazil’s Amazonas state has launched an investigation into a reported massacre of at least 10 members of an “uncontacted” indigenous tribe by gold miners. Brazil's indigenous affairs agency, Funai, released a statement confirming that there is an investigation into the murder which allegedly took place along the Jandiatuba river, near Peru’s border. "There is an ongoing inquiry into the case but I cannot speak about its content in order to not prejudice the investigation,” federal prosecutor Pablo Beltrand told Reuters. If confirmed, the murders would be one of the largest massacres of ingenious people in Brazil since 16 Yanomami indigenous people were killed in 1993. Funai officials in Amazonas received an audio clip with miners bragging about the crime, said Gustavo Souza, acting coordinator of Funai’s ethno-environmental protection front at Vale do Javari, where the murders allegedly took place. Souza said he heard miners in the recording saying there were women and children on the river bank and they shot them. “In the audio, one of the miners said ‘you know, I do not mistake a shot’,” Souza said. He said he also saw a picture of a hand-crafted paddle that reportedly belonged to the indigenous tribe. “Indigenous lands are at risk amid increasing invasions and we’re afraid that it’ll get worse from now on." The number of invasions in indigenous lands in Vale do Javari has been increasing amid budget cuts — part of austerity measures aimed at lifting Brazil out of its worst recession in decades. Souza said although Vale do Javari is one of the largest indigenous reserves in the country, it is patrolled by just 10 Funai officials who are charged with monitoring the largest number of "uncontacted" indigenous people worldwide. Endangered indigenous tribes are increasingly facing threats from miners in the Amazon rainforest amid government budget cuts to the Brazilian agency responsible for protecting them, local officials and activists say. Carla de Lello Lorenzi, spokeswoman at indigenous rights group Survival International, said the cuts put indigenous lives at risk. “These tribes are completely vulnerable. If miners and loggers get into their land, they are very vulnerable to violence and diseases,” Lorenzi said.
Mental health matters  [SEP]  In any given week, 500,000 employed Canadians are unable to work due to a mental health issue. Depression, anxiety, PTSD, and other mental health conditions are increasingly responsible for disability claims and account for more than $6 billion in lost productivity due to absenteeism and “presenteeism.” In trucking, a worker who is on the job but not mentally present also poses a safety risk. We spend more hours at work than anywhere else, so it makes sense to say that our work environment has a significant effect on our overall mental well-being. At Trucking HR Canada, we have established a mental health initiative to help trucking and logistics employers find the resources, tools, and programs they need to develop a better understanding of how to develop a workplace culture that values mental health. On October 30, we will be hosting our first symposium on workplace mental health in Toronto. This half-day event will open with David Henry sharing his story as a driver who succeeded in overcoming various mental health challenges, and feature a panel discussion of subject matter experts who can provide employers with practical approaches they can bring back to their workplace. As we prepare for this event, here are some things we have already learned: The stigma of mental health is real For people living with mental health issues, the stigma they experience from friends, family, co-workers, and sometimes even the support system that they turn to for help is more devastating than the illness itself. We can do more to help. We need to identify how mental health can best be incorporated into overall workplace health, safety, and HR approaches. Prevention matters A workplace culture that supports work-life balance, fosters effective communication, and has systems in place to support employees can prevent the development of conditions that affect a person’s ability to relate to others and function each day. Making sure that employees are not chronically overworked, having policies that effectively address bullying or harassment, and ensuring that staff are equipped and trained to identify mental health issues early are important considerations. Do you have strategies and policies that are proactive about the mental health of your employees? Early engagement is crucial to a better outcome. The approach needs to be comprehensive Are you dealing with mental health issues on a case-by-case basis or do you have awareness programs, anti-stigma initiatives, and prevention initiatives that are part of an overall workplace initiative? How effectively does your employee assistance program support employees during their illness and re-entry into the workplace? As we look for ways to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health in our society and workplace, it’s important ensure that employees feel comfortable coming forward with their mental health problems and illnesses at work. And, workplaces that implement comprehensive approaches will be in a better position overall. You can learn more about our “Gearing Up for Workplace Mental Health” symposium at truckinghr.com. Hope to see you October 30th as the learning continues.
Ticketless PSG fans banned from travelling to Lille game  [SEP]  Paris St Germain fans who do not have tickets for the Ligue 1 opener against Lille on Friday have been banned from travelling to the area amid concerns about possible crowd trouble, local authorities said on Tuesday. They issued an order on Tuesday barring PSG fans without tickets from Villeneuve d'Ascq, home to the Pierre Mauroy stadium, where Lille play, and neighbouring Lezennes and Ronchin. The authorities said they feared crowd trouble, citing previous problems caused by PSG fans in recent years. Lille host the French champions on Friday at 1830 GMT.
United States Government Officially Shuts Down After Republicans, Democrats Fail to Strike Deal  [SEP]  After weeks of political posturing and debate, Congress failed to come to an agreement on a spending bill by the January 20, 2018 midnight deadline, resulting in non-essential government services shutting down effective immediately. A stopgap bill that passed the House would have avoided a government shutdown, but it failed to gain traction in the Senate, resulting in the first government shutdown under President Donald Trump’s tenure. In order to pass the Senate, a spending bill needs 60 votes. Currently, 51 Republicans hold office with the remaining 49 Senators being either Democrat or Independent (but aligning with liberal causes). However, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) is currently seeking treatment for cancer, leaving the Republicans with a 50-49 majority. Had the House-backed bill passed, the government would be fully funded through February 16, 2018 and the nonpartisan Children’s Health Insurance Program would be continued for six years. Instead, the government will be shut down indefinitely, causing government workers and civilians alike to fret about the potential ramifications. Illegal immigration was an issue that came to the forefront of the spending bill. Democrats aimed to shield the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, a group of approximately 800,000 illegal aliens that were brought to the United States as children, from deportation. The DACA program was created during President Barack Obama’s administration, and was carried out via executive order. In order to comply with President Trump’s immigration mandates — including funding for a border wall at the United States-Mexico border, and an end to the diversity lottery and chain migration — Democrats demanded legal protection and/or a path to citizenship for the DACA recipients, also known as “Dreamers.” Ultimately, the two parties were too far apart to reach a deal and the United States government will remain shut down until Congress passes a spending bill.

Cosmo DiNardo confesses to murders of 4 missing Bucks men  [SEP]  SOLEBURY TWP, PA >> The remains of Dean Finocchiaro, one of the four missing Bucks County men, has been recovered from a 12.5-foot-deep grave at a Solebury farm owned by the family of a man who is a person of interest. Meanwhile, Cosmo DiNardo has apologized and confessed to participating in the murder of the four men, according to his attorney Paul Lang. He told authorities where they can find the bodies of the other three men who have yet to be recovered. DiNardo gave his confession on the condition that prosecutors do not pursue the death penalty against him, Lang said. Bucks County District Attorney Matthew Weintraub just before midnight Wednesday held a press conference at a shopping center in the township to say authorities have found Finocchiaro’s remains. “I’m very sad to say that we can now identify Dean Finocchiaro, 19 years old, of Middletown, as one of the people that was found buried in that grave,” the district attorney said, noting the man has been missing since Friday. “There are additional human remains inside that grave. So this pain-staking process will go on. We’re not done yet. This is a homicide.” Jimi Taro Patrick, 19, of Newtown Township, was the first to go missing last Wednesday. That was followed by the disappearances of 22-year-old Mark Sturgis, of Pennsburg in Montgomery County, 21-year-old Tom Meo, of Plumstead Township, and Finocchiaro on Friday. “Make no mistake about it: We don’t know how many homicides,” Weintraub said. “We are yet to know the answer of that question. We’re going to see this investigation to the end. We’re going to bring each and every one of these lost boys home to their families, one way or another. We will not rest until we do that.” Cosmo DiNardo, who was named as a person of interest, was arrested Wednesday for stealing the car of Meo. DiNardo’s family owns the 90-acre property on the 6000 block of Lower York Road in Solebury where Finocchiaro’s remains were found. “We’re going to start looking seriously at the homicide charges and in fact we already have pursued that option,” Weintraub said, noting he could not comment on the type of homicide. Finocchiaro’s body was found by cadaver dogs, Weintraub said. “I don’t understand the science behind it, but those dogs could smell these four boys 12.5 feet under the ground,” the district attorney said, signaling bad news for the families of the missing men. Weintraub could not say if more people are involved. DiNardo’s family owns a construction and concrete business. “The investigation as you all know has taken two tracks: it’s been about recovery on one side and about ascertaining what actually occurred on the other side,” the district attorney said, noting the leads are hot. Weintraub later Thursday morning held another press conference where he did not reveal any new details on the case but acknowledged the large-scale police operation in which officers from cadets to State Police to FBI agents worked round-the-clock shifts in “dust-choked, sweltering heat” to find the remains. “They are side by side; they are combing through vast fields and buildings; they are down 12-feet deep in a hole that is getting deeper by the minute,” Weintraub said of the law-enforcement investigators. “They are tenderly, painstakingly, reverentially recovering the remains of people that they do not even know that they never even met. They don’t do this for glory or recognition. They do it because it’s their job. They are our unsung heroes but our heroes nonetheless.” Members of the news media asked Weintraub key questions of interest, but he had no comments to most of the questions. He would not say how many remains the investigators have recovered and would not speak about the connection between DiNardo and the four men who went missing. “I know more than I am sharing on the relationships,” Weintraub said, “and I have to keep it that way, unfortunately, to maintain the integrity of the investigation.” The district attorney at the 11 a.m. Thursday press conference said DiNardo “remains a person of interest” but also said he has “not even named a suspect yet” in the case that is now officially a homicide investigation with the discovery of Finocchiaro’s remains. The district attorney made those comments before DiNardo confessed. Weintraub Thursday morning expressed satisfaction with how police were developing the case, saying, “I am very pleased paradoxically with our progress, but I am not prepared to acknowledge that at this time.” The family of missing man Jimi Taro Patrick released a biography of their loved one on Thursday. The bio indicates that Jimi Taro Patrick attended Holy Ghost Prep high school in Bensalem, recently completed his freshman year at Loyola University in Maryland and has been working this summer at a restaurant in Buckingham, Pa. When asked how the family members of Finocchiaro and the missing men are holding up, Weintraub said they are doing “as best as can be expected.” Anyone with information on the case is urged to contact 1-800-CALL-FBI (225-5324) or to leave tips at tips.fbi.gov or BucksCrimeWatch.org. Weintraub canceled a second press conference that was scheduled for 3 p.m. Thursday. It was unclear whether a second press briefing would take place on Thursday, but there could be another press update in light of DiNardo’s confession.
India Steps Up Alert Amid Heightened Tensions With China  [SEP]  India has increased a military alert along its eastern border with China, moving troops and weapons into the region amid a weeks-long standoff between the two countries that shows no signs of resolution. As NPR's Julie McCarthy reported last month, New Delhi and Beijing have been at odds over a strategic region called the Doklam Plateau, which is claimed both by China and by India's tiny ally, Bhutan. In June, China began construction to extend a road there in an apparent effort to press its claim. In response, India sent troops as a show of force, sparking anger from China which says the affair is none of its business. Beijing demanded that Indian forces withdrawal, but Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has refused. India's Defense Minister Arun Jaitley told parliament this week that the country's armed forces are "fully prepared" in the event of conflict with China. Meanwhile, Reuters reports that Indian troops in Sikkim, south of Doklam, have been put on heightened alert, although the news agency quoted an unnamed source as saying it was "out of caution." In 1962, India and China fought a bloody month-long border war. The neighbors also have a continuing dispute over the sovereignty Aksai Chin, a Himalayan region on their extreme western border. Doklam is strategically close to a sliver of land called the "Chicken's Neck" that is India's only land corridor to its frequently restive northeast. The two countries have also long been at odds over India's hosting of Tibet's government-in-exile and their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, considered by China to be subversive.
Tel Aviv Summons Brussels Ambassador after Belgian PM Meets with Anti-Occupation HR Groups  [SEP]  Alwaght- Angered by Belgium's Prime Minister's meeting with two human rights group, Israeli regime's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered a reprimand of the Belgian Ambassador. Charles Michel during his visit to Israeli regime met on Wednesday with leaders of two Israeli human rights groups- Breaking the Silence; and the human rights watchdog B’Tselem- that reveal the Israeli army's abuses in occupied Palestinian territories. Referring to Belgian Prime Minister's meeting with the two human rights' head which was held despite a personal request from Israeli PM to stop supporting Israeli groups, Netanyahu’s office issued a statement, saying that "The Belgian government needs to decide whether it wants to change direction or continue with an anti-Israel line”. The Belgian ambassador, Olivier Belle, is set to be summoned to the Israeli Foreign Ministry on Thursday. Both human rights groups are known for uncovering cases of abuse of power by the Israeli Defense Force against Palestinians, such as random shootings of civilians. The groups constantly face accusations of denigrating Israel’s image, undermining its security and endangering the lives of soldiers. While criticizing Michel for meeting human rights activists, the Israeli PM’s office also pointed to another “unfriendly” gesture by Belgium, which had opened an investigation into the alleged war crimes during the Israeli offensive in Gaza in late December 2008 and early January 2009 known as Operation Cast Lead. Last month, the Zionist Union’s Tzipi Livni, who was foreign minister at the time of the operation, canceled a visit to Brussels after the Belgian prosecutor’s office announced it wanted to question her. As an organization established by veteran Israeli combatants in 2004, Breaking the Silence claims to gather first-hand accounts from soldiers depicting widespread human rights violations and bring them to light. The groups states that the “cases of abuse towards Palestinians, looting, and destruction of property,” which have become “the norm for years". "The [Palestinian] civilians know they are not supposed to be there. Therefore, whoever you see there, you kill,” one of the testimonies citing alleged words of an IDF commander reads. B’Tselem, founded in 1989, aims to “educate the Israeli public and policymakers about human rights violations in the Occupied Territories,” and “help create a human rights culture in Israel." The Israeli regime has been apparently trying to silence the groups by erecting legal barriers preventing them from reaching out to the general public. In January, a bill that would forbid nongovernmental organizations that “undermine the educational goals or harm IDF soldiers” from addressing students at schools was passed by the Israeli parliament in a preliminary hearing. The proposed legislation is generally seen by the Israeli media as targeting Breaking the Silence. However, the group itself remained undeterred in its intentions. "[Education Minister Naftali] Bennett’s obsession with Breaking the Silence only makes us stronger. While he tries to silence us, more and more youth hear about the occupation,” Breaking the Silence CEO Yuli Novak said at the time, as cited by the Jerusalem Post.
Cyber attack hits US newspaper distribution  [SEP]  A cyber attack caused major printing and delivery disruptions on Saturday at the Los Angeles Times and other major U.S. newspapers, including ones owned by Tribune Publishing Co such as the Chicago Tribune and Baltimore Sun. The cyber attack appeared to originate outside the United States, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing a source with knowledge of the situation. The attack led to distribution delays in the Saturday edition of The Times, Tribune, Sun and other newspapers that share a production platform in Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Times reported. Tribune Publishing, whose newspapers also include the New York Daily News and Orlando Sentinel, said it first detected the malware on Friday. The West Coast editions of the Wall Street Journal and New York Times were hit as they are also printed on the shared production platform, the Los Angeles Times said. Tribune Publishing spokeswoman Marisa Kollias said the virus hurt back-office systems used to publish and produce "newspapers across our properties." "There is no evidence that customer credit card information or personally identifiable information has been compromised," Kollias said in a statement The Wall Street Journal and New York Times did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Most San Diego Union-Tribune subscribers were without a newspaper on Saturday as the virus infected the company's business systems and hobbled its ability to publish, the paper's editor and publisher Jeff Light wrote on its website. A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security said it was studying the situation. "We are aware of reports of a potential cyber incident affecting several news outlets, and are working with our government and industry partners to better understand the situation," said DHS spokeswoman Katie Waldman in a statement. Representatives of the Federal Bureau of Investigation were not immediately available for comment. Read more: Palo Alto prepares to expand scope of Cyber Range
Trump proposes $100 billion more in new tariffs on China  [SEP]  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Thursday he had instructed U.S. trade officials to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs on China, fueling an already heated trade dispute between the world’s two biggest economies. Trump said in a statement the further tariffs were being considered “in light of China’s unfair retaliation” against earlier U.S. trade actions that included $50 billion of tariffs on Chinese goods. He added that the U.S. Trade Representative had determined that China “has repeatedly engaged in practices to unfairly obtain America’s intellectual property.” U.S. stock index futures fell in reaction to Trump’s latest statement. Financial markets have swung wildly over the past few days in response to fears of escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. “Rather than remedy its misconduct, China has chosen to harm our farmers and manufacturers,” Trump said. The tariffs are aimed at forcing changes to Chinese government policies aimed at transferring U.S. intellectual property to Chinese companies. The USTR’s “Section 301” investigation authorizing the tariffs alleges China has systematically sought to misappropriate U.S. intellectual property through joint venture requirements that often cannot be negotiated without technology transfers, something China denies. The tariffs have stirred fears that the two countries will spiral into a trade war that will crush global growth. The Trump administration this week proposed 25 percent tariffs on some 1,300 Chinese industrial and other products. China shot back with a list of similar duties on American imports including soybeans, planes, cars, beef and chemicals. The retaliatory tariffs have left Republican lawmakers from Western and Midwestern states fearful of a big hit to U.S. farming exporters.
Armenia's Peaceful Revolution Is a Lesson for Putin  [SEP]  It was almost inconceivable after Russia's violent reaction to Ukraine's 2014 "Revolution of Dignity" that tiny Armenia, a largely Moscow-friendly nation, would attempt a revolution of its own. Yet on Monday, Armenian Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan was forced to resign by mass protests that paralyzed the nation. Russia is unlikely to intervene: The protesters have been careful to stress that their motives were strictly domestic. And yet the end of Sargsyan's career should be of interest to another leader who might be tempted to extend his reign past constitutional limits: Russian President Vladimir Putin. For 10 years, Sargsyan had been Armenia's president. A native of Nagorno Karabakh, disputed by Armenia and Azerbaijan, he rose in the 1990s to become the breakaway region's defense minister and eventually to occupy the same position in Armenia. The Karabakh issue, important to many Armenians, carried him to victory in the 2008 presidential election. As president, he played a complex game, letting Russia extend its military presence in Armenia yet also cooperating with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, joining Putin's pet project the Eurasian Economic Union and signing a partnership agreement with the European Union. Unlike the leaders of Georgia and Ukraine, who navigated the divide between Russia and the West in much less nuanced ways, Sargsyan was happy to work with anyone except Azerbaijan. While this stance was geopolitically sound for a small, landlocked country engaged in a festering territorial conflict, Armenia hasn't done well economically under Sargsyan. It has barely recovered after a 14 percent economic output drop in 2009. Strong economic ties to Russia have been one reason for the slow economic performance, not that Armenia had too many other options. In 2017, the Armenian economy posted an impressive growth of 7.5 percent, but that was from a low base after almost zero growth in 2016. Through the end of that year, the Armenian economy was tortured by deflation and an anemic domestic demand. The government has consistently run high budget deficits, and unemployment remains above 16 percent. Armenia is a poor nation, with 11.6 percent of its population living below the official poverty level of $3.20 a day, adjusted for purchasing power parity, and the most active part of its population has long preferred to emigrate. According to 2017 data from the United Nations, almost 900,000 people born in Armenia live outside their home country while only 3 million are still there (the entire Armenian diaspora, which emerged long before the nation became independent, has been estimated at 8 million). Remittances from the emigres constitute some 14 percent of the country's gross domestic product. Immigration provides a release valve for discontent, and widespread poverty has allowed Sargsyan to consolidate power beyond what's normal for democratic countries. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has observed all major Armenian elections, has reported widespread intimidation, pressure and vote-buying during Sargsyan's rule. He also failed to do anything about the country's pervasive corruption. The Armenian constitution only permits two presidential terms, and in 2015, Sargsyan ran a referendum ostensibly shifting the country to a European-style parliamentary republic run by a prime minister who leads the country as long as his or her party wins elections. At the time, Sargsyan claimed he didn't want to become prime minister himself. But in 2017, Sargsyan's Republican Party won a parliamentary election, and he was elected prime minister last week after his presidential term ran out. In response, more than 100,000 Armenians flooded the central square of Yerevan, the nation's capital, in the biggest rally of the past 20 years. Thousands also took to their balconies to bang on empty saucepans, and thousands more marched in provincial towns. In total, some 20 percent of the country's population took part in the protests, led by Nikol Pashinyan, a journalist turned legislator, whose Way Out faction controlled almost 8 percent of the seats in parliament. Young people were the movement's driving force: Faced with a choice between emigrating and trying to change things at home, students have, for the first time in decades, chosen the latter option. On Sunday, Sargsyan met with Pashninyan, hoping to negotiate an end to what the opposition leader described as a "velvet revolution." Pashinyan merely demanded his resignation, so Sargsyan left in a huff after just three minutes. On Monday, as unarmed but uniformed members of the military joined the crowd in the central square, police gave up trying to control the crowd and detain rabble-rousers. Sargsyan gave up, too. "Nikol Pashinyan was right," he said in his resignation statement. "I was mistaken. There are a number of solutions in the current situation, but I will not resort to any of them. That is not my work style. I am giving up the post of the country’s prime minister." The stern Karabakh warrior surrendered to an unarmed, pointedly non-violent crowd. Mass jubilation followed, and, unlike in Ukraine, it's unlikely to be marred by a forceful Russian response. Asked on April 19 for a reaction to the Armenian protests, Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry, merely expressed a conviction that "the situation in friendly Armenia will be resolved democratically and lawfully." Pashinyan interpreted that as a decision not to support Sargsyan, and he was probably right. Given Sargsyan's decision to resign, there's no reason to speak of a coup, as official Moscow did after the Ukrainian revolution. There's also no trace of Western interference; the protesters haven't received public support from any foreign leaders. While Pashinyan has complained about Armenia's obedience to Moscow, he won't be one to dismantle the relationship, if only because Armenia is too small to put up the kind of resistance Ukraine has and mindful of how quickly neighboring Georgia was overrun by Russian troops in 2008. Without a single reason to interfere with Armenians' choice, Putin need to think hard about the finale of his own presidential career. According to the Russian constitution, that is scheduled for 2024. He could try switching to the prime minister's office, as he did in 2008 when Dmitri Medvedev took over as placeholder president, and he could push through constitutional changes that would make the prime minister's office the most powerful in the land. But what if Russians are as fed up by his rule in six years as Armenians were with Sargsyan's? And what if they follow Armenians' example and protest non-violently but stubbornly and in large numbers? That sounds almost impossible today, but six years is a long time, and, given Russia's lack of economic direction and deep-seated corruption, it can't be ruled out.
Three killed in bombing at Bogota mall, nine injured  [SEP]  BOGOTA, Colombia — A bomb rocked one of the busiest shopping centers in Colombia's capital Saturday, killing three people, including a 23-year-old French woman, and injuring nine others. Witnesses told of being evacuated from movie theaters and stores after the blast in a second-floor women's restroom at the upscale Centro Andino in the heart of Bogota's tourist district. Ambulances and firetrucks rushed to the scene and the injured were taken to a hospital, where two later died. Police said a bomb from an undetermined explosive had caused the destruction. Mayor Enrique Penalosa called it a "cowardly terrorist bombing," and attention immediately focused on the National Liberation Army, which is the last rebel movement still active in Colombia. The group, known as the ELN, carried out a spate of recent attacks in Bogota, but leaders denied involvement in the latest bombing. Penalosa said the French victim, identified as Julie Huynh, had been in Colombia the past six months volunteering at a school in a poor neighborhood. He said she was preparing to return to France in the coming days in the company of her mother, who was with her in Bogota. The ELN, which is engaged in long-running peace talks with the government, rejected accusations it was behind the attack. "We ask for seriousness from people making unfounded and reckless accusations," ELN negotiators at peace talks taking place in neighboring Ecuador said on Twitter. "This is the way people are trying to tear up the peace process." The ELN in February claimed responsibility for a bombing near Bogota's bullring that killed one police officer and injured 20 other people. But the group said it doesn't target civilians. Penalosa urged residents of Bogota's wealthier districts to be on high alert but cautioned that there was no hint of other attacks being planned. Police said they were still trying to determine what the device that exploded was made of. The government last year reached a peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, which was much bigger than the ELN. Some analysts attribute an uptick in violence in Colombian cities to the ELN's desire to wrest concessions from the government at the negotiating table. Bogota has seen dramatic improvement in security over the past decade as the country's long-running conflict has wound down. But the capital remains vulnerable to attacks as residents have let down their guard Still, the Andino shopping center would seem a difficult target. All vehicles entering the parking garage are screened by bomb-sniffing dogs and security guards are present throughout the mall. President Juan Manuel Santos was expected to visit the mall to personally oversee the investigation and in a message posted on Twitter he expressed his solidarity with the victims.
Congress, JD-S should have allied in Karnataka: Mamata  [SEP]  Kolkata, May 15 (IANS) West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday congratulated “the winning party” in Karnataka and said had the Congress formed an alliance with the Janata Dal-Secular (JD-S), the election result would have been “very different”. “Congratulations to the winners of the Karnataka elections. For those who lost, fight back. If Congress had gone into an alliance with the JD-S, the result would have been different. Very different,” Banerjee tweeted. According to latest trends, Karnataka delivered a hung assembly with none of the parties able to reach the halfway mark in the 224-member Assembly, where two constituencies didn’t vote on Saturday. After the initial euphoria in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) camp, Election Commission data showed the BJP could end up with 104 seats while Congress and JD-S would manage 78 and 38 seats respectively. However, in a dramatic turn of events, the Congress announced its backing to the JD-S to form a government and prevent the BJP from regaining power in its only southern bastion.
Malaysia's Mahathir plans lean cabinet, seeks Anwar's pardon  [SEP]  Malaysia's new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Friday he will form a lean cabinet with 10 core ministries and start the process of obtaining an immediate pardon for jailed opposition icon Anwar Ibrahim. Mahathir was sworn in as Malaysia's seventh premier late Thursday, a day after leading his four-party opposition alliance to a stunning election victory that ousted scandal-plagued Prime Minister Najib Razak and ended his coalition's 60-year unbroken grip on power. It was a remarkable comeback for Mahathir, who was premier for 22 years until his retirement in 2003 and is now the world's oldest leader at 92. Mahathir said the king has indicated he was willing to give an immediate pardon that would free Anwar, who was jailed in 2015 on sodomy charges he said were fabricated by the then-government to crush the opposition. "We will go through the proper process of obtaining a pardon for Anwar... it is going to be a full pardon, which of course, means he is not only pardoned but to be released immediately," he told a news conference. He didn't say how long the process will take and whether Anwar could be freed before his sentence ends June 8. It was a second spell in prison for Anwar, a former deputy prime minister in the defeated ruling party who was also imprisoned under Mahathir in 1998 following a power struggle. Anwar and Mahathir joined forces in an unlikely alliance that helped the opposition nailed the electoral victory. Mahathir's deputy in the new government is Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, Anwar's wife and the leader of his People's Justice Party. She is the first female deputy premier in Malaysia but the current set-up is seen as transitional as Mahathir has agreed to hand over the baton to Anwar once he is freed. Mahathir has been coy about how long he will stay in his new job. Anwar will need to contest and win a by-election after he is freed to become a member of parliament before he takes on the top job. Mahathir said his four-party alliance will hold a meeting Saturday and name 10 ministers for a start. He said he doesn't want a "huge" cabinet, in a veiled reference to past cabinets with more than 30 ministers. He also issued a strong warning against graft, with corrupt officials to be replaced in an overhaul of government departments. He indicated this could include Attorney General Mohamed Apandi Ali, who was appointed after Najib sacked the then-attorney general in 2015 to escape possible prosecution over a corruption scandal involving the 1MDB state fund. "The attorney-general has undermined his own credibility. He has, in fact, hidden evidence of wrongdoing and that is wrong in law," Mahathir said. Anger over the 1MDB scandal prompted Mahathir to emerge from retirement and sparked the anger that helped to oust Najib's coalition. The fund was set up by Najib in 2009 to promote economic development but it accumulated billions in debts and is under investigations in the U.S. and other countries. U.S. investigators say Najib's associates stole and looted at least $4.5 billion from the fund, of which some $700 million landed in Najib's bank account. Najib denied any wrongdoing and Mohamed Apandi cleared Najib in 2016, saying the money was a donation from Saudi Arabia's royal family and most of it returned. Mahathir has said he would not go on a witch hunt but that Najib will be brought to court if there was evidence of wrongdoing.
Philippine official downplays alleged China war threats  [SEP]  MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippines’ top diplomat sought Monday to downplay President Rodrigo Duterte’s pronouncement that Chinese President Xi Jinping told him China would go to war with Manila if it insists on drilling for oil in the disputed South China Sea, saying they were not threatening each other but talking about preventing conflict. Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano told reporters there was no bullying and the context of frank talks last week in China — the details of which he said he could not discuss —”was on how to avoid conflict” and “how to increase trust and mutual respect.” “There was no language or even tone that would lead any of the two presidents to believe that there was disrespect for them or their country,” he said. Cayetano said Duterte apparently talked about his meeting with Xi just to respond to a barrage of criticisms that he has been soft on China and has refused to raise the Philippines’ arbitral victory last year that invalidates most of China’s claims in the South China Sea. He said that after his return next week from a trip to Russia with Duterte he will explain the context of the two leaders’ exchange to lawmakers and a Supreme Court justice, who have urged the Philippines to file a diplomatic protest over the alleged war threats and to ask the United Nations to demand that China comply with the arbitral ruling. “My interpretation in the meeting is that there was no bullying or pushing around or it wasn’t a threat,” Cayetano said. He said Duterte is committed to “protect every single inch of our territory” and Filipinos should trust him on how he will do it. Duterte said in a speech late Friday at a coast guard event in southern Davao city that he raised the Philippines’ arbitral victory against Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea and told Xi Manila intends to drill for oil there. “I said when we were face-to-face, ‘That is ours and we intend to drill oil there.’ No beating around the bush,” Duterte said. He said the reply was: “Well, we are friends. We do not want to quarrel with you. We would want to maintain the present warm relationship. But if you force the issue, we will go to war.” “Please do not do that because that is ours,” Duterte further quoted Xi as saying. He said he replied, “But I have the arbitral (award).” Xi then reportedly said: “Yes, but ours is historical and yours is legal of recent memory. We had that since the Ming dynasty.” Duterte said he replied that “that’s too far away” and it is “almost alien to us to hear those words because we were never under Chinese jurisdiction.” Xi reportedly responded: “Well, if you force the issue, we’ll be forced to tell you the truth.” And when Duterte asked what that was, Xi reportedly said: “We will go to war. We will fight you.” Duterte’s spokesman, Enesto Abella, said Monday that Duterte’s first and last priority is national interest and the well-being of Filipinos, and that China and the Philippines are committed to peaceful resolutions of their disputes. “We are very clear that we are not giving up our claim of sovereignty and sovereign rights over certain islands in the South China Sea. At the same time, these matters are pursued in the context of maintaining peace and prosperity in the region,” Abella said.
10 Guantanamo Prisoners Freed In Oman; 45 Detainees Remain  [SEP]  The U.S. has released 10 prisoners from Guantanamo Bay to the Arab nation of Oman, reducing the detainee population to 45 in the waning days of the Obama administration. The freed prisoners were not identified by name or nationality, though the Oman News Agency, citing the country's Foreign Ministry, reported that the 10 had arrived in the country on Monday for "temporary residence." Prior to Monday's announcement, Oman had taken in 20 Guantanamo detainees over the past two years, and all of them were from Oman's neighbor, Yemen. At its peak, Guantanamo had close to 700 prisoners. When President Obama entered office in January 2009, he immediately pledged to close the prison in Cuba, which was down to 242 detainees at the time. Many have been released to their home countries or to other nations over the past eight years. However, most of those still in Guantanamo are considered by U.S. authorities to be too dangerous to be released, and Congress has barred them from being brought to the United States. President-elect Donald Trump recently called on the Obama administration to stop releasing Guantanamo prisoners. On Jan 3, Trump tweeted: "There should be no further releases from Gitmo. These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield." Trump said during the presidential campaign he would like to see additional terror suspects sent to the prison. "We're gonna load it up with some bad dudes, believe me, we're gonna load it up," Trump said last February.
US helicopter crash in Iraq kills seven military personnel  [SEP]  US helicopter crash in Iraq kills seven military personnel Seven US military personnel have been killed in a helicopter crash in Iraq. The aircraft crashed in western Iraq late on Thursday night, according to US officials. The crash did not appear to be the result of enemy activity and is under investigation, the Pentagon said in a written statement. "This tragedy reminds us of the risks our men and women face every day in service of our nations," US Army Brigadier General Jonathan P Braga, director of operations in the fight against IS in Iraq and Syria, said. "We are thinking of the loved ones of these service members today." The helicopter, which was used by the Air Force for combat search and rescue, crashed near the town of Qaim in Anbar Province. The Pentagon said an accompanying US helicopter immediately reported the crash and a quick-reaction force comprised of Iraqi security forces and coalition members secured the scene. The names of those killed — everyone on board — will be released after next of kin have been notified, the statement added. The US-led coalition battling Islamic State (IS) in Iraq and Syria have an outpost in Qaim, which is located near the Syrian border. The anti-IS campaign accelerated through much of last year, as coalition and Iraqi forces battled to take back a string of cities and towns. The US-led coalition has continued to work with Iraq and Syrian Democratic Forces to shore up the border region to make sure that foreign fighters and insurgents cannot move freely across the region.
'Strong evidence' N Korea behind NHS cyberattack  [SEP]  There is "strong" evidence to suggest a North Korea-linked group was behind last week's global cyberattack, security experts say. Simon Choi, director of South Korean anti-virus firm Hauri, said the code used in the attack shared many similarities with previous hacks attributed to North Korea-linked Lazarus Group. The same collective is believed to have been behind the 2014 hack of Sony Pictures and is also suspected of previous attacks on the global financial system. Mr Choi said: "I saw signs last year that the North was preparing ransomware attacks or even already beginning to do so, targeting some South Korean companies." He added that since 2013, hackers aligned to Pyongyang have been using malicious software to extort Bitcoin - the online currency demanded in last week's WannaCry cyberattack. Israeli-based security firm Intezer Labs said there were "clear code connections" between Lazarus and WannaCry, adding that the evidence "strongly suggests that these hacking tools were written or modified by the same author". Symantec and Kaspersky are investigating whether hackers from Lazarus Group were responsible for infecting an estimated 300,000 machines in 150 countries. Their enquiries came as the White House said that paying ransom money to unlock files encrypted by the global cyberattack does not work. Homeland security adviser Tom Bossett told reporters he is not aware of a case where transferring $300 (£232) in Bitcoin - the amount demanded from victims of last week's attack - has "led to any data recovery". President Trump's administration estimates that less than $70,000 (£54,285) has been paid to the criminals behind the ransomware so far. During a White House briefing, Mr Bossert said no federal systems in the US had been affected by the malicious software. He added that his British counterparts said they now had a "feeling of control" after the attack struck 47 NHS organisations. Russia has denied it had anything to do with what Europol called the "largest ransomware attack observed in history", and President Vladimir Putin described it as payback for the US intelligence services. His remarks came after Microsoft's chief legal officer said the US National Security Agency had developed the original code used in the attack, which was later leaked in a document dump. Mr Putin said: "A genie let out of a bottle of this kind, especially created by secret services, can then cause damage to its authors and creators." Meanwhile, the 22-year old computer expert who discovered the WannaCry's hidden kill switch says he does not think of himself as a hero and was just "doing my bit to stop botnets". British-born Marcus Hutchins, who is currently working in Los Angeles, stumbled on the solution by accident while analysing a sample of the malicious code, and then spent three days fighting the ransomware worm. Mr Hutchins' manager at online security firm Kryptos Logic said he "not only saved the United States but also prevented further damage to the rest of the world". Sky News has learned that health trusts in England were sent details of a security patch last month that would have allowed them to protect themselves. A spokesman for NHS Digital said: "Our understanding is that if that had been acted on it would have prevented (the malware attack)."
Hurricane Florence deluges Carolinas ahead of landfall  [SEP]  Flooding from Hurricane Florence swept across the Carolinas early on Friday as the massive storm surged towards the coast, threatening record rainfall and leaving scores trapped by rising waters and thousands without power. Florence, set to make landfall on Friday, was expected to cover almost all of North Carolina in several feet of water, State Governor Roy Cooper told reporters. The National Weather Service said as much as seven inches of rain had fallen overnight in some coastal areas. With the brunt of the slow-moving storm yet to come, about 150 people were awaiting rescue in New Bern, a city near the coast, where a gauge on the Neuse River recorded 10 feet (three meters) of inundation, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.
Trump signs bill imposing sanctions on Russia  [SEP]  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed a bill imposing new sanctions on Russia, conceding under pressure from his own party that a warmer relationship with Moscow was not in the country’s best interest. The legislation is aimed at punishing Moscow for interfering in the 2016 presidential election and for its military aggression in Ukraine and Syria, where the Kremlin has backed President Bashar Assad. It also imposes financial sanctions against Iran and North Korea. Moscow responded to a White House announcement last week that Trump intended to sign the bill, ordering a reduction in the number of U.S. diplomats in Russia. The House overwhelmingly backed the bill, 419-3, and the Senate rapidly following their lead on a 98-2 vote. Those overwhelming margins guaranteed that Congress would be able to beat back any attempt by Trump to reject the measure. Provisions backed by Republican and Democrats would handcuff Trump on the Russia sanctions resulted from lawmakers’ worries that he may ease the financial hits without first securing concessions from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Republicans refused to budge even after the White House complained that the “congressional review” infringed on Trump’s executive authority. Faced with the embarrassing possibility of being overruled by Trump’s own party, the White House announced late Friday that he “approves the bill and intends to sign it.” The proposed measures target Russia’s energy sector as part of legislation that prevents Trump from easing sanctions on Moscow without congressional approval. Two White House officials said that the president signed the bill Wednesday morning. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly before the official statement.
Iran-backed Houthi rebels attack Saudi warship in Red Sea  [SEP]  Iran-backed Houthi rebels attacked a Saudi warship in the Red Sea Monday, killing two sailors and wounding three others, a U.S. official confirmed to Fox News. The Saudi frigate, Al Madinah, was conducting routine operations in the southern Red Sea when the attack occurred. THREE SERVICE MEMBERS HURT IN OSPREY CRASH AFTER DEADLY YEMEN TERROR RAID It is unknown if the ship was hit by a missile or by suicide attack after being rammed by a small boat, officials told Fox News. The U.S. military was monitoring the situation. The Saudi frigate was able to continue her transit despite the damage, according to the official. ISLAMIC BODY CALLS TRAVEL BAN A 'GRAVE CONCERN' The attack came one day after President Trump spoke to Saudi Arabia’s King Salman. Iran launched a ballistic missile Sunday in defiance of a U.N. resolution that ordered the Islamic Republic to stop such tests, U.S. officials revealed to Fox News. In October, U.S. Navy warships came under missile attack by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the same area of the southern Red Sea just north of the Bab al Mandab Strait. For the first time in history, a U.S. destroyer successfully shot down incoming enemy missiles using SM-2 missiles in the October attack. Days later Tomahawk cruise missile launched from the USS Nitze destroyed the Houthi radar installations responsible for firing on the U.S. warships.
Caspian Sea countries finalize details of convention for its legal status  [SEP]  The foreign ministers of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Iran, Russia and Turkmenistan met on Saturday in Aktau to finalize the details of the Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea that the leaders of the five countries are planning to sign at an upcoming summit. "We are confident that tomorrow a historic step will be taken, it will be a very important moment for all of us," Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev said at the opening ceremony of the Kuryk multimodal port, a key infrastructure for the development of transport across the Caspian Sea for the New Silk Road.
No. 3 Justice Department official stepping down amid turmoil  [SEP]  WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department's No. 3 official is planning to step down at a time of turmoil in the agency. Rachel Brand is leaving for the top legal job at Walmart, friend and former colleague Jamie Gorelick told The Associated Press Friday. Brand attracted interest because of her potential to assume a key role in the Trump-Russia investigation. The official overseeing special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, has been repeatedly criticized by Trump. If Rosenstein had been fired or quit, oversight would have fallen to Brand. That job would now fall to Solicitor General Noel Francisco. "She felt this was an opportunity she couldn't turn down," Gorelick said. Walmart sought Brand to be head of global corporate governance at the retail giant, a position Gorelick said has legal and policy responsibilities that will cater to her strengths. "It really seems to have her name on it," Gorelick said. President and CEO Doug McMillon said Walmart "is fortunate to have a leader of Rachel Brand's stature join the company." The New York Times first reported the departure, which comes as the Justice Department has been subject to unprecedented attack by President Donald Trump. His broadsides have strained morale at the institution known for its vaunted independence from the White House. And her departure leaves another vacancy at the Justice Department, which still lacks Senate-confirmed leaders over many of its most important divisions. Trump, who has openly lamented his inability to influence Justice Department decisions, has stepped up his criticism in recent weeks, fueled by the release of a politically explosive memo alleging the FBI abused its surveillance powers in the Russia investigation. Brand, who became associate attorney general in May, has kept a relatively low profile and, unlike other top officials, has not been personally targeted by Trump. Attorney General Jeff Sessions praised the "quality and leadership" of Brand and Rosenstein at a Justice Department event last week that focused on human trafficking, which was one of her stated priorities. In a statement, Brand said she is proud of the department's accomplishments during her short time there. "The men and women of the Department of Justice impress me every day," she said. Brand was also a high-ranking official in the department under George W. Bush. In her current capacity, she oversaw a number of politically challenging areas of the department, including the civil rights, antitrust and civil divisions. "Rachel has shown real leadership over many important divisions at the department," Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement Friday night in which he congratulated Brand. "She will always remain part of the Department of Justice family." She had recently pushed Congress to renew a foreign intelligence surveillance program that gives the U.S. government authority to spy on foreigners located outside the country. And she had been vocal about the department's efforts to support students who say their free speech rights are being violated on college campuses. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

At least 10 people killed in Egyptian train crash  [SEP]  CAIRO, Feb 28 (Reuters) - At least 10 people were killed and 15 others were injured in a train crash on Wednesday in Egypt’s northern province of Beheira, the health ministry said. Two passenger carriages separated from one train and collided with a cargo train, the official news agency MENA said, citing the provincial security director. Egyptians have long complained that successive governments have failed to enforce basic safety measures for the railways. A string of crashes have further inflamed public anger over the antiquated transport network. A collision in August killed 42 people and injured more than 100 people.
Brazil General Strike, Demonstrations Disrupt Transportation  [SEP]  SÃO PAULO -- A general strike in Brazil, called to protest proposed labor and pension changes, practically shut down mass transit in São Paulo, the country's biggest city, and disrupted transportation across Brazil Friday. In São Paulo, the country's financial capital and industrial hub, many bus, metro and train lines weren't operating Friday morning, and major roads and arteries were blocked by protesters, according to city authorities. In Brasília, the capital, access to the city's international airport was also blocked by protesters, TV images showed. Local news media reported that some flights have been canceled because of the strike, though the country's airport regulator declined to attribute the cancellations to the labor action. The strike was called by some of Brazil's largest unions. Many businesses, banks and schools closed, and the Força Sindical union said some factories have also shut down. Protesters are trying to stop the government of President Michel Temer from cutting back the country's generous pension system and from reducing some worker protections. Mr. Temer says both changes are needed to reignite the country's economy. Over the past two years, Brazil has suffered through its worst economic recession on record, which has slashed tax revenue and made the proposed changes even more urgent, some economists say. The pension proposal, which is currently still in a committee in the lower house of Congress, would close loopholes that for decades have allowed Brazilians to retire in their mid-50s with pensions as high as their latest salary. That situation has led to social-security costs eating up about half of the nation's budget. Mr. Temer already faces resistance in Congress to the unpopular pension overhaul, and Friday's strike could make its passage even more difficult while forcing the administration to scale back an already watered-down proposal, according to Luciano Rostagno, Latin America strategist at Banco Mizuho, in São Paulo. "The government might have to make even more concessions" to get it passed, he said. Some version of the plan is likely to be approved, but a weakened proposal might mean Brazil's next government will be forced to make further changes, Mr. Rostagno added. The labor law proposal, which on Wednesday was approved in the lower house of Brazil's Congress and will now move on to the Senate, would overhaul some of the country's 1940s-era labor code as policy makers seek to kindle an economic recovery. Included in the bill are proposals designed to reduce or scrap mandatory union dues, make it harder for workers to sue their employers, and expand the scope for flexible work arrangements and temporary employment contracts.

Driver Rams Crowd At A Melbourne Mall, Killing At Least 4 People  [SEP]  At least four people were killed and 20 more injured when a man deliberately drove his car into a crowd of pedestrians at a mall in Melbourne, Australia, according to officials. In a statement released Friday, Victoria state police said a young child was among the dead. "The incident is not terrorism related," the department added. The man was seen driving erratically in circles outside the mall, leaning out his widow and shouting at passersby, before police say he accelerated into the pedestrians in the middle of the afternoon. "We witnessed about half a dozen people that ricocheted off the car one way or another," one witness tells Reuters. "I saw one person fly up almost roof level of the car as they got thrown up against one of the retail stores." Officers shot the driver and placed him in custody, "where he is being treated for non-life threatening injuries," police say. Mike O'Brien, the head surgeon at Royal Children's Hospital, tells The New York Times that four children have been hospitalized, including a 3-month-old in critical condition. At a news conference, Victoria Police Commissioner Graham Ashton said the 26-year-old suspect had "an extensive family violence history. He has come to our attention on many occasions in the past. We have mental health and drug-related issues in the background of this particular person," according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Authorities have not yet released his name. Police say they had been pursuing the suspect in connection with a stabbing early Friday. According to authorities, the man also allegedly abducted a woman he knows and held her hostage in his car — though she managed to escape before it plowed into the crowd. The incident comes at a particularly busy time for the city. It is hosting tourists from around the world for the Australian Open tennis tournament, which got underway earlier this month.
Did Trump know of Russian hacking? Yes, says White House - Rediff.com India News  [SEP]  There are indications that Donald Trump, the president-elect, knew about Russian involvement in hacking of the servers of the rival Clinton Campaign and the Democratic party, the White House has said. “There’s ample evidence that was known long before the election and, in most cases, long before October about the Trump campaign and Russia -- everything from the Republican nominee himself calling on Russia to hack his opponent,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. “It might be an indication that he was obviously aware and concluded, based on whatever facts or sources he had available to him, that Russia was involved, and their involvement was having a negative impact on his opponent’s campaign. That’s why he was encouraging them to keep doing it,” Earnest said in response to a question. A secret assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that Russia intervened in the presidential elections to help Trump, The Washington Post had reported, citing officials briefed on the matter. “You had the Republican nominee refer to the President of Russia as a strong leader. The Republican nominee chose a campaign chair that had extensive, lucrative, personal financial ties to the Kremlin,” Earnest said. He said this was obvious to those who were covering the race that the hack-and-leak strategy that had been operationalised was not being equally applied to the two parties and to the two campaigns. There was one side that was bearing the brunt of that strategy and another side that was clearly benefiting from it, he observed. “Now, I know there’s a lot of reporting that there may be some disagreement in the intelligence community about whether or not that was the intent. That’s a question that they should ask and a question that they may attempt to answer, but there certainly was no doubt about the effect. “And, again, it didn’t require a security clearance or a consensus, high-confidence intelligence assessment to understand. In spite of all that, that didn’t change the way in which this information was reported on, either,” he said. Outgoing US President Barack Obama, who had endorsed a candidate in the presidential race, believed it was important for the intelligence community to make this announcement. “That’s why you saw a joint statement from the Intelligence community and from the Department of Homeland Security. That was an effort to ensure that this information avoided even the appearance of being politically motivated,” Earnest said. “The president had very strong feelings about the race and about the candidates who are involved in the race. And the president in the last four or five weeks of the campaign saw that the president didn’t pull any punches in forcefully making an argument in support of his preferred candidate. And he believed that that political activity should be separate from the intelligence community’s analysis of Russian malicious cyber activity,” he said.
OPEC begins debate on oil cuts amid deep disagreement  [SEP]  Ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries started an informal meeting at 0700 GMT at the Vienna Park Hyatt hotel and were due to begin a formal gathering at OPEC headquarters at 0900 GMT. "There will be an agreement today," an Iraqi delegate said as he entered the hotel. "I'm optimistic," said Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh, adding there had been no request for Iran to cut output. On Tuesday, Iran wrote to OPEC saying it wanted Saudi Arabia to cut production by as much as 1 million barrels per day (bpd), much more than Riyadh is willing to offer, OPEC sources who saw the letter told Reuters. The 14-country group, which accounts for a third of global oil production, made a preliminary agreement in Algiers in September to cap output at around 32.5-33 million bpd versus the current 33.64 million bpd to prop up oil prices, which have halved since mid-2014. OPEC said it would exempt Iran, Libya and Nigeria from cuts as their output has been crimped by unrest and sanctions. The deal was seen as a victory for Iran. Tehran has long argued it wants to raise production to regain market share lost under Western sanctions, when its political arch-rival Saudi Arabia increased output. In recent weeks, Riyadh changed its stance and offered to cut its output by 0.5 million bpd, according to OPEC sources, while suggesting Iran limit production at around 3.8 million bpd - in line with or slightly above the country's current output. Tehran has sent mixed signals, saying it wanted to produce as much as 4.2 million bpd. Iran's letter to OPEC suggested Saudi Arabia should cut output to 9.5 million bpd. Iraq has also been pressing for higher output limits, saying it needs more money to fight the militant group Islamic State. Iran and Iraq together produce over 8 million bpd, only slightly behind long-time leader Saudi with 10.5 million bpd. The argument between Iraq and Saudi Arabia mainly focuses on whether Baghdad should use its own output estimates to limit production or rely on lower figures from OPEC's experts. Brent crude LCOc1 rose 1.5 percent on Wednesday to more than $47 a barrel after heavy losses a day earlier. [O/R] Some analysts including Morgan Stanley and Macquarie have said oil prices will correct sharply if OPEC fails to reach a deal, potentially going as low as $35 per barrel.
Fire sweeps through market in Kenya's capital, killing 15  [SEP]  NAIROBI, Kenya - Kenyan media report that a fire has swept through a marketplace in Nairobi, killing 15 and sending 70 injured to hospitals. Rescue teams are searching for more bodies and survivors in the market in Gitomba, a neighbourhood in the capital city.
1 dead, 10 injured after van hit worshippers in London  [SEP]  A vehicle struck pedestrians outside a mosque in north London early Monday morning, killing at least one person and injuring 10 others, police said.One person has been arrested but police have not said if the crash was deliberate or accidental.The London Ambulance Service says the injured are being taken to hospitals. Eyewitnesses reported seeing police give emergency medical treatment to at least one of the injured.The Muslim Council tweeted that worshippers were struck by a van as they were leaving prayers near the Finsbury Park mosque. It said its prayers are with the victims.London police have declared the crash a major incident and closed the area to normal traffic. A helicopter circled above the area as a large cordon was established to keep motorists and pedestrians away.Eyewitness told Sky News and other British media that the van seemed to have veered and hit people intentionally. Police did not confirm that.Mohammed Shafiq of the Ramadhan Foundation, a Muslim organization, said that based on eyewitness reports it seems to be a "deliberate attack against innocent Muslims."The neighborhood has two mosques, and several hundred worshippers would have been in the area after attending prayers as part of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.The Finsbury Park mosque was associated with extremist ideology for several years after the 9/11 attacks in the United States but was shut down and reorganized. It has not been associated with radical views for more than a decade.Prime Minister Theresa May described the crash as a "terrible incident." The statement from her office said her thoughts were with the injured, their loved ones and emergency services who responded to the scene.Metropolitan Police said officers were called to the scene on Seven Sisters Road at 12:20 a.m. Monday.Police have not offered any details about the cause of the crash.Britain's terrorist alert has been set at "severe" meaning an attack is highly likely.Earlier this month, a van veered into pedestrians on London Bridge, setting off vehicle and knife attacks that killed eight people and wounded many others on the bridge and in the nearby Borough Market area. Three Muslim extremists who carried out the attack were killed by police.Manchester was also hit by a severe attack when a bomber killed more than 20 people at an Ariana Grande concert.
The T. Rex Was A Carnivore In The Streets, But Sensitive In The Sheets  [SEP]  We mostly know the Tyrannosaurus Rex as the king of the dinosaurs, a giant meat-eater movie star who crushes fences and eats lawyers. But it turns out that the T. Rex may have had some evolutionary advantages in the lovemaking department that helped it. No, we’re not talking about its scaly tallywhacker, although depending on who you ask that thing was roughly the length of a Buick. No, instead paleontologists have discovered a relative of T. Rex, Daspletosaurus horneri, and have found, studying the snout, that it might have been an exceptionally sensitive “third hand,” much like the sensory organs found in crocodiles. That allowed them to find better nesting places, better explore their surroundings, handle their eggs and young with more sensitivity, and — most importantly, for our purposes — do hot dino foreplay by rubbing snouts. Admittedly, while dino-banging is completely hilarious to imagine, this is a pretty big deal. Being good in bed is a vital reproductive tactic that allows species to survive and thrive: After all, if species enjoy makin’ babies, they’re going to do it more. So this might, in some small way, help explain why the Tyrannosaur was at the top of the food chain. Well, that and the Buick-sized wang. That probably helped.
Army helicopter with 3 aboard goes down in Maryland  [SEP]  Army helicopter with 3 aboard goes down in Maryland LEONARDTOWN - A northern Virginia Army base says one of its helicopters with three crew members on board went down in southern Maryland, and one crew member was evacuated from the scene. Fort Belvoir said in a post on its Facebook page that the UH-60 helicopter made a "hard landing" around 1:50 p.m. Monday near Leonardtown, Maryland. There was no immediate word on the condition of the crew member who was medically evacuated or the other two who were aboard. Fort Belvoir referred further questions to the U.S. Army's Military District of Washington. The public affairs office said it was working on a statement. Fort Belvoir is located near the Potomac River south of Washington
In last minute twist, FBI clears Clinton on emails  [SEP]  CLEVELAND (AP) — In an extraordinary last-minute twist to a volatile campaign, FBI director James Comey lifted the cloud he had placed over Hillary Clinton, saying Sunday the bureau had found no evidence in its hurried review of newly discovered emails to warrant criminal charges against her. Comey’s move capped a stunning chapter in the bitter, deeply divisive contest between Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. The director’s initial decision to make a renewed inquiry into Clinton’s emails public on Oct. 28 upended the campaign at a crucial moment, sapping a surging Clinton’s momentum and giving Trump fresh ammunition to challenge her trustworthiness. Clinton’s campaign, furious at Comey’s handling of the review, welcomed Sunday’s announcement. Communications director Jennifer Palmieri told reporters, “We’re glad this matter is resolved,” though Clinton herself did not mention the issue during a rally in Ohio with basketball superstar LeBron James. The new review involved material found on a computer belonging to Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former congressman and estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. While Comey was vague in his initial description of the inquiry, he said Sunday that the FBI reviewed communications “to or from Hillary Clinton while she was secretary of state.” Based on that review, Comey told lawmakers the FBI was not changing the conclusion it reached this summer. Then, Comey said, “no reasonable prosecutor” would recommend Clinton face criminal charges for using a private email system while at the State Department. Trump, campaigning in Michigan, challenged the FBI’s ability to review the newly discovered emails so quickly and argued Clinton was being protected by a “rigged system.” “Hillary Clinton is guilty. She knows it, the FBI knows it, the people know it,” Trump declared. “Now it’s up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on Nov. 8.” In financial trading Sunday evening, Dow Jones index futures jumped about 200 points ahead of Monday’s stock market opening on news of Comey’s announcement. The stock market, which is allergic to uncertainty close to Election Day, wilted after Comey’s notification to Congress in late October. The FBI began investigating the handling of classified material on Clinton’s private email server shortly after she announced her bid in April 2015. The issue has dogged Clinton’s campaign and contributed to the questions a majority of Americans have about her honesty and trustworthiness. Still, Clinton had appeared to be heading for a sweeping victory before Comey’s first letter to lawmakers, in which he stressed the FBI could not yet assess “whether or not this material may be significant,” or how long it might take to run down the new investigative leads. Since then, national polls and those in battleground states indicated a tightening race for the White House and for several competitive Senate seats. Democrats need to pick up four seats if Clinton wins to take back control of the chamber. “The October surprise that came only 11 days before Election Day has unfairly hurt the campaign of one candidate and changed the tenor of this election,” Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said in a statement. Clinton still appears to hold an edge over Trump in the campaign’s final stretch. The Republican has a narrow path to victory that requires him to win nearly all of the roughly dozen battleground states up for grabs. The candidates spent Sunday sprinting across swing states as they sought to lock up support ahead of Election Day. As the campaign’s final weekend drew to a close, more than 41 million Americans had already cast their ballots in early voting. During remarks at a black church in Philadelphia on Sunday morning, Clinton urged voters to choose “unity over division” as she sought to close a caustic presidential campaign on an uplifting note. She warned that President Barack Obama’s legacy is on the line, part of her strategy to shore up black voters who may be less enthusiastic about her than the president. “If we come together with the common vision, common faith, we will find common ground,” Clinton declared. Following her rally in Ohio, Clinton headed to New Hampshire with Khizr Khan, the Gold Star father who delivered a stinging indictment of Trump at the Democratic convention. Her high-wattage allies also fanned out across the country, including President Barack Obama, who was joined by musical icon Stevie Wonder at a rally in Florida. Trump opened a furious day of campaigning in Iowa, the battleground state where he appears strongest. He was also making stops in Minnesota, Michigan and Pennsylvania, three states that have reliably voted for Democrats in presidential elections, as well as Virginia, a state Clinton’s campaign believes it has a solid hold on. Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told reporters Sunday that Trump planned to keep up the breakneck campaign pace through Election Day. After voting in New York Tuesday morning, Trump was expected to return to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina and New Hampshire later in the day, Conway said. The businessman was also facing criticism for a new ad that asserts the “establishment has trillions of dollars at stake in this election” and features photos of billionaire George Soros, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, all of whom are Jewish. The National Jewish Democratic Council said the ad’s use of anti-Semitic stereotypes is “shocking and dangerous.” Trump’s campaign pushed back, saying the criticism of the ad was “completely false and uncalled for.” Associated Press writers Jonathan Lemire, Kathleen Hennessey and Marcy Gordon in Washington contributed to this report.
Portland Might Fire Terry Stotts After Another Early Playoff Exit  [SEP]  The Portland Trail Blazers were the first team eliminated from the NBA playoffs on Saturday, getting swept by Anthony Davis and the New Orleans Pelicans in a stunning Game 4 triumph in NOLA. It might also be the last time Terry Stotts is on the bench for the Blazers. The Blazers had another impressive regular season, hitting 49 wins and finding themselves in the three seed in the Western Conference. But they struggled down the stretch of the regular season and found themselves against a red hot Pelicans team in the first round. At times, the duo of CJ McCollum and Damian Lillard looked overwhelmed by Davis and Jrue Holiday. It’s yet another playoff disappointment for Lillard, a franchise player who once again committed to Portland and team ownership earlier in the season. That’s why speculation started after the final horn on Saturday that the Blazers might look to move on from Stotts in an effort to shake things up with a perennial contender that hasn’t found a breakthrough in the postseason.
Border Patrol's checkpoints overlooked in debate over wall  [SEP]  LAREDO, Texas — As vehicles line up at the Border Patrol's checkpoint a half-hour drive's north of the U.S.-Mexico border, its agents have around 10 seconds to check each driver and decide which few they will stop for additional inspection. It's a situation challenged constantly by smugglers, sometimes with deadly consequences. In July, 10 migrants died after a tractor-trailer packed with people made it through Laredo North, only to be discovered two hours later in a Walmart parking lot in San Antonio. Dozens of others streamed out of the trailer, gasping for air. The Border Patrol considers its 34 permanent interior checkpoints along the United States' southern border such as Laredo North a crucial layer of its strategy to stop smuggling. The checkpoints inside the U.S. can be up to 100 miles (161 kilometers) from any border, in addition to the ports of entry where people face inspection when coming into the country. But agents who work the Laredo North checkpoint say they're understaffed and sometimes overwhelmed by traffic. And while top Border Patrol officials say President Donald Trump's proposed border wall would help them cut the number of overall smuggling cases, some critics don't believe a wall would reduce illegal immigration and is drawing attention and money away from the checkpoints and other critical needs on the border. The Trump administration's latest budget proposal includes $1.6 billion to start building a wall that the administration has estimated will cost $18 billion. It asks for funding to hire more Border Patrol agents. It also includes $33 million to build a new Border Patrol station in Freer, Texas, northeast of Laredo. But it doesn't directly address needs at other checkpoints, and it proposes zeroing out new spending on tactical infrastructure like roads used by border agents and replacement border fencing. The proposal also would end funding for efforts to find and destroy border tunnels built by cartels to get under existing barriers. Border security experts have warned that constructing a wall will lead to smugglers trying to dig more tunnels. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Laredo Democrat who sits on the U.S. House subcommittee directing homeland security funding, wants U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Border Patrol's parent agency, to invest in additional scanners and other improvements at Laredo North, as well as interceptor boats and radio towers for remote border areas. Cuellar also says the government should fund retention bonuses to keep agents from leaving the patrol. "They're taking money away from proven law enforcement systems to put it into this 14th century solution," Cuellar said. A CBP spokesman declined to comment on the budget request. Built in 2006, Laredo North sits 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of the Rio Grande, the river separating the U.S. and Mexico in Texas. All of the approximately 9,000 daily vehicles that pass Laredo North's seven lanes get an inspection. An agent checks immigration documents and talks to each driver. A camera reads license plates, and another agent guides a dog around each passenger vehicle to search for hidden people or drugs. A fraction of vehicles are sent to a secondary inspection, where agents interview the driver further and search the vehicle. The occasional tractor-trailer is directed to a mobile X-ray machine that scans the interior of the truck. Opponents argue the checkpoints unlawfully restrict the movement of immigrants in the U.S. illegally who live in South Texas, pointing to incidents like the brief detention of a 10-year-old Laredo girl with cerebral palsy who needed surgery at a hospital north of the checkpoints. A Government Accountability Office study released in November said problems with Border Patrol data made it impossible to determine how effective the checkpoints are. Agents do make big catches at such checkpoints. In January, agents at another Laredo checkpoint discovered 76 people inside a tractor-trailer that had been flagged for extra inspection. But the Border Patrol's largest union says agents have low morale and believe large loads of people and drugs are able to get through. "Our agents are understaffed and overworked," said Hector Garza, the Laredo representative of the National Border Patrol Council. "Even though they have all these forces against them, they go out there and try to do their best." Local Border Patrol officials argue that a wall would help agents catch more people at the border, cutting down on the number of cases making it to the checkpoints. In many smuggling cases, authorities say, migrants enter separately and are bundled into trailers on the U.S. side. But Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, an expert on migration who is an associate professor at George Mason University, believes that if a wall is built, immigrants would just find other ways to enter the U.S., including paying smugglers to bring them over in tractor-trailers. Rather than cross the Rio Grande, they would count on successfully sneaking through established ports of entry and interior checkpoints, she argued. "What is the route or what are the means people are going to take?" Correa-Cabrera said. "The ones that they perceive as safer." After illegal border crossings hit a 45-year low last year, according to the Border Patrol's statistics, the agency says apprehension numbers have started to rise. Despite the Trump administration's efforts to discourage people in Central America from migrating to the U.S., authorities in both the U.S. and Mexico are still catching trailers filled with people who sometimes pay $5,000 or more to cartel-controlled smugglers to be taken north. As for cases like the one in July where 10 people died, Jason Owens, the chief Border Patrol agent for the agency's Laredo sector, said his people are trained to make quick decisions about whether to order an extended inspection. But the number of vehicles at times "obscures the ability of the agents to concentrate on the legitimate threats," he said. "It hits all of us very hard," Owens said. "Nobody wants to see somebody perish trying to make it into this country to seek a better life for themselves."
Yonhap news agency says US plane thought to be carrying American war remains from North Korea lands in South Korea  [SEP]  Yonhap news agency says US plane thought to be carrying American war remains from North Korea lands in South Korea SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Yonhap news agency says US plane thought to be carrying American war remains from North Korea lands in South Korea.
Sources: Donald Trump to exit nuclear deal with Iran  [SEP]  US President Donald Trump plans to follow through on his campaign threat to pull out of the landmark nuclear accord with Iran, sources said. The move would deal a profound blow to US allies and potentially deepen the president’s isolation on the world stage. It was not immediately clear which sanctions that were lifted under the deal might be quickly reimposed, said the sources, who were not authorised to speak publicly. In a burst of last-minute diplomacy, punctuated by a visit by UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, the deal’s European members gave in to many of Mr Trump’s demands, according to officials, diplomats and others briefed on the negotiations. Yet they still left convinced he was likely to re-impose sanctions and walk away from the deal he has lambasted since his days as a presidential candidate. The agreement, struck in 2015 by the United States, other world powers and Iran, lifted most US and international sanctions against the country. In return, Iran agreed to restrictions on its nuclear programme making it impossible to produce a bomb, along with rigorous inspections. Mr Trump spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron and Chinese leader Xi Jinping about his decision on Tuesday. Mr Macron’s office said the two spoke about “peace and stability in the Mideast,” without elaborating. Mr Macron vigorously supports the deal and tried to persuade Mr Trump to stay committed to it during a visit to Washington last month. Hours before the announcement, European countries involved in the agreement met to underline their support for it. Senior officials from Britain, France and Germany met in Brussels with Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs, Abbas Araghchi. Building up anticipation, Mr Trump announced on Twitter he would disclose his decision at 2pm (7pm UK time) at the White House. With uncharacteristic discipline, he kept the decision confined to a small group within his National Security Council. In Iran, many were deeply concerned about how Mr Trump’s decision could affect the already struggling economy. In Tehran, President Hassan Rouhani sought to calm nerves, smiling as he appeared at a petroleum expo. He did not name Mr Trump directly, but emphasised that Iran continued to seek “engagement with the world”. “It is possible that we will face some problems for two or three months, but we will pass through this,” Mr Rouhani said.
Second person dies following Saturday's grenade attack at Ethiopia rally, says health minister | Malay Mail  [SEP]  ADDIS ABABA, June 24 — A second person passed away after a deadly grenade attack in Ethiopia’s capital today which injured 150 at rally in support of new Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. “I’m so sorry to learn that we have lost another Ethiopian victim of yesterday’s attack who was in ICU at Black Lion Hospital,” Health Minister Amir Aman said on Twitter today. “My sincere sympathy and condolences to the family, friends & all Ethiopians.” The attack was launched moments after 41-year-old prime minister Abiy, who took office in April, finished his speech to tens of thousands of people gathered in the centre of Addis Ababa.— Bernama
Update: In chilling confession, Jacob Wetterling's fate is finally...  [SEP]  MINNEAPOLIS -- In chilling, horrific and heartbreaking testimony, the man who kidnapped and killed Jacob Wetterling described in court on Tuesday the 11-year-old boy’s last hours and words some 27 years ago. Danny Heinrich, who said he was armed and wore a mask, said Jacob had one question for him after he abducted him, handcuffed him behind his back and forced him into a car on a rural road in St. Joseph, Minn., on Oct. 22, 1989: With Jacob’s parents, Patty and Jerry Wetterling, watching from the front row of the U.S. District Courthouse in Minneapolis, Heinrich, 53, of Annandale, Minn., calmly described the crime in blood-chilling detail. He said he made Jacob undress and then sexually abused the boy. He said Jacob cried after the assault. He said he panicked after a patrol car drove by and shot Jacob twice. He said he left Jacob’s body at the scene, came back an hour later and buried it with a Bobcat. Heinrich’s confession came as part of a plea agreement made by prosecutors and agreed to by the Wetterlings. Heinrich, who had been charged with 25 counts of child pornography, pleaded guilty to one count of receiving child pornography; he faces a prison sentence of 20 years. In return for leading authorities last week to Jacob’s body in rural Paynesville, Minn., and admitting to abducting, sexually assaulting and murdering Jacob, Heinrich will not be charged with Jacob’s murder. “Finally we know. We know what the Wetterling family and all of Minnesota have longed to know since that awful night in 1989,” said U.S. Attorney Andrew Luger. “We know the truth. Danny Heinrich … is the confessed murderer of Jacob Wetterling.” Patty Wetterling, holding back tears during the press conference, said listening to Heinrich’s confession was heartbreaking. “I want to say to Jacob, “I am so sorry,” she said. “It’s incredibly painful to know his last days, last hours, last minutes. Our hearts are hurting. For us, Jacob was alive until we found him.” On the night of Oct. 22, 1989, Heinrich said he was driving on a dead-end road in St. Joseph when he noticed three boys with a flashlight. He said he pulled into a driveway and then waited for the boys -- Jacob, his brother, Trevor, and Jacob’s best friend, Aaron Larson -- to bike and scooter back by. “After about 20 minutes or so, they came back,” Heinrich said. “I stepped out of my car, put on a mask and reached for my revolver. I told them to get in the ditch with their bicycles. I asked their names and their ages.” When Heinrich brandished his .38-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver at the boys, “they tried to offer me a (videotape),” he said. “I knocked that down. They tried to shine a flashlight in my face. I told them not to.” Heinrich then said he told Trevor and Aaron to “run away and not look back” or he would shoot. He then handcuffed Jacob’s hands behind his back and forced the boy into the front seat of his car. Heinrich said he monitored police traffic on his Regency 50-Channel scanner as they drove away from the scene. “I told him to duck down and lean forward in the seat,” he said. “When we got out of town, I told him he could get up.” Heinrich said drove west out of St. Joseph toward Albany, Minn., and then south toward Roscoe, Minn. He said he then drove to a spot near a gravel pit in Paynesville, where he forced Jacob to get out of the car and took off his handcuffs. He then forced him to undress and assaulted him. “About 20 minutes later, he said, ‘I’m cold,’” Heinrich said. “I said, ‘OK, you can get dressed.’” When Jacob said he wanted to go home, Heinrich told him that he couldn’t take him all the way home because he “lived another town away.” When a patrol car drove by, Heinrich said he panicked and loaded his revolver with two rounds of ammunition. “I told him I had to go to the bathroom and to turn around,” Heinrich said. The first shot failed to engage, so Heinrich said he fired again. “I looked back and he was still standing,” he said. “I raised the gun and shot him again, and that’s when he fell to the ground.” Heinrich said he checked to make sure Jacob was dead and then went to his apartment in downtown Paynesville. He said he returned a couple of hours later to bury Jacob’s body after dragging it to a spot “about 100 yards north of where (he) had shot him.” “To bury him and hide the body,” Heinrich replied. But a shovel that Heinrich had brought with him wasn’t big enough to do the job, he said, so he went to a nearby construction company and took a Bobcat that he used to dig a hole and bury Jacob’s body. He said he then camouflaged the area with grass and brush. Jacob was wearing a reflective vest, red jacket and blue sweatpants, Heinrich said, but the boy’s tennis shoes came off as Heinrich was moving the body. Heinrich said he threw the tennis shoes in a ravine about 100 yards down the road as he walked back to his apartment in downtown Paynesville. Heinrich said he returned to the crime scene a year later and could see Jacob’s red jacket above the ground and that the grave was partially uncovered. He said he picked up the jacket and Jacob’s bones and skull and placed them in a garbage bag and “took them across the highway.” “I never dug up anything,” he said. “It was already uncovered.” Heinrich said he used “an Army entrenching tool,” or a collapsible spade, to dig a hole about 2 feet deep and “put the bones in the hole and the jacket on top and covered it up.” When Heinrich led law enforcement officials on Aug. 26 to the gravesite, investigators found a red “St. Cloud Hockey” jacket that matched the one Jacob was wearing when he was abducted. When agents saw the jacket, they “stopped in their tracks,” Luger said. But it wasn’t until they returned to the site Friday and found the boy’s skeletal remains, along with a T-shirt that said “Wetterling,” that prosecutors were confident they had what they needed. “Finally, we knew,” Luger said. “Finally the Wetterling family could lay their son to rest.” In court on Tuesday, Heinrich also confessed to kidnapping and sexually assaulting Jared Scheierl in Cold Spring, Minn., nine months before he abducted and killed Jacob. In chilling detail, Heinrich told of “driving around Cold Spring, looking for a child.” Heinrich said he noticed a boy walking down a dark street about 9 or 10 p.m. on Jan. 13, 1989, and asked him if he knew “where the Kramers lived.” Heinrich said he threw Scheierl in the back seat and sexually assaulted him. He said he then let him go, telling “him to run and not look back or I’d kill him.” He said he kept the Scheierl’s underwear and pants as a “souvenir.” He said he did not have a gun the night he assaulted Scheierl, but acquired one during the summer of 1989, just a few months before Jacob’s death. Retested DNA evidence last year linked Heinrich to Scheierl’s kidnapping and sexual assault. Authorities said they had long suspected a link between Jared and Jacob’s cases, leading them to circle back to Heinrich. But Stearns County Attorney Janelle Kendall said the only hard evidence authorities had tying Heinrich to Jacob’s disappearance back in 1989 was a “similar” tire track and shoe print, neither of which were scientific matches. Luger said Heinrich agreed to take authorities to Jacob’s gravesite after his attorneys, chief federal public defender for Minnesota Katherian Roe and assistant federal public defender Reynaldo Aligada, struck a deal with prosecutors. It was a two-part agreement: The first was to tell authorities the location of Jacob’s remains and provide a detailed confession of what he’d done to the boy. The second was to plead guilty to one child pornography charge and admit that he’d also abducted and assaulted Scheierl. Without Jacob’s body, prosecutors knew they couldn’t pursue murder charges against Heinrich, Luger said. Given his history of “volatile” and “unpredictable,” behavior, Luger said the prosecution felt they had to act. “We knew he could change his mind at any moment,” Luger said. Prosecutors reached out to the Wetterling family to see if they were comfortable with the terms of the tentative deal. With their support, it moved forward, Luger said. “There is great sadness and heartbreak in our state today,” Luger said. “There is an outpouring of grief for Jacob and what he went through and for the Wetterling family … but I hope that this is also a time for neighbors and complete strangers to come together and begin the healing process.” Heinrich is scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 21. As part of his plea, Heinrich has acknowledged that he could be committed civilly after he serves his criminal sentence. Heinrich’s “unthinkable admissions” in court should make everyone angry, Luger said. “We will all ask many times “Why?” and there is no good answer,” he said. “The crimes of Danny Heinrich should increase our collective resolve to protect our youth and bring predators to justice.” Patty Wetterling said she hopes that will be part of Jacob’s legacy. “What I really wanted to say today was about Jacob: He has taught us all how to live, how to love, how to be fair, how to be kind,” Wetterling said. “He speaks to the world that he knew, that we all believe in, and it is a world that is worth fighting for. His legacy will go on.”
The Latest: Police will allow protesters on Chicago freeway  [SEP]  CHICAGO — The Latest on an anti-violence protest on a Chicago interstate (all times local): Illinois State Police say they will allow anti-violence protesters to march along a portion of a Chicago interstate. Police Director Leo Schmitz said in a news release Saturday that an agreement was reached between “all stakeholders” on Thursday. He says state and Chicago police and Illinois Department of Transportation employees will provide a “safety barrier” between motorists and marchers along a stretch of Interstate 94 known as the Dan Ryan Expressway. Hundreds and possibly thousands of people are expected to participate in Saturday’s march. They want to draw attention to the city’s gun violence and pressure public officials to do more to stop it. Police warned earlier this week that any pedestrian who entered the expressway would face arrest and prosecution. Protesters planning to shut down a major Chicago interstate say they’re trying to pressure public officials to address the gun violence that’s claimed hundreds of lives in some of the city’s poorest neighborhoods. There’s also a historical significance to marching along the stretch of Interstate 94 known as the Dan Ryan Expressway. Some believe the roadway was built in the early 1960s to separate white communities and poor, black ones. It was the kind of racial and economic segregation that still exists in Chicago. The Rev. Michael Pfleger is a Roman Catholic priest and anti-violence activist on the city’s South Side who will lead Saturday’s march. He says protesters will carry a banner with a list of demands that includes: more resources, jobs, better schools and stronger gun laws. Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Russia starts studying Black Sea flight recorder  [SEP]  Sochi - Russia's transport minister says investigators have begun to study one of the flight recorders from the plane that crashed into the Black Sea, but says it's still "too early to speak" about what caused the crash. All 92 people on board the Russian military Tu-154 plane are believed to have died in Sunday's crash shortly after take-off from the southern Russian city of Sochi. Rescue workers early on Tuesday found one of the flight recorders on the sea bed about 1.6km away from the shore. Transport Minister Maxim Sokolov told Russian news agencies later on Tuesday that the investigators studying the flight recorders have no information yet pointing to just one theory about the cause. Sokolov repeated, however, that Russian authorities have no information that would make them believe it might have been a terror attack and they saw no possible security breach at Sochi's Adler Airport. The transport ministry earlier said that the flight recorder had not been seriously damaged.
Venezuela plunged into turmoil as top court muzzles congress  [SEP]  Venezuelans have been thrust into a new round of political turbulence after the government-stacked Supreme Court gutted congress of its last vestiges of power, drawing widespread condemnation from foreign governments and sparking calls for protests. Governments across Latin America on Thursday condemned the power grab, with the head of the Organization of American States likening it to a "self-inflicted coup" by socialist President Nicolas Maduro's "regime" against the opposition-controlled congress. In a surprise decision, the magistrates ruled late Wednesday that as long as lawmakers remain in contempt of past rulings, the high court, or an institution it designates, can assume the constitutionally assigned powers of the National Assembly, which has been controlled by the opposition for nearly a year and a half. The ruling and one earlier in the week limiting lawmakers' immunity from prosecution capped a feud that began when the long-marginalized opposition won control of the legislature by a landslide in December 2015 and then mounted a campaign to force Maduro from office. The leftist leader, who has seen his approval ratings plunge amid widespread food shortages and triple-digit inflation, responded by relying on the Supreme Court to unseat several lawmakers and then routinely nullify all legislation voted there. "This isn't any old sentence. It marks a point of no return on the road to dictatorship," said Freddy Guevara, the No. 2 leader in congress. Peru's government immediately recalled its ambassador in protest of what it called "a flagrant break in the democratic order." Chile's left-of-center president, who has been reluctant to openly criticize Maduro, said she was deeply worried by the ruling and ordered her ambassador to return home for consultations. The U.S. State Department reiterated its call for Maduro to free political prisoners and hold immediate elections to resolve the crisis, saying the court decision to "usurp" the National Assembly's powers represented a "serious setback for democracy in Venezuela." OAS Secretary General Luis Almagro called for an emergency meeting of the regional group, which held two angry sessions on Venezuela earlier this week. That meeting ended with 20 governments led by the U.S. and Mexico voicing deep concern about the Venezuelan situation but no concrete actions to hold Maduro accountable. Luis Vicente Leon, a Caracas-based pollster, said that while the ruling completely "pulverizes the separation of powers," Venezuela long ago stopped operating like a normal democracy with a clear rule of law and independent institutions. He sees the government hardening its position in the face of mounting economic woes and international pressure, further dashing hopes for dialogue and an electoral solution. "It's perfectly predictable that the government is going to keep radicalizing," he said. The main opposition alliance said it was holding around-the-clock meetings to determine its next steps, but some leaders were already calling for protests as early as Saturday. Meanwhile, some hard-liners called for the military, the traditional arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela and an important crutch for Maduro, to intervene. While the capital was generally quiet Thursday, as night fell a few people in wealthier eastern Caracas gathered on balconies and in front of homes banging pots and pans and shouting "Get out Maduro!" "The 30 million Venezuelans need to take to the streets and confront the dictatorship," said Daniela Tani, a coordinator for one of Venezuela's opposition groups who joined about 50 people briefly blocking one of major roadways in Caracas. The protesters waved flags and stopped traffic until being surrounded by police trying to clear the street. But it was not clear if critics of the government were in the mood for another street fight after past attempts fizzled or ended in bloodshed with little to show. Weeks of unrest in 2014 resulted in more than 40 deaths and dozens of arrests, while a mass protest last September was followed by authorities a few days later cancelling a recall petition campaign seeking to force Maduro from office before his term ends in 2019. The Supreme Court's ruling stemmed from congress' refusal to authorize Venezuela's state-run oil company to form joint ventures with private companies, including Russia's Rosneft. State media said the ruling was not seeking to supplant congress but rather to guarantee the rule of law so long as legislators remains obstructionist by refusing to sign off on a budget and key economic decisions. Maduro kept out of the debate, appearing twice Thursday on state TV but leaving to his aides to denounce his critics. "We denounce the conspiracy by the region's right-wing to attack Venezuela's democratic system," Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez said on Twitter.
Cambodian spying verdict due for Australian who flew drone  [SEP]  PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) — An Australian filmmaker arrived at a Cambodian court to hear his verdict Friday on a charge of violating national security that carries up to 10 years in prison. Cambodia has released almost two dozen jailed critics or opponents of Prime Minister Hun Sen's government in recent weeks, raising hopes that James Ricketson may also be freed. He arrived alone to the Phnom Penh court in a prison van, later telling The Associated Press from a waiting room, "I hope I am free today and I could go home." Ricketson, 69, has been held since June last year when he was detained after flying a drone to photograph an opposition party political rally. The charge against Ricketson is tantamount in legal terms to espionage, but prosecutors never specified which foreign power he allegedly spied for. The leniency shown to opponents and critics following the July election followed a pattern of Hun Sen's long rule, with a harsh crackdown on opponents and critics preceding the vote and royal pardons, clemency and conciliatory moves after he wins a resounding victory. The evidence presented against Ricketson appeared thin. A handful of personal emails seized from Ricketson suggested he was sympathetic to the country's political opposition and critical of Hun Sen's government, but revealed no sensitive or secret information. Several of his photos and videos showed security forces on duty, but only in publicly viewable situations. Questions and statements from the prosecutors at his trial indicated Ricketson was suspected of working with the opposition Cambodian National Rescue Party, which for a time had enough popularity among Cambodians to be a viable challenger to Hun Sen's rule. The party, however, was dissolved by a court ruling last November that assured Hun Sen's party of its sweeping victory. Ricketson testified in his defense that he made contacts with the opposition party strictly for journalistic purposes while making a documentary film. He recounted a filmmaking career dating to the 1970s, and presented acclaimed Australian movie director Peter Weir to attest to his professionalism in the field. Ricketson's other character witnesses were several Cambodians, including his informally adopted daughter, who described how he had provided financial assistance to them and other poor members of Cambodian society.
Journalist shot dead during live broadcast in Nicaragua  [SEP]  A reporter was shot and killed during a live broadcast from an area of Nicaragua roiled by violent anti-government protests this week, local media reported. The man, identified in Nicaraguan media as Angel Gahona, was reporting live in the town of Bluefields in the country’s southern Caribbean coast, when a shot rang out and he fell to the ground bleeding in the head, video footage showed. Gahona was describing a damaged cash machine while videoing with his phone as a cameraman filmed behind him. Local newspaper El Nuevo Diario said he was broadcasting live on Facebook. The shot ended his commentary, sending Gahona tumbling down the steps in front of the building. He then lay prone as people screamed his name and rushed to help, the footage showed. Neither authorities in Managua, nor Lissett Guido, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Nicaragua, were immediately able to independently confirm details of the incident, which quickly spread on to national, international and social media. Nicaraguan media said Gahona, who was described as a journalist from the area, died from his injuries. It was not clear who had fired the shot. Nicaraguan newspaper La Prensa quoted another journalist as saying only police and groups fighting the protesters were armed there. After the incident, the Red Cross said at least seven people had died since protests began on Wednesday against government plans to increase worker contributions and lower pensions, causing a crisis for president Daniel Ortega. Local human rights groups reported that as many as 25 people had died by Sunday. – Reuters
Obama hits campaign trail for Clinton in Philadelphia  [SEP]  Obama hits campaign trail for Clinton in Philadelphia WASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama will hit the campaign trail Tuesday to rally support for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, a state that has served as a firewall for her party in the past six general elections but is now viewed as competitive. Obama is scheduled to appear without the candidate herself. Clinton was scheduled to make a fundraising swing to California, but will take a couple of days off from the campaign trail after being diagnosed with pneumonia. Obama will seek to generate momentum for Clinton in a race that has become uncomfortably close for many Democratic supporters. The latest poll by Quinnipiac University found her with a 5 percentage point edge over Republican Donald Trump in Pennsylvania. Obama will speak at a plaza in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. He'll also attend a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee in Philadelphia and then fly to New York City for a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee fundraiser. The candidate Obama hopes will succeed him left a 9/11 ceremony after about 90 minutes Sunday and struggled to stay on her feet while she was helped into a van. Her campaign said she had "overheated," but later revealed that she had been diagnosed Friday with pneumonia. The episode played into Trump's efforts in recent weeks to raise doubts about Clinton's stamina. Clinton's campaign was already on the defensive after she used the term "basket of deplorables" to describe half of Trump's supporters. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama doesn't feel like he needs to help Clinton with damage control. "I think the president's belief that she'd be an excellent president of the United States is something that you've heard him say many times. And I can tell you there's nothing that happened yesterday that has changed that assessment at all," Earnest said. Earnest deflected several questions Monday about whether both candidates were being forthcoming enough in releasing details about their health. He said it's ultimately the candidates themselves who have to make the decision about what kind of information they release and the level of detail. Still, he said that Obama remains confident Clinton has the strength to carry out the demands of the presidency. When asked about Clinton's use of the term "basket of deplorables," Earnest made clear that "it's not the president's phrase." But he also said there has been a "disturbing tendency on the part of Republicans in Washington, D.C., to try to appeal to extremists for political support."
Jordan releases soldier who killed 7 Israeli schoolgirls  [SEP]  AMMAN - A Jordanian soldier who shot dead seven Israeli schoolgirls in 1997 was released from prison Sunday after serving out his life sentence, sparking outrage from the families of those killed. In March 1997, Ahmad Dakamseh fired an automatic weapon at schoolgirls on a trip to the Jordan-Israel border, killing seven of them and wounding five others and a teacher. “He is now a free man,” his cousin Mohammed Yahya Dakamseh told AFP by phone, saying he had been released at around 1:00 am after “he finished his jail term”. Dakamseh, who is aged 46 according to a family member, was released from the Bab al-Hawa prison in Irbid, 90 kilometres (60 miles) north of the capital Amman. He had been sentenced to life imprisonment, which in Jordan is 20 years. Dakamseh, who hails from Irbid’s Ebder area, was a married father-of-three at the time of the attack. His motives were never entirely clear, but he told the national security court during his trial that he fired his weapon at the schoolgirls after they mocked him while he was praying. Jordan’s then ruler King Hussein condemned the attack and later travelled to Israel to offer his condolences to the families of the murdered schoolgirls. His government also paid compensation. The attack came less than three years after Jordan and Israel signed a peace treaty. Dakamseh was driven home on Sunday in a convoy of dozens of cars whose drivers were honking their horns, a video shared on social media showed. Dakamseh’s brother Bassem said the family home was full of well-wishers. “He is in good health, wearing a black suit among his relatives and close family including his 78-year-old mother,” his brother said. Videos circulated on social media showed Dakamseh greeting relatives and posing for selfies with visitors. Dakamseh told Jordanian media on Sunday that he was “against any destabilisation in the country”, but that his opinion of Israelis had not changed. “As for my position on the Zionists, you all know... what I did 20 years ago,” he said. There was no immediate official reaction from neighbouring Israel, but relatives of the slain schoolgirls slammed Dakamseh’s release. “This morning takes us back 20 years, to that horrible day,” said Hezi Cohen, whose daughter Nirit was shot dead in the attack. “I’d like to tell the (Israeli) prime minister and defence minister: Our children’s blood should not be worthless,” he told Israeli news website Ynet. “You should have acted vis-a-vis Jordan to prevent this release at any cost.” Orit Cohen, whose sister Keren was killed, said: “Who says that tomorrow he (Dakamseh) won’t carry out another attack and murder more Israelis?” Israel Fatihi, whose daughter Sivan was killed in the attack, said the Israeli ambassador to Jordan had warned them of the Jordanian’s release. Dakamseh “was called a hero in the Jordanian parliament at the time of the murder,” he said. “If that’s what they said in parliament, what can we expect from the family?” Israel’s “peace with Jordan is between us (Israelis) and the royal family — not the people or the parliament,” Fatihi said. After the 1997 killings, Jordanian police said they prevented 100 people including two Islamist members of parliament from paying a solidarity visit to Dakamseh’s family. But 21 other lawmakers in a statement condemned the massacre, saying the holy war mentioned in the Quran did not authorise the killing of children. Dakamseh, who suffers from high blood pressure and diabetes, was hospitalised in 2014 after he went on a five-day hunger strike to demand his release. His strike followed Jordanian lawmakers demanding his release after Israeli soldiers killed a Jordanian judge in a scuffle at the Allenby Bridge border crossing with the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Jordan in 2011 had to distance itself from a newly appointed minister’s remarks that Dakamseh was a “hero” after Israel summoned Jordan’s ambassador. Then justice minister Hussein Mujalli, who had also been Dakamseh’s lawyer, said he was a “hero” and did not deserve prison. Jordan is the only Arab nation besides Egypt to have signed a peace treaty with the Jewish state..
Young woman killed in Charlottesville, Virginia car attack identified  [SEP]  A young woman killed when a young man drove a Dodge Challenger into a group of people during white supremacist protests that turned violent Charlottesville, Virginia on Saturday (Aug 12) has been identified as Heather Heyer, 32, a paralegal from a neighbouring town. Heyer was left lying on the pavement next to another victim, the New York Daily News reported,after the car ploughed into the crowd but it was not known if she died at the scene. The paper said she had apparently come to town to join others in staging a counter-protest to the rally by white supremacists, the paper said, in the picturesque town that is home to the University of Virginia. The Independent noted that in her last posting on facebook, Heyer had written: "If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention." Heyer's mother said in the statement on a GoFundMe page set up in her daughter's name that: "She died doing what was right. My heart is broken, but I am forever proud of her." A friend, Felicia Correa, said on the GoFundMe page that Heyer was "murdered while protesting hate". "She will truly be missed," she wrote. The GoFundMe page had already surpassed its target of raising US$50,000 ($68,000) by Sunday afternoon (Aug 13). The paper said Heyer was from Stanardsville, Virginia, some 40 kilometres from Charlottesville but worked a paralegal at the Miller Law Group in college town, according to her LinkedIn page. A vigil was planned in her honour later Sunday evening in Charlottesville's Emancipation Park, which had been the scene of the white nationalist rally and counter-protests on Saturday. The driver of the Dodge Challenger that plowed into the crowd was alleged to be James Fields, a 20-year-old man from Maumee, Ohio. Police arrested him and lhe was charged with second-degree murder, and other crimes connected related to the hit-and-run. The Daily News ran a photo of the man it identified as the suspect that it said it had taken earlier in a group of white men holding black-and-white shields emblazoned with logo of Vanguard America, a neo-Nazi hate group. Two others were killed as a result of the violence on Saturday. A Virginia State Police helicopter that was assisting those despatched to bring the violence on the ground under control crashed near a golf course and burst into flames. The pilot, Lt H Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, and Berke MM Bates, 40, a trooper-pilot of Quinton, Virginia., died at the scene.
Western Digital seeks arbitration on Toshiba chips unit sale  [SEP]  TOKYO (AP) — Western Digital is seeking arbitration in a dispute with its joint venture partner Toshiba Corp. over the sale of the Japanese electronics giant’s computer-chip business. Toshiba wants to sell the lucrative chips unit to shore up its finances, but Western Digital is demanding Toshiba first obtain its consent. Tokyo-based Toshiba forecast Monday a 950 billion yen ($8.4 billion) loss for the fiscal year that ended in March. That report was issued without the endorsement of Toshiba’s auditors. Western Digital said in a statement that several of its SanDisk subsidiaries have filed a request for arbitration with the ICC International Court of Arbitration over plans to sell its NAND flash-memory joint ventures with Toshiba. The request seeks to block the sale, arguing it would be violation of their joint venture agreement. The arbitration will take place in San Francisco, it said. “Seeking relief through mandatory arbitration was not our first choice in trying to resolve this matter. However, all of our other efforts to achieve a resolution to date have been unsuccessful, and so we believe legal action is now a necessary next step,” said Western Digital Chief Executive Steve Milligan. Toshiba President, Satoshi Tsunakawa, who has acknowledged that the company’s strategy based on Westinghouse was a mistake, said he doesn’t think Western Digital can block Toshiba. “With regards to your first question as to whether this may delay bidding procedures, we will try to dispel such concerns by explaining to all potential bidders the validity of Toshiba’s position,” he told reporters. Toshiba described the financial results it released Monday as “projections,” rather than results. The dismal figures were in line with earlier estimates. Toshiba’s U.S. nuclear business Westinghouse has filed for bankruptcy protection. Its losses, and a years’ long accounting scandal are imperiling the company’s future. Toshiba’s earnings reports, meanwhile, have been delayed by questions over its acquisition of U.S. nuclear construction company CB&I Stone and Webster. Toshiba said it expects to post a profit of 50 billion yen ($442 million) for the fiscal year through March 2018. Costs in the nuclear industry have ballooned since the March 2011 tsunami in northeastern Japan, when three reactors at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant sank into meltdowns, and stricter safeguards are required to operate and build reactors.

Austria Ready to Protect Its Borders if German Migrant Deal Becomes Gov’t Policy  [SEP]  Austria, which is currently holding rotating presidency in the EU, warned that it is prepared to take measures for the protection of the country's southern borderwith Slovenia and Italy if the agrrement on the migration issue in Germany becomes government policy. According to the Austrian government, if the deal reached on Monday between Chancellor Angela Merkel and German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer is endorsed by the government, "we will be obliged to take measures to avoid disadvantages for Austria and its people." The migration consensus in Germany prompted anxiety in Austria, since "Germany wants to take national measures to tackle migration flows," as said in the statement. The government's statement refers to the deal concluded after tense negotiations between the the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) headed by Merkel and the Christian Social Union (CSU) headed by Seehofer. According to the interior minister, who demanded that Germany must have an opportunity to reject migrants direct at the border, the two conservative parties had agreed to tighten border controls. In June, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz suggested that Austrian, German and Italian interior ministers form "axis" against illegal immigration.
Saudi Arabia seeks death penalty for woman activist: rights groups  [SEP]  RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s public prosecutor is seeking the death penalty against five human rights activists from the kingdom’s Eastern Province currently on trial in a secretive terrorism court, groups including Human Rights Watch (HRW) said. Among the detainees is Israa al-Ghomgham, whom Saudi activists said was the first woman to possibly face the death penalty for rights-related work. Charges against her include incitement to protest and providing moral support to rioters. “Any execution is appalling, but seeking the death penalty for activists like Israa al-Ghomgham, who are not even accused of violent behaviour, is monstrous,” Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at HRW, said in a statement on Wednesday. A government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Activists said the trial was ongoing, and denied social media reports that the detainees had already been executed. Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy where public protests and political parties are banned, has enacted some high-profile social and economic reforms in recent years under powerful young Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. They have, however, been accompanied by a crackdown on dissent, with dozens of clerics, intellectuals and activists arrested in the past year, including women who had campaigned for the right to drive in the deeply conservative Muslim country. A roundup of senior royals, ministers and businessmen last November on charges of corruption sent shockwaves through the kingdom, stunning allies and foreign investors. Most of those detainees were released after reaching undisclosed financial settlements with the government. Ghomgham is a prominent Shi’ite Muslim activist who documented mass demonstrations in the Eastern Province starting in 2011. She was arrested from her home in December 2015 along with her husband. Most of the country’s Shi’ite minority lives in the oil-producing Eastern Province and some have complained that their religious ceremonies are banned or interfered with by Sunni authorities, and that they lack opportunities for work and education. The government has denied the charges. Saudi Arabia has previously executed Shi’ite activists on what rights groups called politically-motivated charges. It views protests among Shi’ites in the context of tensions with Shi’ite power and regional rival Iran, which it has accused of fomenting the unrest. The authorities have carried out security operations against suspected Shi’ite militants in the Eastern Province, which has seen unrest and occasional armed attacks for years.
9/11 terror attack accomplice walks free after 12 years in prison  [SEP]  A Moroccan man convicted of helping some of the 9/11 suicide pilots will be deported from Germany to his home country today. Mounir el-Motassadeq, 44, was a member of a group of radical Islamists based in Hamburg, northern Germany, and found guilty of helping bring about the 2001 terror attacks in the United States which killed nearly 3,000 people. Motassadeq associated with several of the 9/11 hijackers, and in 2007, prosecutors proved that he handled their finances, and even signed the will of Mohamed Atta, the man who piloted the plane which hit World Trade Centre's North Tower. Handed the maximum sentence of 15 years in 2007 for being an accessory to mass murder, Motassadeq is one of only two men convicted to date of involvement in the plot. Photographs taken earlier today show a man with his eyes covered, identified as Motassadeq, being led by two armed policemen to a helicopter. German media reported that he would be taken to Frankfurt to be deported to Morocco, where his wife and children lives. 'Everything is going according to plan,' said a spokesman for the state of Hamburg's interior ministry, declining to give details, other than to say that Motassadeq's release was permissible from October 15 if he was deported immediately. Once in Morocco, Motassadeq will be a free man, however, experts say he is likely to be closely monitored by local authorities. Phil Gurski, a former strategic analyst in the Canadian intelligence community, told Deutsche Welle that the Moroccan government will most likely gather intel on him and pass it on to the United States. However, he added: 'I'd be very surprised if the US had no interest in him.' Local news has previously reported that Motassadeq had been due to remain in prison until early 2019, and it is not known why he appears to have been granted early release. El Motassadeq was convicted of being part of the so-called Hamburg cell, including Atta and fellow Sept. 11 pilots Marwan al-Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah. German courts ruled that Motassadeq was aware the three planned to hijack and crash planes, even though he might not have known the specifics of the plot. They said Motassadeq had helped "watch the attackers' backs and conceal them" by doing things such as helping them keep up the appearance of being regular university students paying tuition and rent fees, and transferring money. El Motassadeq acknowledged training at an al-Qaida camp in Afghanistan, but insisted he knew nothing of his friends' plans to attack the U.S. 'I swear by God that I did know the attackers were in America,' he shouted in accented German at a sentencing hearing. 'I swear by God that I did not know what they wanted to do.' His attorney, Jan Jacob, refused to comment on the deportation, which brings to an end a lengthy legal saga in Germany. Originally arrested in Hamburg in November 2001, el Motassadeq was convicted in 2003 of membership in a terrorist organization and thousands of counts of accessory to murder - taking into account victims on the ground - becoming the first person convicted anywhere on charges related to Sept. 11. He was sentenced to the maximum 15 years in prison. However, a federal court overturned that verdict in 2004, largely because of a lack of evidence from al-Qaida suspects in U.S. custody, and sent the case back to Hamburg. After a 2005 retrial, Motassadeq was again convicted of membership in a terrorist organization that included Atta, al-Shehhi and Jarrah. But he was acquitted of being an accessory to murder after the court ruled it didn't have enough evidence that he knew of the hijackers' plot. Motassadeq was sentenced to seven years in prison at the time, but was freed in early 2006 until his appeal could be heard. Later that year, the federal court reversed the Hamburg court's acquittal of Motassadeq on the accessory to murder charges, ruling that the evidence knew the plotters planned to hijack and crash planes. It limited the number of counts, however, to the 246 people killed aboard the airplanes and the 15-year sentence was restored. Authorities in Hamburg said they would confirm the deportation once it has taken place.
Yugoslav army veteran lobs grenade at U.S. embassy in Montenegro, then blows himself up  [SEP]  PODGORICA (Reuters) - A Yugoslav army veteran who manned anti-aircraft defenses during the NATO bombing in 1999 tossed a hand grenade into the U.S. embassy compound in Podgorica, capital of Montenegro, around midnight and then blew himself up, police said on Thursday. The embassy on its Facebook page said all its personnel were safe after the incident and there were no reports either of material damage. The Montenegrin man, aged about 41 and born in Serbia, was identified by police only by the initials D.J., though media named him as Dalibor Jaukovic, a decorated Yugoslav army veteran. "He was a real patriot during the NATO bombing. He served with the Yugoslav anti-aircraft defenses," Milutin Dragicevic, who described himself as a distant relative told Reuters. (Graphic:http://tmsnrt.rs/2EZMedo) In 1999 NATO planes bombed targets in Montenegro and Serbia which together formed rump-Yugoslavia at the time, to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians in Serbia's then southern province of Kosovo. Montenegro, the smallest of all former Yugoslav republics, became the 29th country to join NATO last May. At just before midnight, the man lobbed a hand grenade over the embassy compound fence and then blew himself up, assistant police chief, Enis Bakovic, told reporters. Bakovic said an investigation was underway to determine whether he had acted alone or with others. "We are searching social media together with the FBI," he said. "There are no indications this was an act of terrorism," prosecutor Lepa Medenica said. Policemen with submachine guns and police vehicles patrolled streets near the embassy building on Thursday morning following the incident. A neighbor who said her name was Branka told Reuters that Jaukovic "was an ordinary, normal man." "He was always polite to me," she said. Though the embassy said all staff were safe, it closed for issuing visas on Thursday and told U.S. citizens to stay away until further notice. "The U.S. embassy in Podgorica advises U.S. citizens there is an active security situation at the U.S. embassy in Podgorica," it said on its website.

At least 4 wounded, shooter dead at Tallahassee yoga studio, authorities say  [SEP]  Tallahassee police are investigating a shooting in a bar and restaurant complex near Bradfordville and Thomasville roads Friday evening. TALLAHASSEE, Fla. – An unidentified man shot and killed himself Friday evening after wounding at least four people at a yoga studio, according to Tallahassee officials. City spokeswoman Alison Faris confirmed that the shooter was dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. City Manager Reese Goad said four people were wounded. A short time later, Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare spokeswoman Danielle Buchanan said five patients were brought to the hospital. She didn’t know the condition of the patients, but they were being assessed. Alex Redding was in a bar downstairs from the Hot Yoga studio when a woman ran in hyperventilating followed by a man with blood on his head. Redding said two to three other people entered the bar seeking assistance and said that a tall man with a beard was inside the studio acting strange and began shooting during the class. The man with blood on his head told the patrons he tried to stop the shooter but was pistol-whipped before the shooter then shot himself. Tallahassee Police are reporting a shooting at a Yoga studio at a bar and restaurant complex near Bradfordville and Thomasville roads Friday evening. The incident immediately interrupted the gubernatorial campaign of Mayor Andrew Gillum, who tweeted he was "deeply appreciative of law enforcement's quick response to the shooting at the yoga facility in Tallahassee today." "No act of gun violence is acceptable," he wrote. "I'm in close communication with law enforcement officials and will be returning to Tallahassee tonight." It is unclear the extent of the injuries of those wounded. Outside the bar, crowds began to gather including State Attorney Jack Campbell and Commissioner Scott Maddox.
Total to sign Iran gas deal, biggest since sanctions lifted  [SEP]  French energy giant Total will finally sign its multi-billion-dollar agreement to develop an Iranian offshore gas field on Monday, the oil ministry said, in the biggest foreign deal since sanctions were eased last year. "The international agreement for the development of phase 11 of South Pars will be signed on Monday in the presence of the oil ministry and managers of Total, the Chinese company CNPC and Iranian company Petropars," a ministry spokesman told AFP. Total signed a preliminary deal with Iran in November, taking a 50.1 percent stake in the $4.8 billion (4.2 billion euro) project. China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) will own 30 percent and Petropars 19.9 percent. Total will put in an initial $1 billion for the first stage of the 20-year project. It was initially due to sign the contract in early 2017, but CEO Patrick Pouyanne said in February that it would wait to see whether the US adminstration of President Donald Trump reimposed sanctions on Iran. Trump threatened during his campaign to tear up the landmark accord between Iran and six world powers that came into force in January 2016 and eased sanctions in exchange for curbs to Tehran's nuclear programme. His administration has taken a tough line on Iran and imposed fresh sanctions related to its ballistic missile programme and military activities in the region. But the White House has kept the nuclear deal alive, continuing to waive the relevant sanctions every few months as required under the agreement. It is in the midst of a 90-day review on whether to stick with the nuclear deal, although any move to abandon it will be strongly opposed by the other signatories Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Monday's signing will mark Total's return to Iran, which has the second-largest gas reserves and fourth-largest oil reserves in the world. The French firm led development of phases two and three of South Pars in the 1990s, but effectively left Iran in 2012 when France joined European Union partners in imposing sanctions, including an oil embargo. "We're the first Western major to return to Iran. We're very happy," Pouyanne told AFP when the initial deal was signed in November. Iran's oil officials have been keen to attract Western investment and know-how to improve the outdated energy infrastructure. Preliminary agreements were also signed in December with Shell and Russia's Gazprom to develop oil and gas projects. Such deals have not been without controversy in Iran, where the memory of exploitation by foreign firms in the early 20th century remains a highly sensitive topic. Conservatives criticised the move to award tenders to foreign firms last year, forcing the oil ministry to state that domestic conglomerates, including one controlled by the elite Revolutionary Guards, would be allowed to compete. The first stage of the new 20-year project at South Pars will cost around $2 billion and consist of 30 wells and two well-head platforms connected to existing onshore treatment facilities. The site will eventually pump 50.9 million cubic metres (1.8 billion cubic feet) of gas per day into Iran's national grid.
Signs Of Hope At Oroville Dam, After Water Overflowed Emergency Spillway  [SEP]  The area around a huge dam at California's second-largest reservoir is in a state of emergency, with some 180,000 residents of the area ordered to evacuate Sunday out of fears that part of Oroville Dam could fail. A glimmer of hope arrived late Sunday night, when officials said water had finally stopped pouring over the dam's emergency spillway. The secondary spillway was in use because the main spillway had developed a huge hole, stressed by the need to release water accumulated from California's wet winter — and brought to a new crisis point by last week's heavy rains. "So the lake rose 50 feet in just a few days," Dan Brekke of member station KQED tells Morning Edition, "and got up to this emergency spillway which had never been used since the dam went into service in 1968. And on Saturday morning, it began pouring over there." Residents of the area some 70 miles north of Sacramento were placed under evacuation orders at around 4:30 p.m. Sunday, after the reservoir rose to a record level — more than a foot above what's considered "full" — and its main spillway struggled to provide relief and its auxiliary spillway was seen at risk of failing. At the time, officials said that dangerous flooding could be just hours away. Even as the evacuation orders were issued, officials had reason to hope that Lake Oroville would soon begin to recede, due to a drop in the amount of runoff water entering the lake and a dry weather forecast. But the reservoir's infrastructure was struggling to cope. "The lake is considered full at 901 feet [above sea level], and it's at that level that it began pouring over an emergency spillway early Saturday," KQED reports. The lake kept rising, surpassing its "full" level by more than a foot. Last night, Lake Oroville's water level finally dropped below 900 feet around midnight, in a trend that has continued into Monday morning. As for the residents and evacuees, Brekke says he has seen many confused, scared people — one woman's son, he says, compared the evacuation to a zombie apocalypse. And another woman said she's still worrying over the family members who weren't able to leave. "My daughter-in-law is still there with her sister, who is bedridden, but we've got her in a wheelchair. They were supposed to be sending an ambulance or someone to help transport her out. And nobody has shown up for her yet. She called 911, and 911 said they weren't sending anybody else out." Overnight, evacuation centers and shelters were still in the process of being outfitted with beds and blankets. Gov. Jerry Brown issued an emergency order last night to help with the process, which saw shelters erected at fairgrounds to handle the thousands of people leaving Oroville and other downstream areas.
Qatar Foundation and Qatar Shell Sign Undergraduate Research Co-Funding Agreement  [SEP]  Her Excellency Sheikha Hind bint Hamad Al Thani, Vice Chairperson and CEO of Qatar Foundation (QF) today signed an agreement between QF and Qatar Shell which will see the energy company co-fund Qatar National Research Fund’s (QNRF) Undergraduate Research Experience Program (UREP). The signing ceremony was held at QF Headquarters in Education City, and attended by Her Excellency Sheikha Hind and Andrew Faulkner, Managing Director and Chairman of Qatar Shell Companies. As one of the research funding programs of QF member QNRF, UREP supports undergraduate students from universities across Qatar to conduct research under the mentorship of their professors in areas of direct relevance to addressing Qatar’s national priorities, aligning with QF’s mission to develop human capital through investment in education, science, research, and innovation. Under the agreement, UREP will become a QNRF-Qatar Shell co-funded program. Her Excellency Sheikha Hind said: “The value of partnership is illustrated through its capacity to harness expertise, enable the exchange of knowledge, and maximize multisectoral efforts designed to address national challenges. “QF recognizes that building such partnerships can amplify the impact of our mission to support the development of Qatar, and the agreement signed today is a reflection of this belief in the power of collaboration. The co-funding of our Undergraduate Research Experience Program will support young scientists and innovators to pursue and realize their ideas under expert mentorship, equipping them to play their part in developing effective and impactful solutions that help to build a diverse and sustainable economy for our nation.” Mr. Faulkner said: “At Shell, we champion open innovation and partnerships with locally-based research institutions and universities. “Under the agreement, Qatar Shell will not only co-fund UREP but also provide in-kind support by leveraging the R&D expertise from Qatar Shell Research and Technology Centre (QSRTC). This is also aligned to Qatar Shell’s objectives to contribute to the Qatar National Vision 2030 and our shared commitment to foster the research and innovation ecosystem through collaboration and knowledge transfer.”
NY governor touts plan to fix subway line without shutdown  [SEP]  ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is seeking to reassure skeptics about his surprise plan to repair a key subway tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn without a long-dreaded 15-month shutdown. The Democrat spoke to reporters about his proposal on Friday, a day after announcing the L-train shutdown wasn't necessary. He urged the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to quickly vote on his plan, which would allow trains to run during repairs. Cuomo says similar approaches have worked in Europe and Asia. News of an April shutdown had prompted some Brooklynites to change jobs or move. Transit officials had said the closure was needed to repair damage from 2012's Superstorm Sandy. Cuomo says he directed engineers to take another look after a Brooklyn man confronted him about the aggravation of the shutdown.
Is This Donald Trump's Re-Election Master Plan?  [SEP]  The conventional wisdom in presidential campaigns is that you play to the base to win the nomination and pivot to the center in the general election. With Donald Trump, the pivot never came. He kept playing to his rabid base and has consistently done so throughout the eight months of his presidency. But has his pivot finally arrived? Cue The Chuck & Nancy Show. Fed up with Republican leadership, Trump’s cozied up to Democrats in an effort to make deals with the goal of ‘winning’ and reversing his abysmal approval ratings. Rather than work with Senate Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, he’s marginalized them over DACA, border security, the debt ceiling and Hurricane Harvey aid. And in the same week he’s also backpeddled on his border wall and the Iran nuclear deal. “Exactly what @realDonaldTrump campaigned on. Not,” tweeted Andrea Ingraham. She later added, “BUILD THE WALL! BUILD THE WALL! … or … maybe … not really.” So is Trump’s sucking up to Chuck and Nancy part of a much bigger political calculation? Has he realized that the re-election math makes way more sense if he pivots from his 30 percent base and starts providing policy goodies to the other 70 percent instead? “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose any voters,” Trump once infamously crowed. So far the MAGA crowd’s proven Trump dead right. No matter how much he lies to them or reneges on campaign promises, the base stays loyal and committed. As such, perhaps Trump knows he has nothing to lose and everything to gain by shifting his focus to moderate Republicans, independents and, yes, even Democrats. Maybe he knows that an electorate so exhausted and frustrated with crazy Trump may be ready to embrace mainstream Trump. And that the base will manage to find a way to justify it all and stick with him. One thing we’ve learned time and again with Trump is never to under-estimate his instincts and political barometer. So here’s my perfect storm: his bi-partisan shift is real and sustained over time; he weens himself off Twitter and the persistent trouble it causes him (i.e this weekend when he retweeted a fake video inciting violence against Hillary Clinton, while also referring to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un as “Rocket Man”); and he somehow manages to survive the Russia investigations. If he succeeds, we just might be looking at another four years of this roller-coaster presidency...
ISIS Releases Recording Said to Be of Its Leader  [SEP]  The Islamic State issued on Thursday what appears to be the first recording in nearly a year of its reclusive leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, a move that seems intended to silence rumors of his death and to galvanize his pummeled troops. The 46-minute audio recording would be the first time since last November that supporters of the jihadist group have heard the voice of their self-proclaimed caliph. Since then, the group has lost significant territory, including Mosul, Iraq, which had been the largest city under its control, and much of the group’s capital, Raqqa, Syria. In the recording, Mr. Baghdadi praised his foot soldiers for waging a tenacious battle in Mosul. “They fulfilled their promise and their responsibility, and they did not give up except over their skulls and body parts,” he said. “Thus they were excused, after nearly a year of fighting and confrontation.” He also accused the American-backed troops they faced of using scorched-earth tactics. “They burned the people, trees, and everything on the ground,” he said, according to a translation provided by the SITE Intelligence Group. But instead of pondering those losses, Mr. Baghdadi, 46, emphasized the threat the West still faces from the Islamic State, making indirect references to recent attacks on the Underground in London, in the heart of Barcelona and in Russia. “Now the Americans, the Russians, and the Europeans are living in terror in their countries, fearing the strikes of the mujahedeen,” he said. The recording, which was widely disseminated to Islamic State supporters in their chat rooms on the messaging app Telegram, begins with the voice of a narrator who introduces Mr. Baghdadi and adds, “May Allah protect him.” That phrase is used to refer to people who are still living and is intended to signal that Mr. Baghdadi is not dead, contrary to reports over the summer. The recording also cites current events, including the growing nuclear threat from North Korea, suggesting that it was recorded in recent weeks. In June, the Russian military said it might have killed Mr. Baghdadi in a strike on Islamic State leaders in May near Raqqa. In July, a British-based monitoring organization, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said senior Islamic State commanders had confirmed that Mr. Baghdadi had been killed in Deir al-Zour Province. Neither report could be independently confirmed, and United States officials immediately cast doubt on their credibility. Despite the doubts cast on those reports, rumors of Baghdadi’s death continued to swirl. More important than the content of the audio is the fact that it served as a “proof-of-life message,” said Seamus Hughes, the deputy director of George Washington University’s Program on Extremism. The Islamic State has been steadily losing territory since 2015. This year, it lost the city of Mosul, where it controlled a population of approximately one million people; the nearby town of Tal Afar, Iraq; and part of Raqqa. Despite these setbacks, the group continues to be a fierce and nimble foe. The battle for Mosul, which President Barack Obama’s administration had hoped to conclude before he left office in January, grew into a bloody nine-month slog, with entire neighborhoods obliterated in an effort to kill the remaining fighters. It came at a steep price to Iraq’s military, which lost more than 700 troops in the battle. Even as the group has lost territory in one part of its caliphate, it has retaken areas that were declared liberated and pushed into new parts of the world. In recent weeks, new Islamic State checkpoints have emerged in Libya, and the group continues to hold parts of the city of Marawi, in the Philippines, despite a four-month-long siege by the country’s military. The Islamic State staged a counterassault this week in Ramadi, Iraq, a town liberated by the Iraqis in 2015. In neighboring Syria on Thursday, the group’s fighters assaulted a position south of the city of Deir al-Zour, putting a dent in recent gains by the government. The group has also continued to remotely guide and inspire its sympathizers to carry out both small-scale and devastating attacks in Europe, with cells of people who had never traveled to Syria behind some of the worst violence, including in Britain and Spain. Sounding a defiant tone, Mr. Baghdadi ridiculed the coalition forces who are battling the group with American help, saying they “wouldn’t stand one hour of fighting without Crusader air support.” Mr. Baghdadi ended his speech by vowing to continue fighting, including calling for attacks on “disbeliever media centers.” Although the recording’s authenticity could not be immediately confirmed, the voice on the tape sounds the same as that of other recordings of Mr. Baghdadi. The Islamic State has not misrepresented a recording of its leader in the past, and the Pentagon said it had “no reason to believe the tape is not authentic.”
How to secure home docks ahead of Hurricane Irma  [SEP]  WINTER HAVEN, Fla. (WFLA) – There’s worry in Polk County that docks could be broken up by strong winds from Hurricane Irma. People in the area remember damage caused by Hurricane Charlie in 2004. That storm impacted areas around the more than 500 lakes in the county. Larry Gohn, owner of Larry Gohn Marine Construction says cross bracing, sometimes called “X” bracing is a good solution for securing your dock. Gohn says doing it this way could lower the chance of your dock breaking apart, preventing pieces of wood from becoming projectiles. Larry Covre owns a vacation home in along Lake Howard in Winter Haven. He came back down from Canada to secure his home and dock. “When the wind gets blowing, the waves get crashing into the dock and there may not be enough support in the structure of the dock, so it doesn’t hurt to put some cross-bracing in to reinforce it,” Covre says. Gohn says there’s still time to make adjustments to your dock or hire a company to get the work done before a possible impact by Hurricane Irma. • The latest on Hurricane Irma from Storm Team 8 • Where to get sandbags in the Tampa Bay area • How to get water even if the stores are out • The one thing you must do for your pet as Irma approaches • Orlando Intl.

Belgian authorities admit two-year-old girl was shot in the face by police  [SEP]  The authorities in Belgium have admitted that a two-year-old girl who died after police opened fire on a van carrying migrants near Mons on Thursday was shot in the face. Prosecutors had initially denied the account given to the Guardian by relatives of the girl, called Mawda, suggesting instead that she had been taken ill or died as a result of erratic driving. The child was killed after a police patrol followed and intercepted a van containing 26 adults and four children, including Mawda, on a highway near the city of Mons in the early hours of Thursday morning. She was travelling with her Kurdish-Iraqi parents and three-year-old brother. A source told the Guardian that police opened fire in an effort to stop the vehicle, which was being driven by alleged people smugglers to a lorry park on the coast. From there, the refugees were to be smuggled onboard lorries destined for the UK. However, a source had told the Guardian that police opened fire on the van in an effort to force it to stop. A bullet is alleged to have penetrated the vehicle and hit the girl in the cheek. Following the gunfire, it is understood that officers surrounded the vehicle in a 45-minute standoff as they assessed the situation. Upon opening the doors of the van, the child’s mother screamed for help. An ambulance was called and took the child to a Mons hospital, where she was pronounced dead. It is believed, however, that Mawda died at the scene. Frédéric Bariseau, a spokesman for the Tournai prosecutor’s office, confirmed on Friday afternoon that Mawda died as a result of a gunshot injury, but said he could not confirm the provenance of the bullet. “The autopsy determined that the cause of death was a bullet that entered the cheek,” said Bariseau. “I want to be careful about saying that the bullet could be of police origin. We have to assess the evidence. “Police have opened an internal investigation to determine the circumstances of the girl’s death.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest The family of German-born Mawda have been placed in accommodation in Belgium. Photograph: Handout In a statement released on Thursday, Bariseau had denied reports that the girl had been shot. “The little girl did not die as a result of police gunfire,” he said, suggesting several possible causes including illness, an accident inside the van caused by the driver’s behaviour, or a blow to the head. Jan Jambon, Belgium’s interior minister, wrote on Twitter: “[a] tragic event with dramatic consequences. The investigation is ongoing.” A source close to the family told the Guardian: “The family are worried that their daughter’s death will be covered up with no one being held to account. They have been told by the authorities that Mawda will be buried on Tuesday. “Her family have been placed in accommodation in Belgium. However, they have been told that they have to decide whether they are seeking asylum in Belgium. They have until tomorrow to make up their minds, failing which they have to leave and might possibly be deported back to Germany, but this is unclear. “Either way, authorities have stated that once they have ‘legally settled in a country’ they can claim Mawda’s body and have it transferred.” The source alleged that the family had previously been smuggled to the UK but was deported to Germany last year by UK authorities since Mawda was born there, and is therefore a German national. Two-year-old girl dies after incident involving armed police in Belgium Read more Zakia Khattabi, co-leader of the Belgian Green party, Mawda’s death was the result of an “increasingly repressive” migration policy. “I want to extend our sympathy to the victim and the victim’s family,” she said. “But after emotion comes anger. We demand that the spotlight is put on this case and that political responsibilities are taken.” Belgium’s federal government has been criticised for its increasingly tough stance on migrants. Theo Francken, the country’s immigration minister, said last year that Europe must turn back boats carrying would-be migrants across the Mediterranean. “Taking a ticket on a smuggler boat does not give you free entrance into the European continent,” said Francken, a member of the Flemish separatist N-VA, the largest party in the governing coalition. Earlier this year, Francken drew criticism for deporting Sudanese migrants, several of whom later said they were tortured after being returned home.
Peru court overturns pardon of ex-leader Fujimori  [SEP]  LIMA, Peru (AP) — Peru's Supreme Court has overturned a medical pardon for former strongman Alberto Fujimori and ordered he be returned to jail. Former President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski pardoned Fujimori on humanitarian grounds last Christmas Eve in what many saw as an attempt to stave off impeachment by courting favor with Fujimori's allies in Congress. But the high court ruled Wednesday the pardon was unlawful. Magistrates immediately ordered the 80-year-old Fujimori be captured so he can serve out the remainder of a 25-year sentence for his role in the killing of 25 people during his decade-long rule that ended in 2000. Some Peruvians credit Fujimori with defeating the nation's Maoist guerrillas, but others condemn him for permitting human rights abuses.
North Korea using ‘Fire and Fury’ to attack Donald Trump  [SEP]  SEOUL, Korea, Republic Of – North Korea has found good material to attack U.S. President Donald Trump: Michael Wolff’s bombshell new book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.” The book paints Trump as a leader who doesn’t understand the weight of his office and whose competence is questioned by aides. Trump and other White House aides have blasted it as inaccurate trash. But it was the top-selling book in the U.S. last week, and its numbers are likely to grow far higher. On Thursday, the North’s main Rodong Sinmun newspaper, run by its ruling Workers’ Party, carried an article about the book’s subject matter, how Trump reacted and why it is selling so well. READ MORE: Here are some of the things we have learned from Michael Wolff’s ‘Fire and Fury’ book Its sales reflect “rapidly surging anti-Trump sentiments in the international community,” the article said. “The anti-Trump book is sweeping all over the world so Trump is being massively humiliated worldwide.” The book’s popularity “foretells Trump’s political demise,” the article said. WATCH: People close to Donald Trump consider him a ‘moron’ who acts ‘like a child,’ author says Last summer, Trump threatened North Korea with “fire and fury like the world has never seen” in an exchange of taunts with the North, which claimed it was examining plans to launch missiles toward the American territory of Guam. Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have since traded threats of war and crude insults, as the North conducted nuclear and long-range missile tests. Trump called Kim “Rocket Man” on a “suicide mission.” Kim called the 71-year-old American president “the mentally deranged U.S. dotard.” In his New Year’s address last week, Kim said he has a “nuclear button” that could fire weapons anywhere in the United States, and Trump responded that he has a much bigger and more powerful “nuclear button.” READ MORE: Donald Trump open to North Korea talks at ‘appropriate time’ Recently, North Korea has taken steps toward improving ties with rival South Korea in what critics call a tactic to divide Seoul and Washington and weaken U.S.-led international pressure and sanctions on the country. On Tuesday, it had its first formal talks with South Korea in about two years and agreed to send a delegation to next month’s Winter Olympics in the South and hold military talks aimed at easing front-line animosity. WATCH: Trump says Michael Wolff never interviewed him, blames ‘Sloppy’ Steve Bannon for book’s content But North Korea hasn’t stopped its rhetoric against Trump. Last week, the North’s state media called Trump a “war maniac” and “madman.” After Tuesday’s inter-Korean talks, Trump said during a phone conversation with South Korean President Moon Jae-in that the United States was open to talks with North Korea “at the appropriate time, under the right circumstances,” according to a White House statement. “Fire and Fury” was released last Friday and sold 29,000 copies through Saturday, NPD BookScan told The Associated Press. Digital sales already top 250,000 and audio sales exceed 100,000, according to John Sargent, CEO of Macmillan, the parent company of the book’s publisher, Henry Holt and Co. It has raised an initial announced printing of 150,000 to more than 1 million.
Thousands flee Iraq's Mosul as battle edges into Old City  [SEP]  Five months into the battle to take Islamic State's last bastion in Iraq, government forces have cleared the east and half of western Mosul, and are now focused on controlling the Old City as well as the strategic al-Nuri Mosque. As fighting has entered into the narrow alleyways and densely populated parts of the west, more residents are fleeing liberated areas where food and water are scarce, security fragile and where homes are often caught in shelling. "We have been trapped for 25 days. No water, no food, everyone will die and they will have to pull us from the rubble," said one resident of Bab Jdid district, not giving his name because relatives remained inside Mosul. Families with elderly relatives and children marched through western Mosul's muddy streets, past buildings pock-marked by bullet and bombs. Some said they had hardly eaten in weeks, scrambling for supplies handed out by a local aid agency. "It is terrible, Islamic State have destroyed us. There is no food, no bread. There is absolutely nothing," said another resident. As many as 600,000 civilians may be caught inside the city with the militants. Iraqi forces cut off Mosul from the remaining territory that Islamic State controls in Iraq and Syria. But even in liberated areas, many prefer to leave the city amid heavy fighting. Around 255,000 people have been displaced from Mosul and surrounding areas since October, including more than 100,000 since the latest military campaign in western Mosul began on Feb. 19, according to United Nations figures. The last week has seen the highest level of displacement yet, with 32,000 displaced between March 12 and 15. Heavy rains and clouds this week restricted air cover and helicopters, slowing the advance of Federal Police and Rapid Response forces who are consolidating positions around the Old City and the al-Nuri Mosque. "The weather is cloudy and rainy but our forces are advancing toward their targets," Federal Police Major General Haider Dhirgham told reporters at the forward base inside Mosul. "In a few steps and strikes we will reach the Nuri mosque." As militants retreat into the confined streets of the Old City, Islamic State has been resisting with snipers, mortars and the armored suicide car bombs that plow into army positions. The fall of Mosul would be a significant blow to Islamic State, whose leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi used the al-Nuri mosque to declare a self-proclaimed caliphate spanning Iraq and Syria in 2014. U.S. officials have estimated that around 2,000 fighters remain inside the city. But even after the liberation of Mosul, there are risks that militants will return to the kind of guerrilla warfare and bombings they have used in the past.
Syrian forces battle ISIS, recapture historic town of Palmyra  [SEP]  Syrian government forces battling the militant Islamic State (ISIS) group re-entered Palmyra on Thursday in their quest to again take the historic town they had lost to the militants in December, state media reported. The SANA news agency reported that government troops entered the town's archaeological site, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, around mid-day, then the town itself, as ISIS militants fled the area. The Syrian government's push has relied on the support from Lebanon's Hezbollah group and Russian air cover, according to Hezbollah's media outlets. ISIS defenses had begun to crumble on Sunday, with the government troops reaching the town's outskirts on Tuesday. Activist-run Palmyra News Network said the advancing forces pounded the desert town famed for its ancient Roman monuments and grand stone theater with artillery and airstrikes during the day. This is the government's second campaign to retake the desert town. It seized Palmyra from ISIS militants last March only to lose it again 10 months later. Before the civil war gripped Syria in 2011, Palmyra was a top tourist attraction, drawing tens of thousands of visitors each year. The town, according to Mohammed Homsi, the director of the activist-run Palmyra News Network, is almost entirely deserted. Islamic State fighters reportedly evacuated the last of their relatives on Sunday, he said. Archeologists have decried what they say is extensive damage to its ruins. Drone footage released by Russia's Defense Ministry earlier this month showed new damage to the facade of Palmyra's Roman-era theater and the adjoining Tetrapylon a set of four monuments with four columns each at the center of the colonnaded road leading to the theater. A 2014 report by a UN research agency disclosed satellite evidence of looting while the ruins were under Syrian military control. Opposition factions have also admitted to looting the antiquities for funds. The ISIS group has twice used the town's Roman theater as a stage for mass killings, most recently in January, when they shot and beheaded a number of captives they said had tried to escape their December advance. Other ISIS killings were said to have taken place in the courtyard of the Palmyra museum and in a former Russian base in the town. The developments in Palmyra came against the backdrop of Syrian peace talks which are underway in Geneva but without any tangible breakthroughs so far. Diplomats and negotiators have set their sights on modest achievements in the latest round of negotiations, after a week of discussions centering on setting an agenda for future talks. On Thursday, UN Special Envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura is due for another round of meetings with both the government delegation and opposition groups. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov told reporters Wednesday that “the parties have agreed to ... discuss all issues in a parallel way, on several tracks.” After a Damascus request, the issue of terrorism is also on the table, he had said. Russia is a key sponsor of Syrian President Bashar Assad's government in Damascus. A top Syrian opposition negotiator, Nasr al-Hariri, said the talks would likely culminate in a closing ceremony on Friday and the parties may be back in Geneva for further discussions in a few weeks. Setting the agenda and strategy to guide discussions has proven difficult as the main conflicting parties dig in their heels over form and semantics. In Turkey, the country's foreign minister said that with the completion of an operation to retake the ISIS-held town of al-Bab in northern Syria, Turkish troops will head to the Syrian town of Manbij next, to oust US-backed Syrian Kurdish forces that Ankara views as terrorists and a threat to Turkey. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Thursday that Turkey would not shy away from attacking the Kurdish group that dominates the Syria Democratic Forces, which captured Manbij last year after weeks of deadly fighting with ISIS. He renewed calls for the new US administration not to support the Kurdish forces. Cavusoglu stressed that an operation to take Manbij had not started yet, but acknowledged that skirmishes between Turkish-backed forces and the Kurdish fighters may have occurred. That front line in northern Syria was further complicated by a concurrent announcement by the Syrian Kurdish side on Thursday that they had agreed with Russia to withdraw from some of the territory between al-Bab and Manbij to make room for a buffer. The Manbij Military Council, part of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, said that under the deal, they will withdraw from a front line as the rival Turkish-backed forces near the Euphrates River. This will allow Syrian government forces to create a buffer between them. However, Cavusoglu denied any such agreement was reached, and the Turkish and Syrian authorities have long regarded each other with thinly-veiled hostility. There was no immediate comment from the Syrian government.
Police gun down 5 armed robbers on Tema Motorway  [SEP]  The Police Command have stated that they gunned down five (5) suspected armed robbers on the Accra end of the motorway. “The police strategized comprehensively to thwart this agenda and mounted surveillance on the suspects, who were on board two saloon vehicles and a bus,” the Accra Regional Police Commander, DCOP George Alex Mensah told the media on Thursday morning. The police acted based on intelligence that some robbers have planned to go on rampage in that area. READ ALSO: Six notorious armed robbers arrested in Sege “The team tried to get the vehicles to pull over but the suspects, seeing the police, started firing indiscriminately into the police surveillance car narrowly missing the policemen on board. The [police] team was then reinforced and engaged the suspects in the shootout,” he explained. All kinds of weapons and some talismans were also retrieved from them. DCOP Mensah also said, “These robbers are suspected to be connected with several robberies within the metropolis, especially the recent attacks and robberies on forex bureaux and the Adenta robberies we all know about".
Pruitt's EPA replacement won't be any better for the environment, green groups say  [SEP]  Green groups cheered the resignation Thursday of Scott Pruitt, saying the Environmental Protection Agency administrator’s multiple ethical lapses and pro-polluter tilt made him unsuitable for the nation’s highest environmental post. But the activists doubted that the departure, announced by President Trump via Twitter, would change the administration's policies. The EPA will now be led by an interim chief, Andrew Wheeler, who was a coal industry lobbyist before he was confirmed as Pruitt's deputy in April. Pruitt’s tenure was marked by more than a dozen investigations into alleged conflicts of interest and controversial spending of taxpayer funds — ranging from his use of an outsized security detail, to his scheduling of numerous expensive foreign trips, to his acceptance of what appeared to be a below-market condominium rental connected to a lobbyist. Pruitt's time at the helm of the EPA was also defined by an aggressive push to undo President Barack Obama's environmental legacy. He took aim at Obama-era regulations that sought to curb toxic pollution and carbon emissions, expressed doubt about climate science, and even championed fossil fuels and coal — moves that troubled environmentalists. Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, deemed Pruitt "the worst head of the agency in its 48-year history." "He will forever be associated with extraordinary ethical corruption and the abuse of power for petty personal enrichments," Cook said in a statement. "Sadly, the ideological fervor with which Pruitt pursued the destruction of environmental regulations and the agency itself live on in the Trump administration." The Sierra Club seconded the notion that Pruitt was the worst EPA boss ever. The group's executive director, Michael Brune, added of Trump: "Any president that cared about protecting taxpayers, respecting science, tackling the climate crisis, or protecting the environment would have fired him months ago. " Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, also bashed the outgoing official. "Ethics matter. So does a commitment to EPA’s central mission," Suh said in a statement. "Pruitt failed miserably on both counts. If his successor also puts the interests of polluters ahead of protecting public health, he or she will encounter the same wall of resistance — and meet the same fate." A spokesperson for the EPA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump has for months stood by Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general. The president said as recently as June that the EPA chief was "doing really, really well."
Yulia Skripal says her 'strength is growing daily', in first statement since Salisbury poisoning  [SEP]  Police in protective suits at The Maltings shopping centre following the nerve agent attack Police in protective suits at The Maltings shopping centre following the nerve agent attack UK POISONING VICTIM Yulia Skripal has said her “strength is growing daily”, as she released her first statement since the Salisbury nerve agent attack. Yulia Skripal and her father, ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal, have been in hospital since last month after being found unconscious on a bench in the English town of Salisbury. The Skripals were poisoned by a nerve agent. In a statement issued by London’s Met Police this afternoon, Yulia Skripal said: “I woke up over a week ago now and am glad to see my strength is growing daily.” She said she is grateful for the interest in her wellbeing and for the messages of goodwill that she has received. “I have many people to thank for my recovery and would especially like to mention the people of Salisbury that came to my aid when my father and I were incapacitated,” Skripal said. “Further than that, I would like to thank the staff at Salisbury District Hospital for their care and professionalism,” she added. Yulia Skripal did not comment on the current condition of her father. The UK has blamed Russia for the poisoning, expelling diplomats in retaliation. Allies of the UK, Ireland among them, have followed suit in expelling Russian diplomats. In response, the Kremlin has said it would be expelling an equal number of British diplomats. It has persistently denied involvement in the poisoning. In a press conference this afternoon, Russian Ambassador Alexander Yakovenko said that Russia wanted full cooperation with Britain on the investigation into the nerve agent attack. When asked whether Russia will ensure that British police have access to any Russian suspects, Yakovenko said that if there are any suspects, Russia is ready to co-operate.
US Senate confirms Powell as next Fed chairman  [SEP]  WASHINGTON, D.C.: The US Senate on Tuesday confirmed former investment banker Jerome Powell as head of the Federal Reserve, putting President Donald Trump’s pick in a role of enormous influence over the world’s largest economy. Powell, a current Fed governor, was confirmed by a vote of 85-12, paving the way for him to replace current Chair Janet Yellen when she steps down next month. In choosing to replace Yellen, Trump dismantled another piece of his predecessor Barack Obama’s legacy, making Trump the first US president in nearly 40 years not to reappoint the incumbent Fed chair. Analysts say Powell’s appointment offered Trump the chance both to remove an Obama appointee, while also signaling to markets that he favored continuity with the slow and deliberate rate increases that had won Yellen plaudits at the end of her term. In addition to being a Democrat and the first female chief of the US central bank, Yellen was also a defender of the regulations enacted following the financial crisis—putting her at odds with the current White House’s deregulation agenda. Powell, 64, had already been through the Senate confirmation process before becoming a Fed governor in 2012. Since then, he has never dissented from any of the central bank’s monetary decisions. During a drawn out search process, Powell emerged as a centrist, consensus candidate—a Republican unlikely to raise rates too quickly but amenable to loosening financial regulations in ways long sought by Wall Street. In promoting Powell to the Fed leadership, Trump takes another step toward remolding the central bank in his image, with four vacancies on the Fed’s board of governors yet to be filled. In November, Trump also nominated university professor and conservative economist Marvin Goodfriend to fill one of the vacancies. Goodfriend appeared Tuesday for Senate confirmation hearings, where lawmakers grilled him about predictions—which were never borne out—that Fed stimulus following the 2008 financial meltdown would drive up inflation without aiding the economic recovery. Yellen has led the central bank since 2014 and will relinquish the leadership post just as the US economic recovery is cresting, having overseen falling unemployment, robust growth and low inflation—conditions that have won her praise from many, including Trump.
At least 7 dead in suicide bombing in Somalia's Baidoa  [SEP]  NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — A suicide bomber detonated in the middle of a restaurant in the Somali town of Baidoa, leaving at least seven people dead, police said Saturday. At least nine people were wounded in a second blast when a grenade struck a Baidoa hotel, Col. Ahmed Muse told The Associated Press. Baidoa is a key economic center about 250 kilometers (155 miles) west of the capital, Mogadishu, and about the same distance east of the Ethiopian border. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blasts. The al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab extremist group, which controlled Baidoa between 2009 and 2012 before being driven out by Ethiopian-backed government forces, still holds parts of southern and central Somalia. The blasts came a day before Somalia marks the first anniversary of the deadliest attack in its history, a truck bombing that killed more than 500 people in Mogadishu. Attention in recent days has turned to Baidoa, the interim capital of South West state, as high-level al-Shabab defector Mukhtar Robow seeks the regional presidency. Robow is the highest-ranking official to have ever quit al-Shabab, surrendering to the Somali government last year after the United States cancelled a $5 million reward offered for his capture. Somalia’s government earlier this month said Robow was not eligible to run for the regional post because he is still under U.S. sanctions that were imposed against him in 2008 when he was identified as a “specially designated global terrorist.” Robow is among several candidates challenging former Somali parliament speaker and incumbent regional president Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden. The election is Nov. 17.
Amateur astronomer discovers NASA satellite that’s been lost for 12 years  [SEP]  (CNN) — For 12 years, a NASA satellite called IMAGE was lost in space. NASA scientists hadn’t heard from the satellite since 2005, after it abruptly stopped responding. But earlier this month, an amateur astronomer happened to be searching for traces of the secretive Zuma mission launched by SpaceX when he stumbled onto something entirely different: signals from a satellite that was not accounted for. Scott Tilley, who is based in Canada, then matched the signal to a NASA spacecraft and theorized that it was the long-lost satellite IMAGE. He blogged and tweeted about his findings. He also reached out to the principal investigator who had been responsible for the satellite’s mission, according to Tilley’s blog. NASA set off to investigate and trained its Deep Space Network, a constellation of radio telescopes used to communicate with space missions, to search for the satellite. Five separate antennas then confirmed the signal and matched the satellite’s identity. On Tuesday, NASA confirmed that the re-discovered satellite is indeed IMAGE. And the space agency also had some unexpected news. “The NASA team has been able to read some basic housekeeping data from the spacecraft, suggesting that at least the main control system is operational,” according to NASA’s statement. IMAGE launched in March 25, 2000. It was designed to study the Earth’s magnetosphere — the magnetic field that shields the Earth. It was hailed as a success, helping map out the Earth’s magnetic field in detail and resulted in 37 unique scientific discoveries, according its final report. It successfully completed its initial scheduled mission — originally slated for two years — and had been in its extended phase when the satellite stopped routine contact on December 18, 2005. NASA tried to regain control of the satellite, but it ultimately concluded that the spacecraft likely suffered an event that disabled its power supply and wasn’t able to recover. The mission had been declared over in 2007. After IMAGE was lost, its original software and databases needed to operate the satellite had been decommissioned. NASA said that it will now attempt to adapt the software to its more modern systems. “Scientists and engineers at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, will continue to try to analyze the data from the spacecraft to learn more about the state of the spacecraft,” NASA said. After the confirmation, Tilley wrote on his blog: “Welcome back IMAGE! Serve us well again…” He told the CBC: “As somebody who’s loved space since being a kid, I’m happy to have contributed something positive.”
Olympics-Diplomacy under microscope as  [SEP]  PYEONGCHANG, South Korea, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The Winter Olympics sparked to life in a vivid, colourful ceremony of fire and ice in South Korea on Friday, and the diplomacy was just as choreographed in the stadium where leaders from nations that are sworn enemies sat close together. South Korea, which is using the Pyeongchang Games to break the ice with North Korea, seated its president alongside U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, with two of the North’s most senior officials sitting in the row behind. President Moon Jae-in, who wants to harness the Olympic spirit to pave the way for talks over the North’s nuclear and missile programme, shook hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s sister as well as the North’s nominal head of state. The South is still technically at war with the North after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, and the United States and the North have recently swapped nuclear threats. Underlining Moon’s efforts to re-engage with the North, the opening ceremony followed the story line of children wandering through a mythical, snowy landscape and discovering a world where people live in peace and harmony. The Olympics have provided some respite from years of tense relations between Seoul and Pyongyang, though just hours before the ceremony hundreds of anti-North Korean protesters scuffled with riot police outside the stadium, burning North Korean flags and pictures of its leader, Kim Jong Un. South Korea’s frigid February, where temperatures have plummeted to minus 20 degrees Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit) at night, has come as a shock to the system for athletes and visitors alike in the leadup to these Games, prompting concerns about hypothermia at the opening ceremony. The weather was a little milder than forecast on Friday, but spectators still huddled near heaters, holding hot packs and slurping down steaming fishcake soup to ward off the chills. Bundled up in a scarf, mask and knitted hat, with hot packs tucked into her knee blanket, office worker Shin Hye-sook said she and her three colleagues were coping with the cold. “It’s okay unless the wind blows,” said the 60-year-old. “We’re sitting as close as we can and trying not to move a lot to save our energy.” (Writing by Peter Rutherford, Additional reporting by James Pearson, Hyunjoo Jin and Jane Chung; Editing by Mark Bendeich)
Italy asks Malta to take in, seize migrant rescue ship  [SEP]  ROME (Reuters) - Italy on Friday urged Malta to take in a ship carrying more than 200 rescued migrants as the new government pressures European partners to shoulder more of the burden of immigration from North Africa. The Dutch-flagged ship run by the German charity Mission Lifeline was seeking a nearby European dock, a day after anti-immigrant Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said the vessel should take the migrants to the Netherlands. Earlier this month, Salvini pledged to no longer let charity ships bring rescued migrants to Italy, leaving the Gibraltar-flagged Aquarius stranded at sea for days with more than 600 migrants on board until Spain offered them safe haven. Malta also refused to take in the Aquarius. “For the safety of the crew and those rescued we humanly and politically ask Malta to finally open one of its ports, and then seize the ship and its crew,” Salvini said in Siena, Italy. Malta, a small island nation, has not taken in large numbers of people rescued at sea, while Italy has seen 650,000 arrivals since 2014. On Friday, Malta had not received a call for help from the ship, Lifeline, or from Italy’s coastguard, Maltese government sources said. Lifeline was sailing about half way between Tripoli and Malta early on Friday. “Malta cannot back out,” Transport Minister Danilo Toninelli, who oversees the coastguard, said. The European Union’s border control agency Frontex “will make an official request to Malta to open its ports”, he said. On Thursday, Toninelli said the Italian coastguard would pick up the 224 migrants, including 14 women and four small children, from Lifeline because it was too dangerous for the 32-metre vessel to travel to the Netherlands with so many on board. He said the coastguard would escort Lifeline to an Italian port, where it would be impounded pending an investigation into its flag status after the Dutch government denied responsibility for the vessel. “There is no need for the Italian government to seize the ship for investigations,” spokesman Axel Steier said in a statement. “No port of safety was assigned so far,” Steier added. “We call out to the European community, might it be on national or local level, to help find a solution.” While the number of sea arrivals to Italy has dropped dramatically this year - more than 77 percent from last year - the new government has thrust immigration to the top of the EU’s agenda ahead of a summit of leaders next week. Italy’s government, sworn in earlier this month after promising to raise its voice on immigration in Brussels, has sparred with France, Malta and Germany ahead of the meeting. An SWG poll this week showed two-thirds of Italians agree humanitarian boats should not be allowed in the country’s ports. But off the Libyan coast, where people smugglers operate with impunity, the U.N. refugee agency said an estimated 220 migrants drowned this week. The death toll in the central Mediterranean this year is nearing 1,000, the UNHCR said.
Olympics: Bolt loses gold as IOC strip Jamaica of 2008 relay win  [SEP]  [LAUSANNE] Usain Bolt lost one of his nine Olympic gold medals Wednesday when the International Olympic Committee stripped Jamaica of their 4x100m relay win at the 2008 Beijing Games after Nesta Carter was caught doping. The decision which follows the retesting of hundreds of samples from the Beijing event, means that Bolt, as Carter's teammate, loses one of the three gold medals he won at that Olympics. Carter was found to have tested positive for banned substance Methylhexanamine, which was once used in nasal decongestants but now is more commonly found as an ingredient in dietary supplements. The loss of the relay gold deprives Bolt of one of his 'triple triples' - he won gold in the 100m, 200 and the 4x100m at Beijing and then went on to repeat the feat in London in 2012 and again in Rio last year. The IOC said in a statement that in the case of Carter, 31, re-analysis of his 2008 samples "resulted in a positive test for the prohibited substance methylhexaneamine." The IOC Disciplinary Commission ruled that Carter "is found to have committed an anti-doping rule violation pursuant to the IOC Anti-Doping Rules applicable to the Games of the XXIX Olympiad in Beijing in 2008." As such, he "is disqualified from the men's 4x100m relay event" and must return his medal while the team is likewise disqualified and must hand back their medals. The IOC said that Russia's Tatiana Lebedeva, who won silver in the women's triple jump event and long jump, had also been disqualified following re-analysis of her samples which showed up positive for dehydrochlormethyltestosterone (turinabol), a substance on the world body's banned list.
Latest: Five people shot dead at Fort Lauderdale Airport in Florida  [SEP]  Update at 7.30pm: Five people are dead and another eight are wounded in a shooting at Fort Lauderdale international airport, Florida, said the Sheriff's office. A shooting victim is taken into Broward Health Trauma Center in Fort Lauderdale Update at 6.30pm: Multiple people have been shot at Fort Lauderdale international airport, according to reports. On its official Twitter account, airport officials said there was an "ongoing incident" in the Terminal 2 baggage claim area. They did not elaborate. Miami area television stations are reporting that at least nine people were shot and that the shooter is in custody. News helicopters hovering over the scene showed hundreds of people standing on the tarmac as an ambulance drove by and numerous law enforcement officers rushed to the scene. Former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer tweeted that he was at the airport when shots were fired and "everyone is running". Calls to the Broward Sheriff's Office and the Fort Lauderdale Police Department were not immediately returned.
The Latest: Israel welcomes southern Syria cease-fire  [SEP]  BEIRUT — The Latest on the conflict in Syria (all times local): Israel says it would “welcome a genuine cease-fire” in southern Syria so long as it doesn’t enable a military presence for Iran and its proxies along Israel’s border. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s comments were Israel’s first since the cease-fire brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin went into effect midday Sunday. Israel has repeatedly said it will not allow Iran, which is a close ally of the Syrian government, to set up a permanent presence in Syria. It has carried out a number of airstrikes in Syria against suspected shipments of “game-changing” weapons bound for Hezbollah in Lebanon. Netanyahu says he conveyed his country’s concerns once again last week to both Putin and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Netanyahu says both said they understand Israel’s position and took it into account. An open-ended cease-fire in southern Syria brokered by the United States and Russia has come into effect. The cease-fire, announced after a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hamburg last week, is the first initiative by the Trump administration in collaboration with Russia to bring some stability to war-torn Syria. No cease-fire has lasted long in the six-year-old Syrian war. U.S.-backed rebels, Syrian government forces, and Islamic State militants are all fighting for control of southern Syria. The latest truce, which began at noon (0900 GMT) Saturday, is intended to allay concerns of neighbouring Israel and Jordan about Iranian-backed and government-allied forces at their borders. The truce does not include the IS group.
Southern China karaoke lounge fire kills 18 - police  [SEP]  HONG KONG (Reuters) - A fire in southern China at a karaoke TV lounge killed 18 people on Tuesday, according to the official Xinhua news agency, citing local police. The blaze occurred in Qingyuan city in Guangdong province, around an hour's drive from the provincial capital of Guangzhou. According to the official weibo account of police in Qingyuan, the blaze started just after midnight in a three storey building. The police said it was initially believed the fire was started intentionally by someone and an investigation was now underway. The report gave no further details. [https://bit.ly/2qVO3ix] The Qingyuan police said five people were injured. Beijing's municipal government launched a 40-day "special operation" targeting fire code and building safety violations after an apartment fire in the Chinese capital last November killed 19 people, almost all of them migrants.
Ex-Israeli 'NSA' chief: Energy should be first cyber target in Iran war  [SEP]  The former head of Israel's 'NSA,' Ehud Schnerosen said on Sunday that the first cyber target in any future conflict with Iran and Hezbollah should be their energy infrastructure. Speaking at a major cyber conference taking place in Israel, Schnerosen referred to the energy sector as a "major pillar economy, state's cardio-vascular system." "We should not attack water, food, healthcare on ethical grounds, and should not attack banks because of the potential butterfly effect," said Schnerosen. "The next 9/11 in cyber will be energy sector."
Even Eyelashes Freeze as Russia Sees Temperatures Hit Minus 67 C | Chiang Rai Times English Language Newspaper  [SEP]  Even Eyelashes Freeze as Russia Sees Temperatures Hit Minus 67 C MOSCOW – Even thermometers can’t keep up with the plunging temperatures in Russia’s remote Yakutia region, which hit minus 67 degrees Celsius (minus 88.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in some areas Tuesday. In Yakutia — a region of 1 million people about 3,300 miles (5,300 kilometers) east of Moscow — students routinely go to school even in minus 40 degrees. But school was cancelled Tuesday throughout the region and police ordered parents to keep their children inside. In the village of Oymyakon, one of the coldest inhabited places on earth, state-owned Russian television showed the mercury falling to the bottom of a thermometer that was only set up to measure down to minus 50 degrees. In 2013, Oymyakon recorded an all-time low of minus 71 degrees Celsius (minus 98 Fahrenheit). Over the weekend, two men froze to death when they tried to walk to a nearby farm after their car broke down. Three other men with them survived because they were wearing warmer clothes, investigators reported. But the press office for Yakutia’s governor said Tuesday that all households and businesses in the region have working central heating and access to backup power generators. Residents of Yakutia are no strangers to cold weather and this week’s cold spell was not even dominating local news headlines Tuesday. But some media outlets published cold-weather selfies and stories about stunts in the extreme cold. Women posted pictures of their frozen eyelashes, while YakutiaMedia published a picture of Chinese students who got undressed to take a plunge in a thermal spring.
Officials slam photo-snapping fans after marathon collapse  [SEP]  Commonwealth Games organisers slammed bystanders for taking pictures of stricken runner Callum Hawkins after his dramatic collapse while leading the marathon on Sunday. Officials also defended the medical response after the Scot, who was clearly unsteady and fell over twice, lay unassisted on the ground for some time before help arrived. In temperatures nudging 30 degrees Celsius on the Gold Coast, Hawkins was ahead by more than two minutes when his legs buckled and he plunged onto a kerb. LATEST UPDATE: Fallen marathon runner speaks for the first time The 25-year-old struggled to his feet to continue but was clearly in distress and shortly afterwards, with just over a mile (two kilometres) to go, he stumbled heavily into a roadside barrier, banging his head as he fell. There was an anxious wait before any assistance reached Hawkins, by which time Australia's Michael Shelley was passing the scene on his way to winning gold. Organising committee chief executive Mark Peters took issue with bystanders who were seen filming Hawkins on their phones as he lay on the ground. "I like many others was distressed to see a wonderful athlete like Callum collapse during the closing stages of today's marathon," said Peters. "I was also concerned about the behaviour of a small number of bystanders who chose to take images. This is not in keeping with the spirit of GC2018." Hawkins was taken to hospital in an ambulance, where he was sitting up and talking and not thought to be in serious danger, Team Scotand said. Medical staff with radios were posted every 500 metres along the course, the organising committee said, adding that medical help was given to Hawkins when he requested it. Under marathon rules, runners are disqualified if they accept medical aid. Peters said help arrived "within agreed response guidelines and time-frames". BBC commentator Steve Cram called the wait for medical attention "a disgrace", while TV viewers also criticised the response and the fans who took images of Hawkins. Seven of the 24 starters failed to complete the race, including Tanzania's Saidi Juma Makula, who collapsed close to the finish line before being helped into an ambulance. Another Tanzania runner, Stephano Huche Gwandu, took a tumble as he crossed the finish line and was helped into a wheelchair. After retaining his Commonwealth title, Shelley said he had also been struggling with the hot conditions. "I wasn't sure what was going on," the Australian said, about seeing Hawkins in trouble. "I had a couple of mates around Main Beach who said Callum was in a bit of trouble. They told me to keep going and gave me encouragement. "I saw him and just tried to hang on. When I was coming down the home straight I tried to accelerate but I was just gone." "I'm glad to be finished to be honest," added Shelley. "I thought hopefully I can get to the finish line because I was starting to get cramps in my hands." Shelley won the race in two hours, 16 minutes and 46 seconds with Uganda's Munyo Solomon Mutai taking silver (2:19:02) and Scotland's Robbie Simpson bronze (2:19:36). Helalia Johannes won the women's race in 2:32.40, becoming Namibia's first female gold medallist at the Commonwealth Games.
Egypt sentences 75 people to death over 2013 sit-in  [SEP]  CAIRO: Egypt sentenced to death 75 people, including prominent Islamist leaders, on Saturday over a 2013 pro-Muslim Brotherhood sit-in which ended with the killing of hundreds of protesters by security forces. Others being tried in the case, including Brotherhood spiritual leader Mohamed Badie, were handed life sentences, judicial sources said. Those being sentenced are accused of security-related offences including incitement to violence, murder and organising illegal protests. Rights groups have criticised the mass trial of more than 700 people in what has become known as the Rabaa case, after Rabaa Adawiya square where the sit-in took place in Cairo. Those sentenced to death by hanging include senior Brotherhood leaders Essam al-Erian and Mohamed Beltagi and prominent Islamist preacher Safwat Higazi, the sources said. The dispersal of the sit-in in August 2013 came weeks after President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, then military chief, ousted Islamist president Mohamed Mursi after protests against Brotherhood rule. Amnesty International says more than 800 protesters were killed. The government has said many protesters were armed, and that 43 police were killed. Since Sisi took power in 2014, authorities have justified a crackdown on dissent and freedoms as being directed at terrorists and saboteurs trying to undermine the state. Death sentences have been handed down to hundreds of his political opponents on charges such as belonging to an illegal organization or planning to carry out an attack.
T20 2018: How Chennai outsmarted Hyderabad to reach in final  [SEP]  Despite Rashid Khan (4-0-11-2) and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (3.1-0-14-1) having an economy rate under five-runs per over, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) still ended up losing to Chennai Super Kings (CSK) for the third time in this Indian Premier League yesterday. SRH coach Tom Moody's extra efforts on the eve of the match to train Carlos Braithwaite (29-ball 43) harder for the slog overs bore fruits yesterday when the 2016 World T20 final hero resurrected Sunrisers Hyderabad from a hopeless situation. SRH await Eden result SRH can still make the final as they await the winner of today's Eliminator between Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals at Eden Gardens. The Orange Army had two-time champions on the ropes before Faf du Plessis' unbeaten 67 off 42 balls and Shardul Thakur's five-ball 15 cameo helped CSK clinch a thriller as they chased down the 140-run target to win the Qualifier 1 by two wickets and enter their seventh IPL final. SRH bowlers threatened to do a repeat of what they did against Kings XI Punjab (defending 132), Royal Challengers Bangalore (defending 146) and against Mumbai Indians (defending 118 at the same venue) in this IPL after reducing CSK to 24-3 in four overs. Like CSK, Sunrisers too struck in the first over with Bhuvneshwar sending Shane Watson for a duck on the fifth ball. Siddarth Kaul then had last match's half centurion Suresh Raina and CSK's top run-getter Ambati Rayudu on consecutive balls, leaving the pacer and SRH camp pumped up. Super Rashid stuns MSD The big moment arrived when Rashid flummoxed CSK skipper MS Dhoni (9 off 18 balls) with a wrong 'un to disrupt his furniture, leaving scores of Dhoni fans stunned. When the Afghan leggie had Dwayne Bravo (7) caught at slip in his next over, SRH knew the game was as good as over with CSK reduced to 61-5 in 12 overs. With seven wickets already down before reaching the three-figure mark, CSK's last hope was Du Plessis. With 43 required off the last three overs, Du Plessis took 20 runs off Braithwaite's 18th over which included three boundaries and a six. Shardul too came to the party with two consecutive boundaries, thanks to lucky inside edges and a last-ball boundary to take 17 runs off the penultimate over bowled by Kaul. Du Plessis completed the formalities with a six off the first ball in the last over off Bhuvneshwar to kick off celebrations in the CSK camp.

It’s official! George Lucas’ museum is coming to Los Angeles  [SEP]  After initially flirting with Chicago and San Francisco as potential host cities, The Lucas Museum of Narrative Art is officially headed to Los Angeles. The announcement was made by the museum’s board of directors this week, and concludes a process that has been developing for more than two years now as the museum attempted to find a home in one of the aforementioned cities. The decision to go with Los Angeles for the $1 billion museum — which will be funded entirely by Lucas himself — comes several years after the museum was reported to be headed to Chicago, only to encounter opposition from local land preservation group Friends of the Parks. The museum’s board then entertained plans for San Francisco and Los Angeles, and the City of Angels won out in the end. More: Colin Trevorrow laughs off petition to let George Lucas helm Star Wars: Episode IX The Lucas Museum of Narrative Art is expected to house everything from paintings and sequential art to movie and television memorabilia and props, with a focus on art that tells a story in one form or another. The museum’s official mission statement reads as follows: The Lucas Museum of Narrative Art will be a gathering place to experience narrative art and the evolution of moving images — from illustration to cinema to the digital mediums of the future. The museum’s seed collection — a gift from founder George Lucas — spans a century and a half and features the images and the mediums that have profoundly shaped our cultural heritage. The foundational collection will continue to grow and evolve as the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art acquires more works. The announcement regarding the accepted development plan was accompanied by several conceptual images of the museum (looking appropriately futuristic) and a statement from the museum’s board of directors, which includes Lucas, his wife Mellody Hobson, and John Lasseter, the head of Pixar Animation Studios, and Walt Disney Animation Studios, among other notable leaders from the education, entertainment, and investment fields. Lucas’ plans to fund the creation of such a museum date back all the way back to the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by Walt Disney. After accepting the $4 billion that Disney paid for Lucasfilm and its properties, the legendary filmmaker promised to build a museum with a portion of the payout. Early plans for the museum had it opening its doors to the public in 2018, but that schedule will likely be pushed back a year or more due to the time it took to find a home for what’s likely to be a very popular destination for cinema and sci-fi fans all over the world. The official statement from the museum’s board of directors reads as follows: After extensive due diligence and deliberation, the Board of Directors of the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art is pleased to announce plans to build the museum in Exposition Park in Los Angeles. We have been humbled by the overwhelmingly positive support we received from both San Francisco and Los Angeles during our selection process. Settling on a location proved to be an extremely difficult decision precisely because of the desirability of both sites and cities. The board wishes to extend a special thanks to Mayor Ed Lee and the San Francisco Board of Supervisors for their tremendous efforts and engagement. While each location offers many unique and wonderful attributes, South Los Angeles’s Promise Zone best positions the museum to have the greatest impact on the broader community, fulfilling our goal of inspiring, engaging and educating a broad and diverse visitorship. Exposition Park is a magnet for the region and accessible from all parts of the city. As a museum uniquely focused on narrative art, we look forward to becoming part of a dynamic museum community, surrounded by more than 100 elementary and high schools, one of the country’s leading universities as well as three other world-class museums. Now we turn our attention to finalizing the details and building what we believe will be one of the most imaginative and inclusive art museums in the world—a global destination that all Angelenos and Californians will be proud to call their own More information about The Lucas Museum of Narrative Art can be found at the museum’s official website.

Cubs fans celebrate team's 1st World Series berth since 1945  [SEP]  Chicago Cubs fans waited 71 years to celebrate a return to the World Series. Overjoyed fans streamed out of Wrigley Field and into the streets Saturday night after the Cubs beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 6 of the NL Championship Series to earn their first trip to the World Series since 1945. Many people donned Cubbie blue and held "W" flags. Two people climbed a traffic pole, with one man shimmying all the way to the end. Police said he was later arrested, as were a couple of fans who lit fireworks. A majority of the crowd, however, celebrated the victory peacefully. Many took selfies in front of the stadium and hugged one another. Some also broke out in song, while others shook up beer bottles and sprayed the crowd. Police officers, including about a dozen cops on horseback, kept a close eye on the crowd. And some officers were seen giving high-fives to fans as they walked by. Brian Dusza, who was at Wrigley for Game 6 of the 2003 NLCS, never thought he'd see the team win the pennant "I never thought I'd see it," Dusza, 49, said after attending Saturday's game. "I can't even describe what I'm feeling." Among the few thousand fans who stayed in their seats an hour after the game ended was Ed Koenig of Darien. His eyes welled up as he talked about his father, who died in May. "He never got to see this," Koenig said. "I haven't been to a game this season without him and when my friend won a lottery for these tickets, I thought 'how am I going to go without my dad?'" But his friend convinced him to go. "I have his watch on," Koenig said, showing off the watch on his wrist. "I thought I was going without my dad, but I'm with him." Before the game, Steve Zucker said that if the team won, he would go to his father's grave and leave him a Cubs hat and T-shirt. "My dad died playing cards, listening to the game on a little transistor radio, so I may bring that, too," Zucker said. Cubs pitcher Kyle Hendricks said after the game that this win and trip to the World Series was for the fans. "I hope they enjoy this. They have been waiting a long time," Hendricks said. "Best fans in the baseball, most dedicated fans, and they deserve a lot more of these." The Cubs will face the Cleveland Indians in Game 1 on Tuesday, with the series returning to Wrigley Field for Game 3 on Friday.
Trump Signs New Order Stopping People From 7 Countries From Entering US  [SEP]  The United States President, Donald Trump has signed a new executive order which indefinitely halts admission of Syrian refugees and also limits the entry of other refugees into the United States. The new executive order which introduces an extreme vetting process on immigrants from the seven countries affected was signed by the US president on Friday January 27, 2017. The bill titled, “Protection Of The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,” is one of the first steps in line with the US President’s commitment to tighten border security and reduce the number of refugees entering into the country. The affected countries include; Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, according to information from a White House official. The order signed by the US president reads: “I hereby proclaim that the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any such entry.”
Rain could hinder search to find victims of Camp Fire  [SEP]  Rain could hinder search to find victims of Camp Fire CHICO, Calif. (AP) — Searchers combing a Northern California town leveled by a deadly wildfire stepped up their efforts Sunday ahead of rains forecast later this week in the fire zone where 76 bodies have been recovered so far. While the rain would help tamp down the blaze, it could also turn the area into a muddy mess and hinder efforts to find the remains of more victims in the town of Paradise. Authorities said late Saturday that 1,300 names remain on a list of people who are unaccounted for more than a week after the fire began in Butte County. Authorities stressed that the long roster does not mean they believe all those on the list are missing. Sheriff Kory Honea pleaded with evacuees to review the list of those reported as unreachable by family and friends and to call the department if those people are safe. Deputies have located hundreds of people to date, but the overall number keeps growing because they are adding more names, including those from the chaotic early hours of the disaster, Honea said. "Anytime you add a new element — rain, wind, all those kinds of things — you start disturbing things, spreading things around," Honea said Saturday. "As much as I wish that we could get through all of this before the rains come, I don't know if that's possible." Honea said it was within the "realm of possibility" that officials would never know the exact death toll from the blaze. Hundreds of search and recovery personnel from around the state are working to find remains, going to homes when they receive tips that someone might have died there. But they are also doing a more comprehensive, "door-to-door" and "car-to-car" search of areas, said Joe Moses, a commander with the Monterey County Sheriff's Office, who is helping oversee the search and rescue effort. The search area is huge, Moses said, with many structures that need to be checked. The fire also burned many places to the ground, creating a landscape unique to many search-and- rescue personnel, he said. "Here we're looking for very small parts and pieces, and so we have to be very diligent and systematic in how we do your searches," he said Friday. The remains of five more people were found Saturday, including four in Paradise and one in nearby Concow, bringing the number of dead to 76. Among them was Lolene Rios, 56, whose son Jed tearfully told KXTV in Sacramento that his mother had an "endless amount of love" for him. President Donald Trump toured the area Saturday, joined by California's outgoing and incoming governors, both Democrats who have traded sharp barbs with the Republican administration. The president also visited Southern California, where firefighters were making progress on a wildfire that tore through communities west of Los Angeles from Thousand Oaks to Malibu, killing three people. "We've never seen anything like this in California, we've never seen anything like this yet. It's like total devastation," Trump said as he stood amid the ruins of Paradise and pledged the full support of the federal government. Soon after the fire began, Trump blamed state officials for poor forest management and threatened to cut off federal funding. "He's got our back," outgoing Gov. Jerry Brown said Sunday on CBS' "Face the Nation." "There have been some back and forth between California leaders and the president," Brown said. "But in the face of tragedy, people tend to rise above some of their lesser propensities. So I think we're on a good path." He also suggested California's severe wildfires will make believers of even the most ardent climate change skeptics "in less than five years," and that those living near forests might need to build underground shelters to protect them from fires. Rain was forecast for midweek in the Paradise area. The National Weather Service said the area could get 20 mph sustained winds and 40 mph gusts, which could make it hard for crews to keep making progress against the blaze. Northern California's Camp Fire has destroyed nearly 10,000 homes and torched 233 square miles (603 square kilometers). It was 55 percent contained. Honea expressed hope that Trump's visit would help with recovery, saying the tour by the Republican president and California's Democratic leaders "signals a spirit of cooperation here that ultimately benefit this community and get us on a path toward recovery." Associated Press writers Jonathan Lemire in Paradise, California, and Janie Har and Daisy P. Nguyen in San Francisco contributed to this report.
90 suspected 'Ndrangheta mafia mobsters arrested around the world  [SEP]  Dozens of suspected mobsters thought to belong to a notorious mafia outfit have been rounded up across Europe and Latin America during a series of raids today. Some 90 alleged members of the feared 'Ndrangheta, based in southern Italy, have been arrested in a vast anti-mafia operation. Raids took place in Germany, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands as well as in some Latin American countries. In Germany the focus was on the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, which borders the Netherlands and Belgium, and Bavaria to the south. Pictures show a high-powered Harley Davidson motorbike being confiscated, garages being searched and raids taking place at an Italian restaurant and ice cream parlour. Suspects are accused of committing 'serious crimes' including activities linked to international drug trafficking, Italian police said in a statement. The 'Ndrangheta - which derives its meaning from the Greek word for 'heroism' - is made up of numerous village and family-based clans in Calabria, the rural, mountainous and under-developed 'toe' of Italy's boot. Despite intense police attention and frequent arrests, the organisation has continued to extend its reach. It has surpassed Sicily's Cosa Nostra and the Naples-based Camorra in influence thanks to its control of the cocaine trade, and is the sole mafia organisation to operate on all continents, according to anti-mafia prosecutors. Wednesday's operation came a day after Italian police arrested new Cosa Nostra boss Settimino Mineo and dozens of other suspects in Sicily in a major swoop. Jeweller Mineo, 80, was detained along with at least 45 others just before he was due to be appointed official heir to notorious mafia boss Toto Riina who died in prison last year.
Mattis in Afghanistan to Discuss War Needs  [SEP]  KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis arrived unannounced in Afghanistan on Monday to assess America’s longest war as the Trump administration weighs sending more troops. Kabul was the final stop on a six-nation, weeklong tour Mattis said was intended to bolster relations with allies and partners and to get an update on the stalemated conflict in Afghanistan. He is the first member of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet to visit Afghanistan. Gen. John Nicholson, the top American commander in Kabul, recently told Congress that he needs a few thousand more troops to keep Afghan security forces on track to eventually handling the Taliban insurgency on their own. As part of the administration’s review of Afghan policy, Trump’s national security adviser, Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, visited Kabul last week to consult with Nicholson and with Afghan officials. McMaster said in a TV interview after returning to Washington that the U.S. in recent years has scaled back its military effort against the Taliban. “Our enemy sensed that and they have redoubled their efforts, and it’s time for us, alongside our Afghan partners, to respond,” he said. Among the questions facing the administration is how to maintain pressure on a resilient Taliban and keep up counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan without prolonging a stalemate that is costing U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars a year. The war began in October 2001. The U.S. has about 9,800 troops in Afghanistan. They ended their combat mission against the Taliban in 2014 but are increasingly involved in backing up Afghan forces on the battlefield. Mattis was visiting just days after a bloody Taliban attack that killed well over 100 Afghans on a base in the country’s north. The Taliban also controls key parts of Helmand province in the south. Officials say nearly a dozen of the attackers wore army uniforms and rode in military vehicles, raising concerns of help from inside the compound. A senior American military official in Kabul said Monday that it appears likely the attack was either carried out by or planned by a Pakistan-based Taliban faction known as the Haqqani network, which is a U.S. government-designated terrorist organization. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss intelligence matters, said it likely took four to six months to plan the attack. He said it also was likely that the attackers had help in advance from Afghan troops on the base. The official said the latest Afghan estimate of 144 Afghan soldiers killed is likely to rise. Afghan officials said earlier that the country’s army chief and the defense minister resigned following the weekend Taliban attack. Two officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. The president’s official Twitter account also confirmed the resignations. In addition to the Taliban insurgency, Afghanistan also is fighting to extinguish a small but troublesome presence in Nangarhar province of militants affiliated with the Islamic State group. Two weeks ago, Nicholson created a stir by ordering an attack on an IS stronghold in Nangarhar using the military’s most powerful non-nuclear bomb, the so-called “mother of all bombs.” Mattis has declined to disclose details of damage done by that bombing, which former Afghan President Hamid Karzai has called an “atrocity.” Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

30 missing in central Italy avalanche that buries hotel  [SEP]  An avalanche buried a mountain hotel in an earthquake-hit region of central Italy, leaving at least 30 people missing, authorities said Thursday. The civil protection agency said that they were working to get rescue vehicles to the Hotel Rigopiano through roads covered in snow, joining initial rescue efforts overnight by alpine rescue teams. The ANSA news agency quoted a rescuer as saying that there were fatalities, but details weren't immediately available. Italian media said that the avalanche covered the three-story hotel in the central region of Abruzzo on Wednesday. The hotel is about 45 kilometers (30 miles) from the coastal city of Pescara. Earthquakes hit the region on Wednesday, including one with a 5.7 magnitude, but it wasn't immediately clear if the temblors triggered the avalanche. Mountain rescue teams reached the hotel by skis around 4 a.m. (0300 GMT), SKY TG24 reported. Video footage showed rescuers with shovels digging through a wall of snow, and at least one man being led through the cleared path. An ambulance was blocked several kilometers from the hotel, according to SKY. ANSA quoted rescuers as saying they have been calling out to survivors but no one has responded. The mountainous region of central Italy has been struck by a series of quakes since August that destroyed historic centers in dozens of towns and hamlets. A deadly quake in August killed nearly 300, while no one died in the strong aftershocks in October largely because population centers had already been evacuated. In the meantime, the entire region has been hit by cold weather and buffeted by snowstorms, piling more suffering on to the hard-hit population. People left homeless by the earlier quakes had been moved to hotels in the region, but it wasn't immediately clear who was staying at Hotel Rigopiano, which is located in the Gran Sasso National Park.

﻿﻿﻿Jammeh’s Defiance, ECOWAS Mistake and Buhari’s Bad Example  [SEP]  As it is now, The Gambia is under emergency rule as declared by its president of 22 years, Yahya Jammeh. The emergency rule has become necessary in the estimation of Jammeh, following his decision to challenge the outcome of the country’s December 1, 2016 election in which Adama Barrow was declared winner. The impasse has been largely fuelled by the haste with which the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has not only intervened but also interfered in what should, at this stage, be a purely internal matter of a sovereign nation. Jammeh’s decision to challenge the outcome of the election result is very well within his constitutional rights. By this, the man who is said to have ruled his country with an iron fist, is still within his constitutional rights to test the validity of the election result in the law court. Obviously, it is this right that the ECOWAS nations and indeed a good part of the world has misinterpreted to mean that Jammeh has refused to step down, and this is part of what has heightened the impasse. Just like in Nigeria, the declaration of results by the electoral body does not mark the end of an electoral process in The Gambia. The political actors are still constitutionally permitted to challenge such results in the law court. Such electoral matters can only be said to have been fully dispensed with after the highest court constitutionally empowered to deal with such matters have done so. ECOWAS will be making a grave mistake if they send in troops to The Gambia at this stage. What the regional body should be concerned with now is to send in fearless and impartial judges to that country from Nigeria as requested to dispense with the matter speedily and judiciously. It is only after the country’s highest courts have affirmed Barrow as winner and Jammeh refuse to step down and handover to Barrow that a military action would be justified. Another mistake ECOWAS made was their choice of delegation as led by President Muhammadu Buhari to The Gambia as emissaries of peace and democracy to persuade Jammeh to hand over power peacefully and as scheduled. Although Jammeh had earlier accepted defeat and promised to leave the stage on the set date of January 19, 2017, he immediately did an about-turn the moment Barrow made the hasty and politically disingenuous statement of probing Jammeh’s administration. Jammeh, who from his earlier posture, wanted to play the Goodluck Jonathan card of handing over power to the opposition after an election must have quickly remembered the Nigerian situation where persecution, injustice, oppression, deprivation and gross abuse of the rights of officials of the immediate past administration in particular and the citizens in general have been the order of the day, and recanted his earlier stance immediately. The appointment of Buhari as leader of ECOWAS delegation to The Gambia is a monumental error. How can a man with no democratic credentials lead a mission of democracy? How can a man who hardly obeys court orders as in the case of Sheikh El Zakzaky, Nnamdi Kanu et al be the one appointed to mediate in a constitutional process? Not even the orders of the same ECOWAS court on Sambo Dasuki has been obeyed by Buhari months after they were given, yet, it is the same man ECOWAS gave the enviable responsibility to convince Jammeh about the need to leave the stage a democrat! Buhari should not have been on that delegation not to talk of leading it. With the continued denial of campaign promises and policy somersaults, no leader would take Buhari’s word for whatever it is worth. With the rascally behavior of some of our security agencies under Buhari’s watch leading to many innocent citizens being killed just for exercising their rights to assemble and protest, among others, in Jammeh’s mind, Buhari’s discussion with him might just seem like a dictator talking to a dictator about the need for a peaceful transition. In fact, during those dialogues with Buhari, Jammeh might just be saying in his mind, “with your antecedents and current style of leadership, how am I sure that you would hand over power to your opponent if you were defeated in 2019?” No doubt, Buhari is not the ideal example of a democratic leader. Such a leader like him needs the intervention of proven democrats to guide him on the inalienable ingredients of democracy. So for The Gambia to pass through this phase peacefully and speedily, ECOWAS should facilitate the immediate transfer of judges from Nigeria to that country as requested and allow all parties exhaust all their constitutional rights and provisions made available to them. While that is going on, democrats with proven track record of not being power-drunk and who also have themselves handed power over to members of the opposition including well respected figures like Nigeria’s Goodluck Jonathan, Ghana’s John Mahama, Kofi Annan, Emeka Anyaoku etc should have been in the delegation to the exclusion of the likes of our own Buhari. It is only after the courts might have ruled against him and such entreaties have failed that a military action becomes desirable. For now, let the delegation be reshuffled and let The Gambia run the full course of its own constitutional provisions. That way we do not attempt to right a wrong with another wrong.
Special aide to Brazil’s embattled president arrested in corruption probe  [SEP]  A special aide to embattled Brazilian President Michel Temer was arrested on Tuesday in connection with a fraud scheme and another aide gave police a bag filled with cash that was allegedly part of a bribe approved by the leader. RIO DE JANEIRO — A special aide to embattled Brazilian President Michel Temer was arrested on Tuesday in connection with a fraud scheme and another aide gave police a bag filled with cash that was allegedly part of a bribe approved by the leader. Tadeu Filippelli, who had an office neighboring Temer’s in the presidential palace, was arrested in connection with a fraud investigation into renovations of the Brasilia soccer stadium for the 2014 World Cup. Brazil’s federal police say the construction works were overpriced by more than $260 million. In the same operation, two former governors of Brazil’s Federal District, which includes capital Brasilia, were also arrested: Jose Roberto Arruda and Agnelo Queiroz. Filippelli heads the Brasilia branch of Temer’s Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, was vice-governor of the Federal District under Queiroz and is one of the five special aides to the president. Four of those aides now have been linked to corruption scandals. Only two remain in their positions. Brazil’s top court has opened investigations into Temer for alleged obstruction of justice and involvement in passive corruption. He says he’s innocent and rejects calls to resign. Meanwhile, another Temer aide, Rodrigo Rocha Loures, surrendered a bag filled with part of the $150,000 in alleged hush money meant for former House Speaker Eduardo Cunha, federal police said. Brazil’s top prosecutor said last week that Loures was suspected of serving as the president’s courier in sending funds to Cunha and prosecutors had already released a video showing Loures running out of a Sao Paulo restaurant carrying the bag. In a recorded conversation with an executive of the JBS meatpacking company, he had identified himself as Temer’s middleman. Temer has denied any wrongdoing and says that an audiotape that appeared to show him endorsing such a bribe was faked. Despite the wave of bad news for Brazil’s president and growing pressure for him to resign, Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles said in a meeting with investors in Sao Paulo that the political crisis will not stall the agenda for more austerity measures and unpopular reforms in the pension system and in labor laws. Asked by journalists whether he could be a candidate for president if Congress has to choose a replacement for Temer, Meirelles only smiled and waved.
Poundworld enters administration after rescue talks fail  [SEP]  Image copyright PA Discount retailer Poundworld has appointed administrators, putting 5,100 jobs at risk. The move came after talks with a potential buyer, R Capital, collapsed leaving Poundworld with no option other than administration. Poundworld, which serves two million customers a week from 335 stores, also trades under the Bargain Buys name. Administrators Deloitte stress the stores will continue to trade as normal with no redundancies at this time. It said in a statement: "Like many high street retailers, Poundworld has suffered from high product cost inflation, decreasing footfall, weaker consumer confidence and an increasingly competitive discount retail market. Clare Boardman, joint administrator at Deloitte, said: "The retail trading environment in the UK remains extremely challenging and Poundworld has been seeking to address this through a restructure of its business. "Unfortunately, this has not been possible." She said Deloitte believed a buyer could be found for the business, or at least part of it. A spokesperson for Poundworld''s owner, TPG said filing for administration had been "a difficult decision". "Despite investing resources to strengthen the business, the decline in UK retail and changing consumer behaviour affected Poundworld significantly," they added. Poundworld has been losing money for the past two years. Losses for the financial year 2016-17 were £17.1m, up from £5.4m the year before. Tough It's the latest High Street retailer to run into trouble. Just last week, department store chain House of Fraser said it would close 31 of its 59 shops, citing the need to adapt to "fundamental change" in the retail industry. A combination of falling consumer confidence, rising overheads, the weaker pound and the growth of online shopping have made it tough for traditional retailers. Electronics chain Maplin and toy chain Toys 'R' Us both collapsed into administration earlier this year. Other High Street chains such as Mothercare and Carpetright have been forced to close stores in order to survive. Restaurant chains such as Italian chain Carluccio's, pizza restaurant Prezzo and burger chain Byron have also had to close stores as they battle a triple-whammy of falling trade, higher costs and increased competition. Analysis by BBC business correspondent Jonty Bloom Only a few years ago Poundworld was expanding aggressively, now it is set to become yet another High Street casualty. It has, of course, been hit by the usual suspects, lower consumer confidence, falling footfall and more online shopping. But for pound shops these problems can be multiplied; for a start they depend on high turnover because the margin of profit when everything is sold for a pound is minute. Then they import a lot of what they sell, including large amounts from specialised suppliers in China. The weakness of the pound has pushed up the cost of imports and when by definition it is impossible to increase their prices, the squeeze on pound shop profits can be dramatic and very sudden. 'Too many mouths' Independent retail analyst Richard Hyman said Poundworld was simply not managing its business well enough. "The clue's in the name: These days having a fixed price in the title is a disadvantage but it is not a killer disadvantage. "Importing products is not peculiar to Poundworld but others have been getting round this by getting manufacturers to put fewer biscuits in the pack, for example. "The bigger picture is there are too many retailers with too many stores for the market to feed." But despite the collapse of so many stores, David Gill, the national officer for the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, was not wholly pessimistic: "When Toys R Us went into administration we had a number of retailers we work closely with saying 'there are job vacancies can you point them in this direction?', but whether you can absorb all 5,000 jobs that's another discussion." Poundworld, which has its headquarters in West Yorkshire, was formed in 2004, but it says it can trace its origins "back to 1974 and a market stall in Wakefield, West Yorkshire". In 2014 Poundworld's founder Chris Edwards took a central part in a BBC documentary about the intense competition between the company and its rivals Poundstretcher and Poundland. Investment company TPG, which bought a majority stake in Poundworld in 2015, also controls the restaurant chain Prezzo whose landlords and creditors agreed a restructuring last month.
Taiwan train derailment in Yilan County kills at least 18  [SEP]  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Puyuma Express 6432 service came off the tracks close to Xinma station At least 18 people have been killed and 187 injured after a passenger train derailed in north-east Taiwan. Railway authorities say they are investigating the accident, which happened in Yilan County at about 16:50 local time (08:50 GMT) on Sunday. A total of 366 passengers were on the train when all eight of its carriages derailed. The incident is Taiwan's worst rail accident in 27 years. At least three children were among the dead. "The train was going very fast. I hit a wall when the car started to flip. Around five to six people were thrown out of the carriage door," passenger Henry Tseng told Reuters news agency. "There [was] no time to think what happened. Everyone was in a rush to get out." It is not clear if any passengers remain unaccounted for - with reports providing conflicting details. 'Overturned at 90 degrees' The Puyuma Express 6432 service came off the tracks close to Xinma station, near the town of Su'ao about 70km (43 miles) from Taipei. It was travelling between Taipei and the eastern county of Taitung. "There are four carriages that were overturned at 90 degrees and the worst casualties were in those carriages," said Jackson Lu, director-general of the Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA). He had earlier told a press conference that the train was only six years old and had been in "pretty good condition" before the accident. It remains unclear what caused the train to derail, but witnesses told local media they heard a loud noise then sparks and smoke. Video footage on local television showed passengers breaking windows to escape the carriages. "I smashed the safety glass and crawled out and I helped to pull a young man out," one passenger told reporters. "There was a person sitting behind me. I'm not sure she survived." Image copyright AFP Image caption Authorities say five of the train's eight carriages ended up on their side Another woman, Tung Xiao-ling, lost eight family members who had been returning from her sister's wedding celebration. "No one can accept that one day you are a bride and the next day you are mourning a family member," Ms Tung, who was not onboard, told Reuters. An AFP news agency reporter at the scene said more bodies were being removed from the damaged carriages at about 20:00 local time (12:00 GMT) on Sunday night. Photographs from the scene show seats upended, with parts of the railway tracks twisted through carriage windows in places. Image copyright AFP Image caption Tsai Ing-wen has asked for a speedy investigation Taiwan's leader, Tsai Ing-wen, arrived in Xinma on Monday morning. She said she had "asked prosecutors to clarify the situation" and quickly determine what caused the derailment. She also met relatives of passengers affected by the disaster. "We are really sorry... you have to stay strong," Ms Tsai told the mother of a seventh-grade girl who was killed in the crash. Taiwan has an extensive train network and more than half a million passengers travel on the system every day.
Opposition should avoid double standards, politics of allegations: PML-N  [SEP]  ISLAMABAD, April 21 (APP): Lashing out at the major opposition parties in the Parliament, leaders of Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) on Friday said they should avoid double standards approach and shun politics of allegations. “The opposition which has rejected formation of Joint Investigation Team (JIT) in Panamagate case showed that they have accepted that the verdict announced by Supreme Court was not against the premier Nawaz Sharif”, leader of the house in Senate, Raja Zafar ul Haq said. Talking to media persons outside the Parliament House here, he said instead of playing their due role in the Parliament, the opposition preferred politics of agitation and continued hue and cry to disrupt the proceedings in the house. With regard to walkout from the house, he said the opposition was given an ample opportunity to present their stance but they opted walk out. Answering a question, Raja Zafar ul Haq said the opposition has no moral justification to demand resignation from the Prime Minister. He said opposition seemed perplexed and raising hue and cry as the verdict announced on Thursday was against their wishes. “The Thursday’s verdict was the victory of Nawaz Sharif, his party and people of Pakistan”, he remarked. Minister of State for Capital Administration and Development Division, Tariq Fazal Chaudhry also criticized the opposition over its double standard role and said those who are declared corrupt were now leveling allegations of corruption on other innocents. He said it is the practice of what he called “the most corrupt Pakistan Peoples Party not to accept any court’s verdict which they think is not meeting their negative designs”. The decision announced by the apex court in Panam papers case has cleared the premier of all the allegations levelled against him and his family. He said it is the government which had recommended formation of Judicial Commission but the opposition took the case to apex court. Replying to a question, the minister said PTI Chief Imran Khan levelled false allegations against daughter of Prime Minister Marriyum Nawaz, but in the detailed verdict, nothing was proved against her. He said hardly there was any politician in history of Pakistan who and his family faced such a strict accountability process but it is Nawaz Sharif who voluntarily offered himself for the accountability. Minister of State for Water and Power Chaudhry Abid Sher Ali said yesterday was the victory of the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif as the decision was in favour of democracy and justice. “We respect the Constitution of Pakistan and the dignity and sanctity of our institutions”, he added. He said the demand of the opposition is reflective of their frustration on the decision. He said April 20 was the auspicious day for the people and the workers of PML-N. He said that all the political parties should honour the decision of the apex court and avoid creating hurdles in the path of investigation by JIT. Abid Sher Ali said the majority of the judges have given a clean chit to the Prime Minister. Member of National Assembly, Daniyal Aziz said Imran Khan himself concealed his own off shore companies. He said the PTI Chief also whitened his black money while his right hand Jehangir Tarin was a proven corrupt.
Justice Department charges hundreds in massive health care, opioid fraud scheme  [SEP]  More than 400 people, including doctors, pharmacists and nurses, were charged in connection with a massive health care fraud scheme that bilked the federal government of more than $1 billion, officials from the Justice Department and Department of Health and Human Services announced Thursday. About a quarter of those were charged with fraud specifically related to opioids. Describing some of the cases brought, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said trusted medical professionals “have chosen to violate their oaths and put greed ahead of their patients.” Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said the health care fraud bust targeted those who “maliciously contributed” to the nation’s opioid epidemic. In all, 412 people, including 56 doctors, were charged as a result of the nationwide operation. The Justice Department said those accused have defrauded taxpayers of approximately $1.3 billion. “Some doctors wrote out more prescriptions for controlled substances than entire hospitals were writing,” said FBI acting Director Andrew McCabe. According to federal prosecutors, the individuals charged were involved in schemes in which they submitted claims to Medicare and Medicaid for treatments that were either medically unnecessary or never provided. Patient recruiters were used in some cases and paid cash kickbacks for collection beneficiary information for providers that would be used to submit fraudulent bills to the government. “One fake rehab facility for drug addicts in Palm Beach is alleged to have recruited addicts with gift cards, visits to strip clubs, and even drugs-enabling the company to bill for over $58 million in false treatments and tests,” Mr. Sessions said.
Helicopter carrying commandos frees notorious French inmate  [SEP]  PARIS (AP) — A notorious French criminal serving 25 years for murder made an audacious escape from prison Sunday after a helicopter carrying several heavily armed commandos landed in a courtyard, freed him from a visiting room and carried him away. It was the second daring escape by Redoine Faid, who once blasted his way out of a different prison with explosives hidden in tissue packs. His latest escape, from Reau Prison, took only "a few minutes," France's Justice Ministry said. Unarmed guards said they could do nothing to prevent it. Dressed all in black, two commandos wearing balaclavas and police armbands entered the prison to look for Faid. They used a grinding machine to open the door to the visiting room, Martial Delabroye, a representative of the guards' union, told BFM television. The commandos used smoke canisters to hide from video cameras, and the helicopter touched down in the only part of the complex that was not covered by anti-helicopter netting, said another union member, Loic Delbroc. When the chopper arrived, Faid was meeting with his brother in the visiting room. A third commando was holding the pilot at gunpoint, union members said. French media reported that the three men took the pilot hostage at a flying club in the Paris region. He was later released with no physical injuries. The helicopter was found burned in the town of Garges-les-Gonesse, in the northern suburbs of Paris. Faid was believed to have left by car along with his accomplices. French prosecutors opened a new investigation into Faid, 46, who was serving time for the 2010 death of a young police officer killed during a botched robbery. Investigators were questioning his brother on Sunday afternoon. After his 2013 escape, Faid was arrested at a hotel six weeks later. In the 1990s, he led a gang involved in robbing banks and armored vans. He was arrested in 1998 after three years on the run in Switzerland and Israel, according to French media reports. Faid was freed in 2009 after serving 10 years. At the time, he swore that he had turned his life around, writing a confessional book about his life of crime and going on an extensive media tour in 2010. Still, he was the suspected mastermind of the attempted armed robbery in 2010 that led to a high-speed chase and a shootout with police that killed 26-year-old Aurelie Fouquet. He was arrested in 2011.
Senior Chinese monk resigns amid sexual misconduct claims  [SEP]  One of China’s most high-profile Buddhist monks has resigned from a national post after reports of sexual misconduct, a religious association has said. The Buddhist Association of China said on Wednesday its president, Shi Xuecheng, had passed his duties to a deputy. The case, which has been covered widely in the Chinese press and discussed on social media, is seen as a sign of the #MeToo movement’s growing momentum in China. A small but increasing number of academics, civil society activists and one of China’s best known television hosts have been called out for inappropriate behaviour, although the movement has yet to percolate into government circles. The announcement of Xuecheng’s resignation was included in a report about the Buddhist association’s regular meeting and did not mention the controversy surrounding him. Fellow monks accused Xuecheng earlier this year of harassing and demanding sexual favours from nuns at his Beijing monastery as well as embezzling funds, allegations that Xuecheng has denied on social media. Xuecheng has not commented publicly on his resignation. One of China’s best known monks and authors, Xuecheng was an influential political adviser to the central government while heading the national Buddhist association. His Longquan monastery on the north-west outskirts of Beijing is popular with educated Chinese, including many who give up high-paid jobs to devote their lives to religious study. Two long-serving monks compiled a 95-page dossier on Xuecheng this year and turned it over to Beijing police. The document, which included alleged screenshots of his text messages to nuns and the monastery’s financial statements, was leaked on Chinese social media in July and became a national sensation. Xuecheng has dismissed the records as a fabrication. There are about 250 million Buddhists in China. That number is likely to grow fast as a number of young Chinese are turning increasingly spiritual – embracing Taoism, Christianity and Islam as well. The powerful state administration of religious affairs, which regulates religion under the communist government, announced an investigation into Xuecheng last week. The agency reposted the Buddhist association’s report on its own website on Wednesday but did not carry additional comment or provide updates on its investigation. Separately on Wednesday, lawyers representing Zhu Jun, a host on state-operated China Central Television (CCTV), said they were suing social media users who posted and recirculated allegations of harassment against Zhu by one of his former interns. Zhu, the host of CCTV’s Spring Festival evening gala and one of China’s most recognisable faces, denies the allegations. Zhu’s lawyers posted their intentions on the WeChat social media platform.
55 protesters killed at Gaza fence  [SEP]  GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip -- In a jarring contrast, Israeli forces shot and killed at least 55 Palestinians and wounded more than 1,200 during mass protests Monday along the Gaza border, while just a few miles away Israel and the U.S. held a festive inauguration ceremony for the new American Embassy in contested Jerusalem. It was by far the deadliest day of cross-border violence since a devastating 2014 war between Israel and Gaza's Hamas rulers, and further dimmed the prospects for President Donald Trump's hoped-for peace plan. Throughout the day, Gaza protesters set tires ablaze, sending thick plumes of black smoke into the air, and hurled firebombs and stones toward Israeli troops across the border. The Israeli military, which has come under international criticism for using excessive force against unarmed protesters, said Hamas tried to carry out bombing and shooting attacks under the cover of the protests and released video of protesters ripping away parts of the barbed-wire border fence. Monday's protests culminated more than a month of weekly demonstrations aimed at breaking a crippling Israeli-Egyptian border blockade. But the U.S. Embassy move, bitterly opposed by the Palestinians, added further fuel. There was barely any mention of the Gaza violence at Monday's inauguration ceremony for the new embassy, an upgraded consular building located just 50 miles away. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials joined an American delegation of Trump administration officials and Republican and evangelical Christian supporters. The Palestinians, who seek east Jerusalem as their capital, have cut off ties with the Trump administration and say the U.S. is unfit to serve as a mediator. Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed the area in a move that is not internationally recognized. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, furious over the embassy ceremony, said he "will not accept" any peace deal proposed by the Trump administration. The Palestinian president also urged the international community to condemn what he said were "massacres" carried out by Israeli troops in Gaza, and officials said the Palestinians would file a war crimes complaint against Israel in the International Criminal Court over settlement construction. By nightfall, at least 55 Palestinians, including a young girl and four other minors, were killed, the Gaza Health Ministry said. It said 1,204 Palestinians were wounded by gunfire, including 116 who were in serious or critical condition. Egypt, an important Israeli ally, condemned the killings of Palestinian protesters, while the U.N. human rights chief, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, decried the "shocking killing of dozens." The European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, called on Israel to respect the "principle of proportionality in the use of force" and show restraint, while also urging Hamas to ensure any protests remain peaceful. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued a similar appeal. The U.N. Security Council set a meeting today to discuss the violence. At the U.S. Embassy ceremony in Jerusalem, Jared Kushner placed the blame on the Gaza protesters. "As we have seen from the protests of the last month and even today, those provoking violence are part of the problem and not part of the solution," he said. Responsibility for the violence Monday rested "squarely with Hamas," said Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, for "intentionally and cynically provoking" Israel by urging Palestinians to storm the border fence. "Israel has the right to defend itself," he said. In Gaza, Khalil al-Hayya, deputy chief of Hamas, blamed the United States for inciting the violence by moving the embassy to Jerusalem, reversing decades of U.S. policy and defying international consensus. "The American administration bears responsibility for all consequences following the implementation of this unjust decision," he said. The Israeli military estimated a turnout of about 40,000 at Monday's protest, saying it fell short of what Hamas had hoped for. But officials described what they called "unprecedented violence" unseen in previous weeks. Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said hundreds of protesters carried out "concerted, coordinated" attacks on the border fence. Although the crowd did not manage to break through, he said they caused "significant damage." The army released video showing demonstrators setting a cargo crossing on fire and appearing to climb on the fence as they lobbed flaming objects into the Israeli side. Some in the crowds were planting or hurling explosives, Israel said, and many were flying flaming kites into Israel: At least one kite outside the Nahal Oz kibbutz, across the fence from Gaza City, ignited a wildfire. Conricus also said Hamas militants disguised as protesters tried to infiltrate, and there were at least three instances of armed Hamas gunmen trying to carry out attacks. Israeli aircraft and tanks struck seven Hamas positions. Since the protests began on March 30, 105 Palestinians have been killed, most of them protesters. Israel said it killed three militants trying to plant a bomb along the fence, and Palestinian security officials said several Hamas militants were also killed by Israeli shelling in northern Gaza. Israel has made clear throughout the protests that it holds Hamas responsible for any violence emanating from Gaza, and Conricus made no apologies for the body count. "Hamas is killing Gaza," he said. "We, on the other hand, are defending our homes." Throughout the day, sirens wailed as the wounded were carried to ambulances. Groups of young activists repeatedly approached the fence, but were quickly scattered by gunfire and tear gas.

Germany's center-left Social Democrats to elect new leader  [SEP]  BERLIN (AP) — Germany's center-left Social Democrats are electing a new leader to spearhead the party's recovery from a disastrous election result and guide it through a fractious coalition government with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives. Andrea Nahles, the combative leader of the party's parliamentary group, is overwhelmingly favored to win election at a congress in Wiesbaden on Sunday. But, unusually for Germany, she has a challenger in Simone Lange, the left-leaning mayor of the northern town of Flensburg. The Social Democrats slumped to their worst result since World War II in September's election, securing only 20.5 percent of the vote. The party initially planned to go into opposition, but reluctantly changed course after Merkel's negotiations with two smaller parties collapsed and eventually agreed to enter another "grand coalition" as the chancellor's junior partner.
Judge refuses to block chess websites from showing moves  [SEP]  NEW YORK (AP)  Websites showing moves almost as they occur at the World Chess Championship can continue to do so over the objections of the tournament organizers, a judge ruled Thursday, a day before the tournament is to begin. U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero said he was not persuaded that organizers of the $1 million, 12-game tournament had a legal right to block the websites from disclosing the moves until after each game, which can last several hours. The websites maintain that they learn of the moves through social media or elsewhere before discussing them on their websites. Current champion Magnus Carlsen, of Norway, and Sergey Karjakin, of Russia, are competing in the tournament that begins Friday in lower Manhattan. World Chess US Inc. and World Chess Events Ltd. sued the websites on Monday, saying they will take advantage of a $15 live feed of the tournament to relay word of each move over the internet. The lawsuit had also sought $4.5 million in damages. The defendants were Chessgames Services LLC, E-Learning Ltd. and Logical Thinking Ltd. World Chess CEO Ilya Merenzon said outside court that the legal action was a result of growing pains the sports is going through as it tries to make money. “We”re kind of taken hostage at this point,” he said. “We can”t protect the integrity of the business model.” Prior to Marrero”s ruling from the bench, World Chess attorney Robert LoBue told the judge that he believed the websites were stealing word of the moves from the tournament”s live feed. “It”s not an athletic sport,” LoBue added. “The moves are the very essence of the event.” He said it wasn”t fair that some websites can steal what his client spends millions of dollars to develop. In court papers, Colin McGourty defended himself as the editor in chief of Chess24.com, which is run by E-Learning Ltd. and Logical Thinking Ltd. He said the Gibraltar-based company”s website, launched publicly in 2014, attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors each month. He said it shows chess moves on a computer-generated “virtual” chess board based on what it learns from publicly available sources. He noted, for instance, that the championship will be broadcast on Norwegian television. And each move will be discussed extensively on social media, he said.
Injured tourists forced to flee as Mount Etna erupts  [SEP]  Several tourists have reportedly been injured as Mount Etna erupted for the third time in just under three weeks, spitting molten lava nearly 650 feet into the sky above Sicily. A BBC journalist and camera crew were caught in the huge explosion on Thursday. 'Lava flow mixed with steam - caused huge explosion - group pelted with boiling rocks and steam,' the BBC's global science correspondent, Rebecca Morelle, tweeted. She reported an estimated eight people suffered head injuries, burns, cuts and bruises. 'An amazing 78 year old lady was very close - but safely got away,' Ms Morelle tweeted. 'Incident could have been worse - explosions like this have killed - but seems minor injuries for now. 'BBC team all OK - some cuts/ bruises and burns. Very shaken though - it was extremely scary. 'Running down a mountain pelted by rocks, dodging burning boulders and boiling steam - not an experience I ever ever want to repeat,' she added. Italian news reports say scientists investigating the recent eruptions were injured when magma spewing from the volcano hit snow, causing an explosion. The Catania operation center of Italy's volcanology institute confirmed Thursday that members of a team taking measurements on the active volcano had been injured, but had no details on the numbers involved or the seriousness of the injuries. The Catania Today website reported that at least three volcanologists were on the volcano when the explosion occurred just before noon, and that some were injured. This latest phase of activity at Europe's highest volcano follows the first eruption in more than a year at the end of February. The eruption came from a relatively new crater on the southeastern side of the 3,000-metre peak. It was captured on film by Italy's Geology and Vulcanology Institute (INGV). Etna has been putting on a show in recent days, however Catania's airport remains open and there have been only periodic spews of volcanic ash.
Quebec says up to 70 people may have died in connection with recent heat wave  [SEP]  MONTREAL — Health authorities say up to 70 people may have died in Quebec as a result of heat-related complications since the beginning of an early July heat wave that saw temperatures climb to more than 40 C with the humidex. Temperatures have since cooled off across the province and a spokesperson with Quebec’s Public Health Department says Monday it would no longer be giving updates on heat-related deaths because “the situation is back to normal.” Most of the deaths occurred in Montreal, with 34 cases reported to authorities. The city’s morgue became so overcrowded during the heat wave that it partnered with a funeral home, where it sent bodies for storage. Montreal’s public health office says the majority of people who died in the city during the heat wave were over 60 and suffered from chronic illnesses. Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard says no patients died in government-run health-care centres.
A Derby with lightly raced colts, and lots of possibilities  [SEP]  LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Todd Pletcher is throwing numbers at the Kentucky Derby again. Bob Baffert is seeking a fifth victory and he’s got the favorite, too. An old jinx could be disproved, and history would be written if Mendelssohn wears the garland of red roses. The 20-horse field for Saturday’s 144th Run for the Roses includes a handful of top contenders who have been consistent this spring. Justify was the 7-2 favorite in early wagering Friday. Trained by Baffert, the Southern California colt, however, is green, with just three starts. “We have a good enough horse that can win it, but it’s a very competitive race,” Baffert said. “You’re going to have to have some luck.” Justify is undefeated and Magnum Moon is 4-0, neither having run as a 2-year-old. They’ll be trying to upend a so-called curse: No horse since Apollo in 1882 has won without racing as a juvenile. Arkansas Derby winner Magnum Moon is one of four horses to be saddled by Todd Pletcher, who won last year’s Derby with Always Dreaming. Pletcher’s Audible was the co-third choice at 6-1 with Mendelssohn on Friday. Along with Magnum Moon, Vino Rosso and Noble Indy were double-digit longshots for the trainer, who is tied with mentor D. Wayne Lukas for the most Derby starters with 48. Mendelssohn has the least amount of time on the Churchill Downs dirt than any horse in the field. The Ireland-based colt made his first appearance Thursday — drawing attention with his screeching — after spending the first part of the week in quarantine for Aidan O’Brien. The trainer is 0 for 5 at the Derby, the biggest victory to elude him. Mendelssohn was an 18 ½-length winner of the UAE Derby. His regal bloodlines and $3 million price tag suggest he would be a worthy champion, but no Europe-based horse has won the Derby. My Boy Jack moved up to the 5-1 second choice in early wagering Friday. The closer is trained by Keith Desormeaux and ridden by Kent Desormeaux, a three-time Derby winner and Keith’s brother. Despite Good Magic’s top-notch credentials, he was relegated to the 7-1 fifth choice on Friday. He won the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile and claimed an Eclipse Award as last year’s 2-year-old champion. The colt won the Blue Grass last month, one of six victories at six different tracks. Getting the ideal trip in the Derby is critical, especially with the traffic from 20 horses making a chaotic charge into the first turn. Jockeys want to avoid anything that would prevent their horse from getting into rhythm, like being bumped, cut off or blocked. “There’s so many horses in the field that seem like they have good chances to win the race with a clean trip,” said Chad Brown, who trains Good Magic. “I feel like we have one of them.” High school dropout Mick Ruis will try to become just the third owner-trainer to win. He has Bolt d’Oro, the colt named in part for Olympic champion sprinter Usain Bolt. Bolt d’Oro finished second to Justify in the Santa Anita Derby. “This is the best we’ve had him,” Ruis said. Besides Baffert, four other Hall of Fame trainers are in the race: Steve Asmussen (Combatant), Jerry Hollendorfer (Instilled Regard), Lukas (Bravazo) and Bill Mott (Hofburg). Baffert and Lukas are tied for the second-most wins with four each. None of the others has won a Derby. Hofburg is Mott’s first Kentucky Derby runner in nine years. Hofburg has just three career starts, including a runner-up finish in the Florida Derby. “This may be as good a chance as I’ve ever had,” Mott said. “Some of the tougher horses in the race are fairly lightly raced.” The frequently changing forecast for Saturday calls for a chance of rain at different times during the day. Post time is 6:46 p.m.
Dubai aims to have passenger-carrying drone taxi in service in July  [SEP]  Up, up and away: Dubai hopes to have a passenger-carrying drone regularly buzzing through the skyline of this futuristic city-state in July. The arrival of the Chinese-made EHang 184 — which already has had its flying debut over Dubai’s iconic, sail-shaped Burj al-Arab skyscraper hotel — comes as the Emirati city also has partnered with other cutting-edge technology companies, including Hyperloop One. The question is whether the egg-shaped, four-legged craft will really take off as a transportation alternative in this car-clogged city already home to the world’s longest driverless metro line. Mattar al-Tayer, the head of Dubai’s Roads & Transportation Agency, announced plans to have the craft regularly flying at the World Government Summit. Before his remarks on Monday, most treated the four-legged, eight-propeller craft as just another curiosity at an event that views itself as a desert Davos. “This is not only a model,” al-Tayer said. “We have actually experimented with this vehicle flying in Dubai’s skies.” The craft can carry a passenger weighing up to 100 kilograms (220 pounds) and a small suitcase. After buckling into its race-car-style seat, the craft’s sole passenger selects a destination on a touch-screen pad in front of the seat and the drone flies there automatically. The drone, which has a battery allowing for a half-hour flight time and a range of up to 50 kilometres (31 miles), will be monitored remotely by a control room on the ground. It has a top speed of 160 kph (100 mph), but authorities say it will be operated typically at 100 kph (62 mph). Al-Tayer said the drone would begin regular operations in July. He did not elaborate. The Road and Transportation Agency later issued a statement saying the drone had been examined by the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority and was controlled through 4G mobile internet. The agency did not immediately respond to further questions from The Associated Press. The United Arab Emirates already requires drone hobbyists to register their aircraft. However, drone intrusions at Dubai International Airport, the world’s busiest for international travel, has seen it shut down for hours at a time in recent months. EHang did not respond to a request for comment. In May, authorities in Nevada announced they would partner with EHang to test the 184 to possibly be cleared by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. The drone may be a techno curiosity for now but Dubai — the commercial capital of the oil-rich UAE and home to the long-haul carrier Emirates — has bold visions for the future and the 184 fits right into its plans. Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, announced in April he wanted 25 per cent of all passenger trips in the city to be done by driverless vehicles in 2030. To that end, Dubai already has had the box-shaped driverless EZ10, built by France’s EasyMile, cruise nearby the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building. In October, Dubai signed a deal with Los Angeles-based Hyperloop One to study the potential for building a hyperloop line between it and Abu Dhabi, the Emirati capital. A hyperloop has levitating pods powered by electricity and magnetism that hurtle through low-friction pipes at a top speed of 1,220 kph (760 mph). Elon Musk, the co-founder of Tesla who appeared on Monday at the Dubai conference, first proposed the idea of a hyperloop in 2013. Musk, who took no questions from reporters on Monday, later launched his Tesla car brand in Dubai at an event organizers said was not open to international media. Musk has come under criticism for serving on a business council advising U.S. President Donald Trump.
Pretargeted Radionuclide Therapy for HER2-expressing Cancers Shows Promising Results  [SEP]  Use of peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-mediated pretargeting enables a safe application of affibody molecules for radionuclide therapy, stated study published in The Journal of Nuclear Medicine. ‘A new, affibody-based pretargeted radionuclide therapy for HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2)-expressing cancers is non-toxic to the kidneys and improves survival.’ "Affibody molecules, small proteins engineered to bind to specific tumor-associated target proteins, have demonstrated excellent features for targeted molecular imaging, but their application for radionuclide therapy has so far been prevented by high renal reabsorption," explains Vladimir Tolmachev, DMSc, professor at Uppsala University in Uppsala, Sweden.For the study, affibody-pretargeted lutetium-177 (177Lu)-labeled PNA was tested and evaluated in mice bearing HER2-expressing xenografts. Experimental radionuclide therapy of the mice was performed in six cycles separated by 7 days.The data showed very rapid clearance of 177Lu-PNA from most tissues. The only tissues with prominent uptake were the kidneys and tumor, however, tumor uptake was four-fold higher than renal uptake at one hour post-injection. In addition, 84 percent of the renal uptake cleared with a 15-minute half-life, whereas the tumor clearance half-life was 63 hours.Results demonstrate that this pretargeting system can deliver an absorbed dose to tumors that appreciably exceeds the dose to critical organs, making affibody-based PNA-mediated pretargeted radionuclide therapy highly attractive.Marion de Jong, PhD, professor at Erasmus MC in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, states, "The safe application of radiolabeled affibody molecules for radionuclide therapy in patients will open up a whole new world of therapeutic options, as affibody molecules are excellent targeting moieties and can be generated for a wide range of targets."de Jong adds, "More specifically regarding anti-HER2 applications, the pretargeted affibody-based anti-HER2 might be used for treatment of patients who developed resistance to trastuzumab or other HER2-targeting therapies. Such resistance might be accompanied by preserved high expression of HER2."Amelie Eriksson Karlström, PhD, professor at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, points out additional advantages to using an affibody molecule as the pretargeting vector, explaining, "Production of affibody molecules is much cheaper than the production of antibodies. This might make our constructs more affordable and available."She adds, "Another important feature of our approach is the modular design of the construct. The Sortase A-mediated coupling can easily be used for the conjugation of an affibody molecule with specificity to a different target or even another class of targeting scaffold protein. Labelsare not limited to 177Lu; probes could also be labeled with the alpha-emitting nuclides actinium-225 (225Ac) or thorium-227 (227Th), or a positron-emitting nuclide such as gallium-68 (68Ga) for theranostics (both diagnosis and therapy). We anticipate that this study is a first step in the validation of a versatile pretargeting platform."Source: Eurekalert
Gambia to hold first free parliamentary election in 22 years | West Africa  [SEP]  Gambians go to the polls on April 6 to vote for members of parliament in the first legislative election since Adama Barrow became president, and former dictator Yahya Jammeh was forced into exile. This is the most important vote in the country after presidential elections and this year it will be carried out under a democratic regime for the first time in over two decades. Jammeh took power in a coup in 1994, and his government was accused of torturing and killing perceived opponents. On the streets of the capital Banjul, people say they are excited to express themselves freely as candidates from nine political parties, including Jammeh's Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC), campaign in what voters say is a different Gambia. "Of course, I am very happy that the elections are different than before. Because these elections that passed for the presidential elections was very fair and I know that the coming parliamentary elections will be very fair too," says one man sitting at the corner of the street. Officials of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) say they have invited a full European Union observer mission to monitor the process. Voters are given one marble each, which they drop into a drum corresponding to the candidate of their choice. This is the same system that saw Barrow declared winner after polls in December. Jammeh initially conceded defeat to Barrow before back-tracking, launching weeks of political turmoil until a West African force swooped in and convinced him to go into exile. During the crisis, Alieu Mommar Njai - the IEC chairman who announced the results, had to flee to neighbouring Senegal after threats from Jammeh's government. Jammeh accused the IEC of making a mistake when counting the votes. "In the system that existed before, there is no complete independence in any institution, in particular the IEC. It was not what we want, but what he wants and this has caused some problems for us. Now that we are totally independent and this is organised by the new government, they are out for freedom, for justice and for transparency," said Njai, who is overseeing the upcoming polls. Halifa Sallah is the candidate for the People's Democratic Organisation for Independence and Socialism (PDOIS) party. As the secretary General of PDOIS, Sallah has toured the country to support the other candidates from his party. Opposition parties go it alone Now, he is trying to convince people in the city of Serrekunda to vote for him in what he calls a house-to-house campaign; going to people's homes and talking with them, instead of holding big rallies. During Jammeh's rule, parliament was seen as an extension of the presidency. Since the last legislative elections in 2012 Jammeh's APRC held 48 out of 53 seats in parliament. This time, each of them goes to the April 6 polls alone and analysts are waiting to see how if this weakens the position of the coalition to gain a majority in parliament for president Barrow. Gambia is one of Africa's smallest countries and has had just two presidents since independence in 1965.
Kentucky Man, Transgender Wife Sue Amazon For Workplace Bias  [SEP]  (AP) – A Kentucky man and his transgender wife sued Amazon on Wednesday, alleging that they endured sustained discrimination and harassment during a year as co-workers at the mammoth online retailer’s warehouse in northern Kentucky. A lawyer working with the couple said the case is notable in part because Amazon, one of the nation’s largest corporations, has a record of strongly supporting gay and transgender rights. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Covington, Kentucky, alleges that Dane Lane and Allegra Schawe-Lane were targeted with threats, slurs and sexual harassment by numerous colleagues at their shipping facility. Their complaints to superiors led to retaliation in some cases, rather than any effective steps to halt the abuse, the couple contends. At one point, according to the suit, the brake line of their car was severed while parked in a secure lot at the workplace in Hebron, Kentucky. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The plaintiffs’ case will be handled by Kentucky lawyers on behalf of the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund, a national transgender-rights organization. The fund’s executive director, Jillian Weiss, noted that Amazon has intervened in other court cases in support of transgender rights, and that the company’s Amazon Studios produced the acclaimed television series “Transparent” with a protagonist who transitions from male to female. “We have a company that touts its transgender friendliness,” Weiss said. “Yet in Kentucky, when a transgender person comes and says, ‘Look, I’m being harassed,’ they get no help.” Schawe-Lane said she sought a job with Amazon in part because of the company’s reputation as LGBT-friendly. Its own corporate policy prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. “I thought we would be safe and accepted,” Schawe-Lane said in a telephone interview. “Instead it was like a bad dream. Every day, I’d wish it was ‘Candid Camera’ and someone would pop out and say it was all a joke.” The couple was hired by Amazon in October 2014 and resigned a year later, saying conditions at their workplace were intolerable. Two months before resigning, they filed discrimination charges with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The EEOC declared earlier this year that evidence substantiated some of the couple’s allegations and said they had grounds for a lawsuit. The lawsuit seeks both compensatory payment and punitive damages, with the amount to be determined by a jury. It also seeks a court order requiring Amazon to implement workplace programs that would ensure respectful treatment of transgender employees. Several other transgender-rights lawsuits have been litigated recently, with mixed results. The Kentucky case alleges that various abuses suffered by the plaintiffs violated provisions of the U.S. and Kentucky civil rights acts, state and federal labor law, and also the Americans With Disabilities Act. According to Weiss, the ADA comes into play in this case because Schawe-Lane’s status as a transgender woman was perceived her employers as a disability. Aside from their experience at Amazon, they couple said they generally feel accepted in their community and have no desire to leave Kentucky. However, they said they are both undergoing treatment related to the workplace traumas they experienced, and have been advised by their doctors that they are not ready to take new jobs.
Dozens killed as overcrowded bus plunges into gorge in India  [SEP]  At least 48 people were killed on Sunday when an overcrowded bus plunged off a mountain road into a gorge in northern India, officials said. Chief minister of Uttarakhand state Trivendra Rawat said the bus fell into a 700ft deep gorge in the Himalayan foothills. He said about a dozen other people were injured and taken to hospital. Police official Manoj Kumar said rescuers recovered 48 bodies from the accident site.
American hostage mom Caitlan Coleman leaves Canada, returns to US with children  [SEP]  Former Taliban hostage Caitlan Coleman returned to the United States with her three children on Monday, almost six years after she was abducted while backpacking across Afghanistan with her husband, ABC News has learned.Coleman is petitioning an Ottawa family court to grant her full legal custody of the children she shares with Joshua Boyle, who is facing multiple allegations of physical and sexual assault stemming from incidents since his return to Canada On Monday, a judge ruled that Coleman, a U.S. citizen, could relocate pending a resolution of her case, so she decided to leave both Canada and Boyle behind, crossing the U.S.-Canada border with her three children that same night.Coleman declined to comment, and Coleman's family declined to disclose her final destination but said the search for a suitable location for her and her family has taken on a new urgency - Caitlan discovered earlier this year that she is pregnant with her fourth child."I'm excited that my daughter and her children are finally coming back to the U.S. after all the years of captivity," Caitlan's father Jim told ABC News. "The first thing we want to do is to help Caity establish a good and stable home and help her and the kids continue their recovery from captivity."Boyle has pleaded not guilty to the charges filed against him. His criminal defense attorneys had no immediate comment in response to questions from ABC News.Coleman, 32, her Canadian husband Joshua Boyle, 34, and their three young children - all of whom were born as prisoners - were freed from captivity in Pakistan in October following a five-year ordeal under the control of the Afghan Taliban's extremist Haqqani Network.The family flew to Toronto and settled in Ottawa, and in her first television interview in November, Coleman detailed the family's harrowing experience in captivity, telling ABC News that she had once been raped by Taliban guards.It wasn't long, however, before the already bizarre saga took another dark turn. On New Year's Eve, police in Ottawa arrested Boyle and jailed him on multiple charges, including physical and sexual assault of a woman and physical assault of a child.The judge ordered a publication ban in January, meaning the alleged victims and most details of the criminal investigation could not be revealed by news media. As a general policy, ABC News does not name victims in cases of alleged sexual assault.Since the family's arrival in Canada, Boyle has made a series of contradictory claims about their reasons for traveling to Afghanistan in 2012 and about their captivity.Boyle was known in Canada for his activism even before becoming a hostage of the Haqqani Network. He was previously married to one of Canada's most outspoken pro-jihadi women, Zaynab Khadr, whose two brothers were imprisoned at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp but were later released.While U.S. intelligence officials always considered Coleman a Taliban hostage, officials often expressed doubts to ABC News about Boyle's motives in traveling to Afghanistan with his then-pregnant wife in 2012. Boyle told ABC News days before his arrest on assault charges that those doubts were unfounded and referred to his Haqqani captors as "criminal miscreants."Boyle was granted bail in June but still faces 19 criminal charges and is restricted to his parents' home in Smiths Falls, Ontario, while he continues psychiatric treatment and awaits trial.
9 deaths reported after inmates battle at Brazilian prison  [SEP]  Authorities in Brazil say a prison riot in the state of Goias has resulted in at least nine deaths and 14 injured people. Officials told the Brazilian news site G1 that the violence at the Colonia Agroindustrial prison in the Aparecida de Goiania Complex apparently erupted when inmates from one cellblock invaded three others where prisoners from rival gangs are housed. Local media said about 106 inmates escaped during the riot, but officials had recaptured 29. The reports said 127 other inmates fled during the violence but returned voluntarily.
'The United States is under attack': Intelligence chief Dan Coats says Putin targeting 2018 elections  [SEP]  WASHINGTON — Russia and other adversaries will continue to engage in cyber warfare to "degrade our democratic values and weaken our alliances," the nation's top intelligence official said Tuesday. "Frankly, the United States is under attack," Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats told the Senate Intelligence Committee, adding that every facet of society is being targeted with cyber intrusions. In unequivocal language, Coats said Russia President Vladimir Putin has been emboldened by Russia's successful interference in the 2016 elections and is targeting the 2018 election cycle. "There should be no doubt that (Putin) views the past effort as successful," Coats said. The national intelligence director's comments come against the backdrop of continuing congressional and criminal investigations into Russia's interference in the 2016 election and whether the Kremlin coordinated their activities with President Trump's campaign. Although Trump has repeatedly wavered on Russia's involvement, Coats and the nation's five other top intelligence officials Tuesday each affirmed a 2016 assessment of the entire intelligence community that Russia interfered in the election and has not relented in a strategy to undermine future elections. "This is not going to change or stop," National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers said. More: GOP's crazy Russia probe conspiracies are crushed in Fusion GPS transcript
Massive Fire Burns At Least 100 Homes In Valparaiso, Chile  [SEP]  A large fire broke out in the coastal Chilean city of Valparaiso on Monday evening, burning at least 100 homes, prompting the evacuation of about 400 people and sending plumes of smoke high in the air. Chilean Interior Minister Mahmud Aleuy said in televised remarks that 19 people had been slightly injured, including 16 suffering from respiratory issues. Power was initially cut to about 47,000 customers in the region, but had been restored to all but 350, he said. Dozens of fire brigades from Valparaiso and neighboring municipalities were deployed to fight the blaze, and investigators had been sent in to determine the cause of the fire, according to the government. Images on social media showed huge brown-gray columns of smoke emanating from a neighborhood high in one of the city’s hills, and pouring into the sky and out over the Pacific Ocean. Authorities said gusty winds and high temperatures were likely a factor in spreading the blaze. A drought in central Chile caused a record number of forest fires in the area last year, wreaking havoc on its key forestry industry and forcing evacuations in recent weeks near the capital, Santiago, about 60 miles (100 km) southeast of Valparaiso. “This is a high-risk zone and the sector has undergone an evacuation,” Aleuy said of the affected areas of Valparaiso. “It (evacuation) has been successful, and fortunately we don’t have any tragedies to grieve.” Valparaiso, a scenic, but gritty port city of 285,000, is the center of a metropolitan area of about 1 million, the second largest urban district in Chile. Built on steep hillsides in an area covered in pines, many of the city’s wooden structures are susceptible to fire, especially in the poorer neighborhoods higher in the hills. In 2014, a significantly larger fire killed 13 people and burned 2,000 homes. Many smaller fires have since hit the city.
Uttarakhand bus accident: President Kovind, PM Modi express grief  [SEP]  "Very sad to learn about the tragic bus accident in Pauri Garhwal, Uttarakhand. Rescue efforts are on and local authorities are doing their utmost to help. My condolences to the bereaved facilities and best wishes to those injured," President Kovind tweeted. "Extremely saddened by the bus accident in Pauri Garhwal, Uttarakhand. My deepest condolences to the bereaved families. I pray thatthose injured recoverat the earliest. Rescue operations are underway and authorities are providing all possible assistance at the accident site,"tweeted PM Modi. At least 48 people were killed and 10 injured when an overloaded private bus fell into a 200-metre deep gorge near Gween village in the district. The bus was on its way to Ramnagar, according to the state police. Offering his condolences, BJP chief Amit Shah said, "Pained to know about the loss of lives in a tragic bus accident in Pauri Garhwal, Uttarakhand. My deepest condolenceswiththe bereaved families and I pray for the speedy recovery of those who have been injured. Have also spoken to the local BJP unit to join the rescue operation."
Mass protests force Romania government climb-down  [SEP]  Romania’s premier announced Saturday a dramatic reversal on legislation that had been seen as a retreat on corruption, after the biggest protests since dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was toppled and executed in 1989. Demonstrators vowed to keep up the pressure on the government, however, after five days of protests culminating in an estimated 330,000 people taking to the streets nationwide on Saturday. Prime Minister Sorin Grindeanu said in a televised statement that the government would meet on Sunday to repeal an emergency decree that could have seen some corrupt officials escape prosecution. “I do not want to divide Romania,” Grindeanu said at government headquarters in central Bucharest, sparking celebrations among the estimated 120,000 people protesting outside for a fifth evening in a row. Raluca, a demonstrator in her 30s, said she was delighted but that the left-wing government, which has been in office for barely a month, was still not to be trusted. “People are going to remain very vigilant with this government,” she said. The decree, passed Tuesday and due to enter into force on February 10, was to make abuse of power a crime only punishable by jail if the sums involved exceeded 200,000 lei (€44,000, $47,500). The government also wants in a separate decree to be reviewed by parliament next week to free some 2,500 people from prison serving sentences of less than five years. Grindeanu, from the left-wing Social Democrats (PSD), said that the measures were to bring penal law into line with the constitution and reduce overcrowding in prisons. Critics said that the real aim was to let off some of the several thousand officials and politicians ensnared in a major anti-corruption drive in recent years, many of them from the PSD. Earlier this week Brussels, which had previously praised Romania for its efforts, warned against “backtracking.” Washington also said it was “deeply concerned” about “accountability” for corruption crimes. But most worried of all were ordinary Romanians, who poured onto the streets in numbers not seen since people power toppled Ceausescu and consigned the communist system to history in 1989. Saturday saw a noisy march in Bucharest by tens of thousands of people, holding banners, waving flags and blowing whistles and vuvuzela horns, to the parliament building where they formed a human chain. Other protests took place in other cities around the country like Timisoara, cradle of the 1989 revolution, and in Cluj and Sibiu. On Friday night there were between 200,000 and 250,000 people demonstrating around the country, and on Wednesday as many as 300,000 according to estimates by Romanian media. “It’s about the future of our children, for our kids. We want justice to be made,” said Georgiana Dragoi, a housewife taking part in a protest of families with children on Saturday morning. Civil servant Alexander, 30, pushing his baby in a pram in the Bucharest demo, said that he regularly experiences graft in his daily life. Corruption “is all around us, small things that make our lives much more difficult,” he said. “I work in the system and for a person inside it is terrifying.” Despite the celebrations at the government’s climb-down, Bucharest still echoed with the sounds of horns late into the night, as Romanians said they wanted to make sure the government lived up to its word. “There is no substance here, there are only words. We have to see this put in practice,” said businesswoman Aura Oprea. And unemployed demonstrator Abraham Mohammed, while saying he was “very happy that we solved this,” said the country still has a long way to go to root out corruption. “There are so many thieves in this country. They want to steal our future. They want to steal our future, our kids’ future, everyone’s future and that is very bad,” he said.
NASA's Mars Opportunity rover seen, but still not heard  [SEP]  NASA's Mars rover, Opportunity has been seen, but still not heard. A spacecraft around Mars has sent back a photo of Opportunity, which has been silent ever since a massive dust storm engulfed the red planet in late spring. The rover appears in the photo as a pale dot. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter took the picture last week from 166 miles (267 kilometers) up. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory released the photo Tuesday. The global dust storm prevented sunlight from reaching Opportunity's solar panels, and the rover fell silent in June. Although the skies have cleared considerably, Opportunity has yet to send word to flight controllers. NASA has stepped up efforts to contact Opportunity, but acknowledge the nearly 15-year-old rover may not have survived the prolonged power outage.
Hurricane Harvey: Home Depot, Lowe's stock up on supplies before storm hits  [SEP]  Home Depot (HD) and Lowe’s (LOW) have put emergency plans in motion before the arrival of Hurricane Harvey, which is heading toward the Texas coast. Hurricane Harvey was upgraded from a tropical storm on Thursday afternoon, and the National Hurricane Center warned that it was rapidly building strength. Forecasters believe the storm will become a Category 3 hurricane by the time it makes landfall in Texas late Friday or early Saturday. Local home-improvement retailers are making preparations to stock their shelves and keep stores open. Lowe’s, which has 90 stores in Hurricane Harvey’s projected path, activated its 24/7 emergency command center located in North Carolina. The company has begun shipping truckloads of bottled water to help customers affected by the storm, according to a Lowe’s spokesperson. Lowe’s also has truckloads of generators, flashlights, batteries and plywood heading to the area. Both Lowe’s and Home Depot have backup generators in all of their stores, so they can open as soon as safely possible during power outages. A Home Depot spokesperson told FOX Business that the retailer’s merchandising and supply-chain teams have working together to send supplies to the impact zone. Home Depot has a distribution center near Houston that stocks storm-related products in bulk, allowing supplies to quickly arrive in stores. Shares of Home Depot and Lowe’s were down less than 1% on Thursday. Generac (GNRC), which makes generators, jumped 4.2%.

Israel attacks Syrian launcher that fired rockets thought to have...  [SEP]  JERUSALEM, July 25 (Reuters) - Israeli jets and artillery on Wednesday attacked a site in Syria from where two rockets were launched which were thought to have landed in the Sea of Galilee, close to beachgoers, the military said. After air raid sirens sounded in the south of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, the army said rockets had been fired from Syria towards Israel. They appeared to be stray fire from the fighting inside Syria. "In response to the two rockets launched at Israeli territory from Syria, (Israeli) aircraft targeted the rocket launcher. The area surrounding it was targeted by artillery," an Israeli army statement said. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said police units were searching in the waters of the Sea of Galilee for remnants of the rockets, although nothing had been found initially. "As I was watching the water, I saw something fall in. I didn't see what it was but I saw the spray from the impact," Hasdia Rada, a life guard at one of the lake's beaches, told Israeli commercial TV news. Another man said he heard a whistling sound before an impact. There have been many instances of stray fire landing on the Israeli side of the rocky Golan plateau during years of fighting between Syrian rebels and forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, but a rocket flying between 7-10 kilometres (4-6 miles) and landing in the lake would be the farthest yet. Tensions had risen a day earlier after Israel shot down a Syrian warplane that it said had crossed into airspace above the Israeli-occupied Golan. However, Syrian state media said the plane was targeted by Israel while it was conducting raids in Syrian-controlled air space. There have been days of bombing as Russian-backed Syrian government forces advance on rebel-held positions near the 1974 ceasefire line with Israel. The holdouts include one pocket near the frontier held by a group affiliated to the Islamic State. Israel worries that Assad may defy a U.N. armistice that demilitarised much of the Golan, or allow Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah forces to deploy there once he and his allies retake the Syrian side.

B.C. space sleuth discovers NASA satellite not a ‘piece of space junk’  [SEP]  An amateur astronomer in British Columbia has made a discovery that has gained the attention of NASA. Scott Tilley, a 47-year-old electrical technologist, sneaks time away from his family when he can to search for spy satellites by using radio frequency signals and a contraption of remote control cameras and antennas on the roof of his Roberts Creek home on the Sunshine Coast. He was sleuthing through space on Jan. 20 when he found something unusual. A signal led him to discover a satellite called IMAGE, or Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration. NASA launched the science probe in 2000 to image the Earth’s magnetosphere and produce images of plasma populations. But contact with the probe was lost in 2005 and the mission was abandoned in 2007. “Everybody thought it was dead,” explains Tilley. ”It was no longer talking anymore and it was just a piece of space junk.” He says the signal he found showed the satellite was alive. And it was sending data. READ MORE: NASA to launch first mission to the sun in 2018 READ MORE: New image of B.C. smoke from space taken today With the help of friend and fellow astronomer Cees Bassa, Tilley calculated that IMAGE had been trying to call home for more than a year. But its messages were lost among the din of other chattering satellites. Tilley was thrilled about the finding and wrote about it on his blog and on Twitter. He even sent NASA a message but got no reply. It wasn’t until a few days later, when he reached out to a scientist who had developed IMAGE, when the frenzy erupted. “I had dozens of emails from all the different researchers and people who were involved in IMAGE and they were all very excited,” says Tilley. Then he heard from a mission director at NASA and gladly shared his information. A news release on NASA’s website this week confirmed that IMAGE was found by an unnamed astronomer. “The NASA team has been able to read some basic housekeeping data from the spacecraft, suggesting that at least the main control system is operational,” it said. Scientists and engineers from the agency’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland are to analyze its data over the next two weeks, NASA added, but the satellite’s age poses a problem. “The types of hardware and operating systems used in the IMAGE Mission Operations Center no longer exist, and other systems have been updated several versions beyond what they were at the time, requiring significant reverse-engineering.” The discovery has also been mentioned in Science magazine. Tilley says he hasn’t been offered a job with NASA — even though he’d jump at the chance. But he is happy knowing that NASA would collaborate with a Canadian who has been searching space since he was a kid by fiddling with his father’s short-wave radio. “I’m appreciative of the fact that these very talented people doing an amazing job for all of us would be open-minded enough to listen to somebody just out of the noise.” Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.
Bostonians, New Yorkers can get free bikeshare rides, courtesy of Switzerland  [SEP]  Take a spin around Boston on a Hubway for free, thanks to Switzerland. Photo: Hubway May 1st marks the start of National Bike Month, and you can take a rideshare out for a spin for free, thanks to Switzerland. Yup, the European country is trying to get more Americans to bike. Switzerland Tourism has partnered with Motivate, the company behind bike share systems like Citi Bike, Hubway and more, to bring free bike share rides to four metro areas. From now until the end of May, people in Boston, New York and Jersey City, as well as Chicago and the San Francisco Bay area can take a spin on the bike shares in their cities. The partnership is meant to show people how “convenient, fast and fun cycling can be,” according to Switzerland Tourism. Anyone can send their friends and family an e-postcard through the Switzerland Tourism website at myswitzerland.com/bikes that contains free ride codes for any of the bike share systems. Receiving a postcard also gets you a sweepstakes entry where you could win a trip to Switzerland, and representatives of Switzerland Tourism will also be passing out Swiss chocolate and cheese from Motivate tricycles a few times in each city. Jay Walder, president and CEO of Motivate, said in a statement that “bike share is one of the best ways to explore a city,” and that’s really the motivation behind this promo. Switzerland Tourism hopes to attract some American tourists who want to explore the city on two wheels. “Switzerland isn’t just about skiing and hiking in the Alps,” said Alex Herrmann, director of North America Switzerland Tourism, in a statement. “Switzerland offers 5,600 miles of cycling routes and 2,800 miles of mountain biking trails as part of a program called SwitzerlandMobility.

Watchdog confirms UK findings on nerve agent used on Russian spy  [SEP]  London (United Kingdom) (AFP) - The world's chemical arms watchdog on Thursday said it had confirmed Britain's findings on a nerve agent used in an attack on a former spy last month, which London said came from Russia. Samples tested by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) "confirm the findings of the United Kingdom relating to the identity of the toxic chemical," according to a summary of the Hague-based group's report. It added that "the toxic chemical was of high purity". In a declassified summary of its findings, the OPCW did not make any assessment on who carried out the March 4 attack on former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury that also injured a police officer. Britain and allies including the United States have blamed Moscow, sparking furious denials and provoking an international row resulting in the expulsions of diplomats from all sides. The OPCW did not name the chemical, saying that information and its structure would be in a full classified report available to signatory states of the organisation. Britain named it as Novichok, a group of powerful and deadly chemical compounds reportedly developed by the Soviet government in the 1970s and 1980s. Prime Minister Theresa May's government has said Russia was known to have used it, and pointed to the country's pattern of "reckless behaviour", including the annexation of Crimea. Russia has strongly denied any involvement, and insists it has destroyed all of its chemical weapons. Skripal moved to Britain in a spy swap in 2010 and settled in Salisbury, and his daughter Yulia was visiting from Russia when they were poisoned, possibly on his front door. Despite initial fears that they would not survive, Yulia Skripal was released from hospital to an undisclosed location earlier this week, while her father is said to be improving rapidly.
While Trump made pals with Democrats, Twitter became Cruz's enemy this week  [SEP]  While Donald Trump made pals with Democrats, Twitter became Ted Cruz's enemy this week A mega-storm devastated the Caribbean and parts of Florida, President Donald Trump had dinner with Democrats Nancy and Chuck at the White House, and someone using Ted Cruz's Twitter account liked a porn tweet in the middle of the night — that's the week that was in Washington in a nutshell. Hurricane Irma has dominated the news here in the US this week, as it's cut a destructive path from the French Antilles, through the Virgin Islands, across Puerto Rico and Cuba and finally into Florida. The category-5 storm caused 90 per cent damage and destruction in some of the places it's hit, and they will take years to recover. Shell-shocked residents and tourists are still being evacuated from some of the islands affected, while in Florida, millions remain without power and the Keys have been all but flattened. The most horrific result of the hurricane was the death of eight elderly nursing home residents after the air conditioning was knocked out to their care home north of Miami because the power was off. Mr Trump and first lady Melania have visited Fort Myers and Naples, where the storm made landfall on the state's west coast. The President's approval rating has jumped, seemingly as a result of the administration's handling of both Harvey and Irma. He's also been tweeting mostly about the storms, rather than causing them with his habitual early morning Twitter rants. If there's heavy political weather in the making, however, it surrounds the President's recent overtures to the Democrats. On Wednesday night he hosted minority leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi at the White House where, in the interests of bipartisanship, they discussed immigration and tax reform and infrastructure spending. The Democrats emerged claiming a deal had been struck to protect the rights of so-called Dreamers, along with a border security package excluding the proposed wall along the Mexican border. And the President's biggest ally, Sean Hannity? Well, he still blames Mitch: Confused? Yeah, even Joe Manchin is — and he was at the dinner. This gem from The Washington Post: Such is the dilemma facing Democrats in this moment of Trumpian outreach: the perks are enticing, but they are not entirely sure what they're dipping their spoon into. Meanwhile, Democrats are turning back the clock. First, Bernie Sanders introduced a universal healthcare bill (with the support of many Democrats jockeying for poll position in 2020). And then, Hillary Clinton returned to the public spotlight, travelling the country to sell her new book, What Happened. … that was much to Mr Trump's dismay. The book, perhaps surprisingly, has had pretty good reviews and is seen as a more authentic piece of work than her previous ones. It's filled with quick quips, and funny inspirational quotes, like this one: We caught up with Jon Allen, co-author of Shattered, an insider's take on Mrs Clinton's campaign, and compared it to her own book. "If you like Hillary Clinton and you're interested in Hillary Clinton, this will add to what you understand about her. No doubt. Certainly on the personal level," he said. "But there's also a fair amount of self-exoneration that goes on and it's hard because you mix these things where there's a line where she says, 'Well, I take full responsibility' but then the next 10 pages are about everybody else that's to blame. "It is hard to get through this book without thinking to yourself that she remains out of touch, and peevish and unforgiving." You can hear the full conversation on our weekly podcast (shameless plug). It's worth a listen. Now on to tech troubles US pollies are having a tricky time with technology this week. First, a pornographic tweet was "liked" by Ted Cruz's official twitter account. Ted and his team claim it was a "mistake" not by Ted but by a staffer … oh dear. The interview was as weird as the headline and included this bizarre exchange with CNN's Dana Bash: Former Arkansas governor and 2016 Republican also-ran Mike Huckabee came up with the worst joke following the scandal: And then Chuck Schumer tweeted this: Maybe it's time for Kid Rock to finally announce his bid for Senate … at least for the sake of somewhere else to look. In other notable news this week: 1) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is under investigation for his alleged request to use a government jet to take him and his wife on their honeymoon in Europe earlier this summer, according to ABC News. In a column in the Washington Post, well-known conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin labelled the pair the "Marie Antoinette and King Louis the XVI" of the administration. Mr Mnuchin's net worth is estimated at more than $100 million. 2) The White House suggested making disparaging remarks about the President is a "fire-able offence" after African-American ESPN presenter Jemele Hill called the President a "white supremacist" on Twitter. 3) Alex Jones, the well-known conspiracy theorist, proclaimed sources told him Mr Trump was getting drugged each night before bed by staff. I mean. I can't even. 4) Steve Bannon, now outside the White House, is gearing up for a war … with Republicans, according to Politico. The former chief strategist is planning primary challenges to establishment Republicans ahead of the 2018 mid-terms. It could be a costly exercise, especially when this week Democrats picked up a pair of state seats in areas Mr Trump won in 2016. 5) The weird story about diplomats in Cuba just got even more bizarre. 6) Mr Trump met with Republican senator Tim Scott in the Oval Office to discuss his response to Charlottesville. Here's the press release from the White House: Here's hoping next week doesn't come with a natural disaster attached, particularly given that all of the world's leaders will be busy at the UN general assembly. It will be Mr Trump's first one, and you can be sure North Korea will be at the centre of discussions.

Sony to become world's No.1 music publisher with US$2.3 billion EMI deal  [SEP]  related media assets (image or videos) available. Click to see the gallery. 2 related media assets (image or videos) available. Click to see the gallery. Sony Corp said on Tuesday it would pay about US$2.3 billion to gain control of EMI, becoming the world's biggest music publisher in an industry that has found new life in streaming services. TOKYO: Sony Corp said on Tuesday it would pay about US$2.3 billion to gain control of EMI, becoming the world's biggest music publisher in an industry that has found new life in streaming services. The acquisition, which gives Sony a catalogue of more than 2 million songs from artists such as Kanye West, Sam Smith and Sia, is the biggest so far by new CEO Kenichiro Yoshida. The deal seeks to take advantage of the rapid growth in streaming music services like Spotify and Apple Music which has driven a recovery in the music industry. It also fits in with Yoshida's mission to make revenue streams more stable after his predecessor engineered a major turnaround that shifted the firm's focus away from low-margin consumer electronics to entertainment content and image sensors. "This investment in content intellectual property is a key stepping stone for our long-term growth," he told a news conference. EMI currently commands 15 percent of the music publishing industry which with the current Sony ATV business would make the Japanese entertainment and electronics giant the industry leader with market share of 26 percent, a company spokesman said. Other major players include Universal Music Group and Warner Music Group although their market share figures were not immediately available. Under the deal, Sony, which already runs EMI Music Publishing, will lift its ownership to roughly 90 percent from 30 percent currently by buying Mubadala Investment Company's holding. "The rise in digital streaming is also expanding songwriter royalty revenues, with Sony capturing value as manager of the copyrights backed by direct deals with the likes of Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play, SoundCloud and YouTube," Macquarie analyst Damian Thong said in a report. Yoshida, who took the helm in April, said his strategy was to prioritise stable cash flow while minimising the impact of volatile sales cycles of game consoles and other electronics gadgets. In line with the strategy, Sony gave no operating profit target for the group in a new three-year business plan that the company announced on Tuesday. Instead, the company said it aims to generate a total of 2 trillion yen (US$18 billion) or more in cash flow over the next three years, up by 500 billion yen from the last three years. Gaming and image sensors are set to remain the biggest profit contributors. Sony sees operating profit at its semiconductor business, which includes image sensors, growing to 160-200 billion yen in the financial year ending March 2021, compared with a prediction of 100 billion yen for this year. Extending the sensors' applications beyond smartphones into automotive areas would be key, Yoshida said. But operating profit at its video games unit is expected to to fall to between 130 billion yen and 170 billion yen, down from the 190 billion yen forecast for this financial year. At that time, its PlayStation 4 would be nearing the end of a game console's typical life cycle. Sony's shares finished 2 percent lower, hurt in part by the weaker outlook for its gaming business.
K'taka polls: Re-polling ordered at a booth in Hebbal  [SEP]  [India], May 12 (ANI): The Election Commission has ordered re-polling in Karnataka's Hebbal assembly constituency's polling station Number 2 as the polling was stopped earlier in the day due to Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) failure. In the morning, the voting was suspended here after voters complained that VVPAT receipt was different from the vote they cast on the EVM. As per reports till now, 164 polling units, 157 control units and 470 VVPATs malfunctioned across the state. The election in two constituencies, Jayanagar and Rajarajeshwari Nagar, both in Bengaluru was postponed earlier. In Jayanagar, the polling was also deferred due to the death of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate, B N Vijay Kumar, on May 4. In Rajarajeshwari Nagar, the polling was postponed after a bundle of fake voter identity cards was found from a flat in Bengaluru's Jalahalli locality by the EC officials on May 8. Tight security arrangements were made to ensure smooth and peaceful single-phase polling in 222 constituencies, including 36 reserved for the Scheduled Castes (SC) and 15 for the Scheduled Tribes (ST) and 26 in Bengaluru.

Ex-Iowa State golfer found dead at course; suspect charged  [SEP]  AMES, Iowa (AP) - A former Iowa State University golfer was found dead at a golf course Monday, and a man was charged with murder. Police said in a news release that 22-year-old Celia Barquin Arozamena was found dead Monday at Coldwater Golf Links in Ames and officers determined she had died after being assaulted. They said 22-year-old Collin Daniel Richards was charged with first-degree murder. Additional details about the incident weren't immediately available. Police said Richards has no known address. Police were called to the golf course around 10:20 a.m. Monday after golfers found a golf bag with no one around it. Officers found a body some distance from the bag. Barquin Arozamena was the 2018 Big 12 champion and Iowa State Female Athlete of the Year. The university said the native of Puente San Miguel, Spain, was finishing her civil engineering degree this semester after exhausting her eligibility at Iowa State in 2017-2018. She was one of the most accomplished players in Cyclone golf history, the university said. In April, she became the second women's golfer at Iowa State to earn medalist honors at a conference tournament when claiming the 2018 Big 12 Championship. She did it with a three-shot victory. Barquin Arozamena, who was ranked No. 69 nationally by Golfweek, ended her career as a Cyclone with a fourth-straight NCAA Regional appearance and earned All-Big 12 Team honors for the third time - the second player in Iowa State's history to do so. She became the third Cyclone women's golfer to compete in the U.S. Women's Open Championship, the university said. Iowa State President Wendy Wintersteen said in a statement on Twitter that she was "deeply saddened to learn of the tragic death" of Barquin Arozamena, describing her as a "dedicated civil engineering student" and an "acclaimed golfer with a bright future." Head women's golf coach Christie Martens said in a release that Barquin Arozamena was "loved by all her teammates and friends" and was an "outstanding representative of our school." "We will never forget her competitive drive to be the best and her passion for life," Martens said.
U.S. sanctions whack Russia's rouble, Turkey's lira free-falls  [SEP]  LONDON (Reuters) - Alarm bells were ringing on Thursday as harsh new U.S. sanctions drove drove down Russia’s rouble Turkey’s lira plunged as worries mounted that Ankara was sliding towards a full-blown economic crisis. A rally in Chinese stocks had helped Asia offset the latest escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade war overnight after Beijing matched the latest U.S. sanctions, but too much was going on nearby for Europe to remain unscathed. London’s FTSE , Frankfurt’s DAX and Paris’ CAC40 were down 0.7 percent, 0.3 percent and 0.4 percent respectively, while German government bonds rose in broad grab for safety. Wall Street futures pointed to a steady start to New York trading but that was deceptive. The main fireworks were in the currency markets. The Russian rouble sank after Washington said it would impose fresh sanctions because it had determined that Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian agent and his daughter in Britain, something the Kremlin denies. There were also reports of a new U.S. Senate bill that, if passed, would impose even more widespread punishments for meddling in U.S. elections. The rouble duly slid to its lowest since late 2016, 66.1 roubles to the dollar and left the Russian currency down almost 4 percent lighter than it had been 24 hours previously.. “I’m surprised that the market, in retrospect, was quite complacent about this risk,” said North Asset Management portfolio manager Peter Kisler, though he was relieved the new sanctions hadn’t flagged a ban on Russian sovereign debt or banks for the time being. Turkey’s lira, bond and stocks markets were taking even more of a pounding after meetings between officials in Washington looked to have made little progress in mending a row over Ankara’s jailing of an American pastor. The lira touched a record low of 5.44 against the dollar, weakening some 2.5 percent from Wednesday’s close. There was widespread selling in the country’s bond markets and Istanbul stocks dropped 1 percent too. “We think Turkey may need to approach the IMF or seek other external support. Otherwise, capital-control measures seem to be a distinct possibility,” said fund manager Lombard Odier’s chief investment strategist Salman Ahmed. Asia had been much brighter. Shanghai blue chips closed up 2.5 percent after talk of possible government support for home-grown technology companies, the latest in a series of growth-boosting measures rolled out by Beijing as the trade dispute worsens. Hopes for more Chinese infrastructure spending underpinned industrial resources, including iron ore and copper. The gains in Chinese stocks helped MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares reverse early losses to gain 0.5 percent, though Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.2 percent, in part because core machinery orders fell. Shares in Mazda Motor Corp, Suzuki Motor Corp and Yamaha Motor Co also fell on news they conducted improper fuel economy and emissions tests on their vehicles. Japan will try to avert steep tariffs on its car exports and fend off U.S. demands for a free-trade agreement at talks in Washington later. Early on Thursday, China’s state broadcaster said the country must counteract U.S. tariffs and that Beijing had the confidence to protect its own interests as well as the means to do so. China had already announced additional tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. imports from fuel to autos. The tariffs will apply to billions of dollars in U.S. gasoline, diesel and other oil products, though not crude. The oil market took the news hard on Wednesday, suffering losses of more than 3 percent. Prices steadied a little on Thursday, with U.S. crude edging down 13 cents to $66.80 per barrel and Brent flat at $72.27. Back in the FX markets, it wasn’t only emerging-market currencies that were struggling. The pound wallowed at its lowest against the dollar and euro in almost a year as fears remained that Britain might leave the European Union without a deal on trade. Traders reported a significant increase in investors hedging against a no-deal Brexit, an event that could send sterling into free fall and hurt the economy by raising trade barriers with Britain’s biggest export market. Sterling was last trading at $1.2893, having dropped 0.4 percent overnight. The Japanese yen seemed to be catching a bid as a safe haven, with the dollar easing to 111.11 yen after stretching as high as 111.44 on Wednesday. The euro was subdued at $1.1590, while the dollar index was up at 95.282. The New Zealand dollar dropped 1.4 percent to a two-year low at $0.6641 after the country’s central bank pledged to keep rates at record lows well into 2020. “The risk of rate moves over the next 12 months is weighted more towards cuts than hikes, and financial markets will price the risk accordingly,” said Kiwibank’s chief economist, Jarrod Kerr. “The good news here is interest rates and exchange rates will remain lower for much longer, assisting growth.”
Supreme Court Blocks Challenge to Texas Redistricting  [SEP]  Yesteday, the Supreme Court blocked a ruling from three judges in Texas that invalidated two Congressional districts as un-Constitutional. The vote was 5-4. This is the background. Texas has been embroiled in six years of litigation over the congressional districts drawn after the 2010 Census. A federal court invalidated two of Texas’ congressional districts on Tuesday, concluding that they violated the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act by diluting the voting power of minorities. In a 107-page ruling — part of a long-running legal battle — a three-judge panel of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas found that District 27, which includes Corpus Christi, had been drawn to deny voters in a heavily Hispanic county “their opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice,” and that race had been the primary factor in drawing District 35, a narrow strip that stretches from San Antonio to Austin. The judges, however, upheld the validity of other districts, including ones that had been challenged in Houston and in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. The panel, in San Antonio, ruled that state officials had adopted the map in question in 2013 as part of a deliberate strategy to maintain “discrimination or unconstitutional effects” while preventing voters from challenging those effects. If Texas legislators do not begin a redistricting process, the court will hold a hearing on Sept. 5 to discuss remedies. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton appealed and Justice Alito halted the order for redistricting. In a one-sentence order issued this afternoon, Justice Samuel Alito blocked an order by a federal district court in Texas that had invalidated two congressional districts in that state. Officials in Texas had asked the district court to put its order on hold to give it time to appeal to the Supreme Court, but the lower court had declined to do so. Last week state officials went to the Supreme Court, where they found a more sympathetic audience in Alito, who handles emergency appeals from the geographic area that includes Texas. Today’s order – which came from Alito himself, rather than the full nine-member court – relieves the state of its obligation to comply with the deadlines imposed by the district court. Instead, Alito instructed the challengers to respond to the state’s request by the afternoon of September 5; the order indicates that the district court’s order will remain on hold until the response is received and either the Supreme Court or he takes further action on the state’s request. The Supreme Court on Tuesday blocked rulings from a federal court in Texas that had called for revisions to congressional and state legislative districts in the state after the court found that the districts violated the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court’s brief order, in a long-running dispute over legislative maps drawn after the 2010 census, made it more likely that the 2018 election will be held using maps rejected by a three-judge panel of the Federal District Court for the Western District of Texas, in San Antonio. The Supreme Court’s order will remain in place while it considers the state’s appeal. The vote was 5 to 4 and divided along ideological lines, with the court’s more conservative members in the majority. Two things to keep in mind here. The idea of “minority-majority” districts is simply a racist idea that has been used by Democrats and Republicans to create a political spoils system for minority politicians. The second point is that courts are increasingly saying that party=race and so a map that would be completely legal if it were all white suddenly becomes illegal because of the degree to which black voters are in thrall to the Democrat party. The Democrats are carrying out a concentrated attack on redistricting because they hold a distinct minority of state houses and governor’s mansions and have been on the losing end too often. So they are attacking the process at every point. The Texas case uses race, there is a case in Wisconsin that tries to ensure districts mirror the voter make-up of the state. Essentially, the Wisconsin case tries to make party registration an impermissible criteria in redistricting…while keeping race and ethnicity. The only legal consideration in constructing districts should be ‘one-man-one-vote.’ Beyond that it is a political and a partisan issue.

The Latest: UK leader congratulates royals on birth of son  [SEP]  LONDON (AP) — The Latest on the royal baby birth (all times local): British Prime Minister Theresa May has offered “warmest congratulations” to Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge on the birth of their new son. May says that “I wish them great happiness for the future.” The couple’s Kensington Palace office says Kate gave birth at 11:01 a.m. (1001 GMT; 6:01 a.m. EDT) to a boy weighing eight pounds, seven ounces (3.8 kilograms). The baby is the couple’s third child and is fifth in line to the throne. The news brought cheers from dedicated royal-watchers outside London’s St. Mary’s Hospital, where a self-appointed town crier proclaimed the birth. The words “it’s a boy” were flashed in lights around the top of London’s BT Tower, which can be seen for miles around. Kensington Palace says the Duchess of Cambridge has given birth to her third child, a boy weighing 8 pounds, 7 ounces (3.8 kilograms). The palace says the child was born at 11:01 a.m. (1001 GMT; 6:01 a.m. EDT), a few hours after Kate was admitted to London’s St. Mary’s Hospital in labor. Prince William was present for the birth of his son, who is fifth in line to the throne. The palace says “the queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry and members of both families have been informed and are delighted with the news.” Kensington Palace says Prince William’s wife, the Duchess of Cambridge has entered a London hospital to give birth to the couple’s third child. The former Kate Middleton traveled by car on Monday morning to the private Lindo Wing of St. Mary’s Hospital in central London. The palace says she was in “the early stages of labor.” The gender of the baby hasn’t been announced. The couple, who married in 2011, has two other children: Prince George, 4, and two-year-old Princess Charlotte. Both were born at the same hospital, as were William and his younger brother Harry.
Iran says U.N. report on its ballistic missile tests 'unrealistic'  [SEP]  Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) conducted ballistic missile tests in early March and called them a demonstration of its non-nuclear deterrent power. The United States and its European allies said that by testing nuclear-capable missiles, Tehran had defied a U.N. Security Council resolution and urged U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to tackle the matter. Reuters reported on Thursday that a confidential report by Ban had found Iran's missile tests to be inconsistent "with the constructive spirit" of the 2015 deal under which Iran curbed sensitive nuclear activity and won sanctions relief in return. "We suggest that Mr. Ban and his colleagues... produce a realistic report...They should not yield to political pressures from some members of the (Security) Council," Tasnim quoted an unnamed Foreign Ministry official as saying. Ban's report stopped short of calling the missile launches a "violation" of Security Council Resolution 2231, which endorsed the nuclear agreement that defused Iranian-Western tensions which had raised fears of a wider Middle East war. His report said it was up to the Security Council to decide if Iran violated Resolution 2231 which "calls upon" Iran to refrain for up to eight years from activity related to ballistic missiles with cones that could accommodate a nuclear warhead. Iran has consistently denied its missiles are designed to carry an atomic device. Ban's report said Iran had stressed that it had not undertaken "any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons." The Council is due to discuss Ban's report on July 18. Tehran has accused the United States of failing to meet its commitments under the nuclear deal, saying Washington should do more to lift its own sanctions affecting banks so businesses feel confident of being able to invest in Iran without penalty. "I hope the Reuters report is not true ... I suggest that Mr Ban give a fair report ... in which he also mentions America is not fulfilling its commitments under the deal," the official said told the Tasnim agency. The German government, responding to reports by its spy service that Iran has been trying to acquire nuclear technology in Germany, said on Friday certain forces in Iran may be trying to undermine the nuclear deal. International sanctions on Tehran were lifted in January under the nuclear deal, but current U.S. policy bars foreign banks from clearing dollar-based transactions with Iran through U.S. banks.

Man arrested trying to steal the Magna Carta from UK cathedral  [SEP]  LONDON (AP) — A man suspected of trying to steal a Magna Carta from its display case at Salisbury Cathedral has been arrested after he was wrestled to the ground by cathedral employees, British authorities said Friday. Wiltshire Police said cathedral alarms sounded Thursday afternoon in the southwestern English city when a person armed with a hammer tried to smash the glass box surrounding the Magna Carta. The Magna Carta — Latin for Great Charter — is considered the founding document of English law and civil liberties, a document that influenced the shapers of the U.S. Constitution. The document, granted by King John in 1215, established the principle that the king was subject to the law, rather than above it. It also stipulated that "no free man shall be seized or imprisoned ... except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land." The Magna Carta on display at the cathedral is one of four surviving originals. The dean of the cathedral said the suspect was able to smash through one of two protective glass screens housing the precious document. The Rev. Canon Nicholas Papadopulos praised "courageous" staff members who he said were able to restrain the man for 12 minutes before authorities got to the scene. "He walked out of the Chapter House and tried to leave the cathedral via our work yard and he was detained there and restrained until the police arrived," the dean said. The 45-year-old suspect was arrested on suspicion of attempted theft, possession of a weapon and criminal damage, police said. He has not been identified or charged. Police said the Magna Carta was not damaged and no one was hurt during the incident. But, with its display case damaged, the cathedral said the Magna Carta will be taken out of public view for the moment. "We are very sorry that, for the time being, our copy of Magna Carta will not be available to visitors and will have it back on display as soon as we can," the cathedral said. The other originals are at Lincoln Cathedral and the British Library in London, which has two in its collection. Salisbury Cathedral has also been in the news recently because two Russians accused of carrying out the March nerve agent attack on ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia claimed during a TV interview in September that they had traveled to Salisbury to see its "famous cathedral," not to poison anyone. In addition to the rare Magna Carta, the cathedral is known for having the tallest cathedral spire in Britain. Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

NASA's Parker Solar Probe Breaks Record for Closest and Fastest Approach to Sun  [SEP]  Here Comes the Sun The Parker Solar Probe, humanity's first-ever mission into the Sun's outer atmosphere, or corona, has become the closest human-made object to ever approach our star. The space agency said in a statement on Monday that Parker passed the current record of 26.55 million miles (42.73 million km) from the Sun's surface. Yet, the spacecraft is gradually shrinking its orbit around the sun, with the final objective being 3.83 million miles (6.16 million km) from the surface. The previous record was set by the German-American Helios 2 probe in April 1976. "It's been just 78 days since Parker Solar Probe launched, and we've now come closer to our star than any other spacecraft in history," said Project Manager Andy Driesman. It also emerged on Monday that the mission set the speed record for spacecraft traveling relative to the Sun, surpassing 153,454 mph (shy of 247,000 km/h) and breaking the record set by Helios 2 back in 1976. The Parker Solar Probe blasted off from Cape Canaveral air force station in Florida on August 13. During its 7-year mission, the probe will complete 24 orbits of the Sun, coming within 3.8 million miles of its surface, and dip into the corona, the plasmic aura that is even hotter than the surface. The craft will seek to unlock some of mysteries about our Sun's behavior by sampling the corona, the birthplace of solar flares and other violent events, and get a better understanding of how solar winds are formed. NASA expects to get the first batch of data in December, but the spacecraft has another mission: it holds a memory card with the names of over 1.1 million people who signed up to "travel" to the Sun. The probe is equipped with a carbon heat shield to prevent it from roasting.
Iran's top leader endorses warning over oil supplies  [SEP]  TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran's top leader has endorsed a warning made earlier by the country's president over Mideast oil supplies. State TV reported Saturday that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, meeting with Iranian diplomats, praised the remarks by Hassan Rouhani and called them "a policy and attitude by the system." Khamenei, who has final say on all state matters, did not elaborate. Earlier in July, Rouhani said that if Iran's crude oil exports were threatened, the rest of the Middle East's would be as well. Rouhani did not elaborate, but Iran long has asserted it could shut down the Strait of Hormuz that a third of all oil traded by sea passes through. The U.S. pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal in May and said it wanted allies to stop buying Iranian crude entirely.
Trump Disbands 2 Business Advisory Councils After String Of Resignations  [SEP]  After a string of executives quit President Trump's manufacturing council over his controversial remarks about Charlottesville violence, the president declared he is disbanding two economic advisory panels that included the heads of some of America's largest companies. Trump said in a tweet that he is ending the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative and his Strategic and Policy Forum "rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople" that made up those groups. "Thank you all!" the president added. The move came shortly after two executives — 3M's Inge Thulin and Campbell Soup's Denise Morrison — said Wednesday that they would be leaving the manufacturing panel established by Trump, who has long touted the need to support American manufacturing jobs. "Racism and murder are unequivocally reprehensible and are not morally equivalent to anything else that happened in Charlottesville", Campbell Soup CEO Morrison said, referring to Trump's much-criticized response to the white supremacist rally in which a counter-protester was killed. 3M President and CEO Thulin said his decision to leave followed reflection on the values of "sustainability, diversity and inclusion." They were among eight executives who quit Trump's manufacturing council this week. Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier, who is African-American, was the first to announce his departure in the wake of Charlottesville, saying Monday that "I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism." Later that day, Under Armour's Kevin Plank and Intel's Brian Krzanich said they too would be leaving. Tuesday saw the departures of Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing; Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO; and Thea Lee, the AFL-CIO's deputy chief of staff. "I'm resigning from the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative because it's the right thing for me to do," Paul wrote in a tweet Tuesday morning. Over the summer, Tesla founder Elon Musk left both the manufacturing council and the Strategic and Policy Forum, announcing that he disagreed with Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris climate accord. Disney CEO Bob Iger also resigned over Trump's climate policy. Former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick quit the forum in February, citing Trump's executive order on immigration. Trump's decision to wind down the two groups came despite his defiant tone about the recent resignations earlier this week, as criticism swirled around his comment that "many sides" were at fault in Charlottesville. On Monday, Trump said, "Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Council, he will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!" On Tuesday, Trump stated, "For every CEO that drops out of the Manufacturing Council, I have many to take their place. Grandstanders should not have gone on. JOBS!" When the council was formed back in January, the White House said the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative would allow the president to meet with "some of the world's most successful and creative business leaders to share their experiences and gain their insights."
Canadian Senate Votes To Make National Anthem Gender-Neutral –  [SEP]  On Wednesday, the Canadian Senate passed bill C-210, which aims to change the lyrics in “O Canada,” the Canadian national anthem, to make it gender-neutral. The bill had first been introduced in the Senate in June 2016. The bill was introduced as a private member’s bill by member of Parliament Mauril Belanger; he is no longer a member of the Canadian Parliament as he died in 2016 after fighting Lou Gehrig’s disease. The bill stipulates that the lyric, “True patriot love in all thy sons command” be altered to “True patriot love in all of us command.” – READ MORE With renewed pressure brought to bear by President Donald Trump on illegal aliens in the U.S., Canada is warning immigrants here that illegally crossing into Canada is not a free ticket to permanent residency and they can still be deported back to their point of origin if they steal across America’s northern border. With many illegal immigrants becoming uneasy over their status in the U.S., some are eyeing a trip northward to a country many are told will accept everyone and give them lots of free stuff to boot. But Ahmed Hussen, Canada’s immigration minister, recently warned illegals that they shouldn’t waltz into Canada and necessarily expect to get cradle to the grave freebies, according to the New York Times. Hussen, who was an immigrant to Canada himself, warned illegals that while Canada is a welcoming country, they won’t take everyone who illegally crosses into the country. “We don’t want people to illegally enter our border, and doing so is not a free ticket to Canada,” Hussen said . “We are saying, ‘You will be apprehended, screened, detained, fingerprinted, and if you can’t establish a genuine claim, you will be denied refugee protection and removed.’” – READ MORE When President Trump issued a travel ban on citizens from seven Muslim terrorist hotbeds shortly after taking office, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was incensed. “To those fleeing persecution, terror and war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength,” Trudeau wrote on January 28, 2017. But in 2018, the young prime minister is singing a different tune. The Canadian government, worried that Salvadorans will flood across the border into Canada to avoid deportation, is now trying to discourage them from crossing into the country — as thousands of Haitians did last year after they were threatened with the loss of similar protection. “The government announced that it was planning to send Pablo Rodriguez, a Spanish-speaking member of Parliament, to California in the coming days to speak to community groups, lawyers and Spanish-language media,” the Miami Herald reported. “His message is simple: If you don’t qualify for refugee or asylum status, don’t try to cross into Canada.” – READ MORE
6.9-magnitude earthquake kills at least 22 in Indonesia  [SEP]  Aug. 5 (UPI) -- A 6.9-magnitude earthquake struck Indonesia on Sunday, killing at lest 22 people on Lombok Island, Indonesian officials said. The temblor hit around 6:45 p.m. near Loloan and was followed by a series of aftershocks ranging from 4.7 to 5.4 in magnitude, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The epicenter was about 20 miles northwest of Labuan and 30 miles northeast of Mataram. The Indonesian Red Cross said four volunteers sustained injuries and were taken to a local hospital. At least 50 people sustained injuries. The team reported parts of the island was without electricity as emergency officials worked to evacuate people. Meteorologists said the earthquakes should generate increased waves by up to 5.5 inches. A tsunami warning was canceled. Sunday's earthquake comes a week after a 6.4-magnitude temblor stranded more than 500 hikers on an Indonesian volcano on Lombok Island. The country's Joint Evacuation Team evacuated the hikers from Mount Rinjani on Tuesday.
BREAKING: Iraqi forces CHARGE into Mosul airport in a bid to ERADICATE ISIS militants  [SEP]  Battle for Western Mosul is underway as Iraqi forces charge Mosul airport It comes days after Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi launched an offensive to retake the western part of Mosul from the jihadi militants. Reports confirm the country’s elite Counter-Terrorism Forces and the Federal police have raided buildings in Western Mosul to assassinate jihadis. At least 3,000 terrorists are thought to be in western Mosul, with leading experts predicting a tougher battle between Coalition forces and the Islamic militants.
Palestinian Central Council votes to end recognition of Israel  [SEP]  Jan. 15 (UPI) -- The Palestinian Central Council has voted to end Palestine's recognition of Israel until Israel recognizes the Palestinian state. The central council also voted to cease security cooperation with Israel. Members of the Palestine Liberation Organization's policy body met in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Monday to discuss how to respond to actions taken by Israel and the United States. PLO leaders are upset with President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's official capital. On Monday, the central council issued a statement backing Palestine President Mahmoud Abbas, who blamed Trump and Israel for undermining the peace process. Abbas also accused Trump of threatening to close the PLO's diplomatic outposts in Washington, D.C. "Today is the day that the Oslo Accords end. Israel killed them," Abbas said on Sunday, according to Haaretz. "We are an authority without any authority, and an occupation without any cost. Trump threatens to cut funding to the authority because negotiations have failed. When the hell did negotiations start?!" The central council's latest statement echoed the speech made by Abbas over the weekend. The body said Trump and the United States could no longer serve as the mediator of peace negotiations between Palestine and Israel. "He's taken us hundreds of miles back," Qais Abd al-Karim, a Palestinian official who attended Monday's meeting, told the Washington Post. "The Trump decision on Jerusalem completely destroyed the immediate prospects of any peace process." The council also called for the nonviolent protest of Israel's occupation of Palestinian lands to continue with the financial and political support of other Arab nations.
U.S. service member killed in surprise raid in Yemen targeting al-Qaida  [SEP]  The U.S. military says a service member has been killed and three others wounded in a raid in Yemen targeting a local al-Qaida affiliate. U.S. Central Command said in a statement Sunday that another service member was injured in a "hard landing" in a nearby location. It says the aircraft was unable to fly afterward and "was then intentionally destroyed in place." It says 14 fighters from al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula were killed in the assault and that U.S. service members captured "information that will likely provide insight into the planning of future terror plots." Yemeni security and tribal officials say the assault in central Bayda province killed three senior al-Qaida leaders. The surprise dawn attack in Bayda province killed Abdul-Raouf al-Dhahab, Sultan al-Dhahab, and Seif al-Nims, they said. The al-Dhahab family is considered an ally of al-Qaida, which security forces say is concentrated in Bayda province. A third family member, Tarek al-Dhahab, was killed in a previous U.S. drone strike years ago. It was not immediately clear whether the family members were actual members of al-Qaida. The fighting lasted around 45 minutes and the U.S. troops killed or wounded some two dozen men, including some Saudis present at the site, according to the Yemeni officials — who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief journalists. U.S. military officials contacted by The Associated Press had no immediate comment but said they were looking into the report. Just over a week ago, suspected U.S. drone strikes killed three other alleged al-Qaida operatives in Bayda province in what was the first-such killings reported in the country since Donald Trump assumed the U.S. presidency. The tribal officials said the Americans were looking for al-Qaida leader Qassim al-Rimi, adding that they captured and departed with at least two unidentified individuals. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, long seen by Washington as among the most dangerous branches of the global terror network, has exploited the chaos of Yemen's civil war, seizing territory in the south and east. The war began in 2014, when Shiite Houthi rebels and their allies swept down from the north and captured the capital, Sanaa. A Saudi-led military coalition has been helping government forces battle the rebels for nearly two years.
Trump to pardon convicted ex-VP Dick Cheney aide Scooter Libby: Source  [SEP]  WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump plans to pardon I. Lewis “Scooter” Libby, a former top aide to Vice-President Dick Cheney, according to a person familiar with the president’s decision. The person said the announcement could come as early as Friday. The person, who wasn’t authorized to discuss the decision ahead of its public announcement and demanded anonymity, said the pardon has been under consideration at the White House for months. The plans were first reported by ABC News. Libby, Cheney’s former chief of staff, was convicted of lying to investigators and obstruction of justice following the 2003 leak of CIA operative Valerie Plame. President George W. Bush later commuted Libby’s 30-month prison sentence, but didn’t issue a pardon despite intense pressure from Cheney. No one was ever charged for the leak. Since then, the Libby case has been criticized by conservatives, who argue he was the victim of an overly zealous and politically motivated prosecution by a special counsel. Another twist is that the special counsel, Patrick Fitzgerald, was appointed by James Comey, deputy attorney general at the time. Comey later became head of the FBI, but was fired by Trump, and has since written a book highly critical of the president. White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway on Friday declined to confirm Trump’s plans for a pardon. Still, she said, “many people think that Scooter Libby was the victim of a special counsel gone amok.” Asked if a pardon was about Comey, Conway said no. The move would mark the third pardon by Trump. He granted one last year for former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was awaiting sentencing for contempt of court. Trump also has pardoned a U.S. Navy sailor, who was convicted after taking photos of classified portions of a submarine. Conservative criticism of the special counsel in the Plame case echoes critiques of Robert Mueller’s Russia probe. Mueller is special counsel leading an investigation into Russian election interference, possible co-ordination with Trump associates and potential obstruction of justice by the president. Trump has called that probe a “witch hunt.”
'You can't lose 'em all': 44-year-old prophecy finally coming true for Caps fans | Sports  [SEP]  Jimmy Patterson was a fresh-faced 22-year-old in the stands at the old Capital Center in October 1974 when the expansion Washington Capitals won their first NHL game. As he was leaving, an elderly man from Brooklyn told Patterson he'd always get to say he saw the Capitals' first win. The man smiled and added, "You can't lose 'em all." Forty-plus years, more than 3,000 games and 27 unsuccessful playoff runs later, Patterson and legions of longtime Capitals fans finally have a reason to believe that. Many who watched Wednesday night at an arena watch party far from Game 7 in Tampa Bay took to the steps of the National Portrait Gallery to celebrate the Capitals' first trip to the Stanley Cup Final since 1998. Game 1 in Las Vegas against the Golden Knights is Monday night. "It's been really gratifying," said Patterson, now 65. "It feels a lot different, and it's a weird feeling." Filling the area, fans chanted, "We want the Cup," "We want Vegas" and "DC! DC!" in an outpouring of joy decades and crushing losses in the making. Alex Ovechkin's Capitals are the first Washington team in the major four professional sports leagues to reach the final in a generation. To get this far, they had to not only outlast the Lightning but survive longtime playoff nemesis Pittsburgh, which has won the last two championships. "It's been 20 long, dry years and we are back," Capitals public address announcer Wes Johnson said. "This is catharsis. Once we beat the Penguins, then you could see that the fan base was like, `Let's just play hockey.' As John Walton said, it's OK to believe. It's not just OK to believe. Just believe." Among markets with teams in the NFL, NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball, only the Twin Cities in Minnesota has a longer championship drought going than Washington. The Redskins won their third Super Bowl title in January 1992 and it's been mostly grim since then. None of the Redskins, Wizards, Nationals and Capitals even reached a league semifinal from 1998 until this spring. In that same time, Boston's teams have made 25 league semifinal appearances and won 10 titles. Maybe success is contagious. "Last year all of those (other Washington) teams made the playoffs and then it was like, hey we got to do the same too, and we dropped the ball," Redskins running back Chris Thompson said. "If you see your D.C. teams succeeding and the Capitals now (in) the finals and stuff like that, it's a little bit of motivation." The Capitals got over the hump in their 10th playoff appearance after early exits marred by sudden-death overtime winners, a hot goaltender named Jaroslav Halak, the New York Rangers and — of course — the Penguins. "It's just been one nightmare after another," said Anthony Beverina, who has had season tickets in section 417 since 1997-98. "And it makes you wonder if there's some inherit either cosmic conspiracy or a core character issue in the core guys." The nightmare has slowly felt like a dream on this playoff run, which was unexpected following an offseason of salary-cap casualties in the wake of another crushing second-round loss to Pittsburgh. Players rallied around lower preseason expectations, and even going into the playoffs Washington wasn't supposed to do this. "This team is so fun," said George Christo, a Boston transplant who has had season tickets since 1995-96. "This team is the most fun since that '98 team primarily because, both of those teams, who on earth expected either of these teams to be able to get this deep and to be that tough?" After so many early playoff exits, Capitals fans are reluctant to feel too good about things. Christo said even his children have almost gotten sick of going to games —until this year, which has challenged a lot of the old conventions about doomsday D.C. sports. "There are people sitting in season-ticket-holder seats because they're home mashing teeth and biting their fingernails," Patterson said. "A lot of fans around the country when their team is in the playoffs, they like to have get-togethers and parties, viewing parties for the away games and stuff like that. But if you've been through some of this stuff, after the second game of a playoff series, there won't be any of that because you can't have your friends over and watch a game and then have everybody in that awful mood when it's over and they're shaking hands and you're on the losing side." It was the opposite Wednesday night when almost 10,000 people wearing red watched on video screens above a basketball court as Capitals players and coaches were on the winning side of their handshake line with the Lightning. Cheers greeted Ovechkin touching the Prince of Wales Trophy and then the flash of the Stanley Cup Final schedule before the series against former general manager George McPhee's Vegas Golden Knights begins. "We're going to the Stanley Cup Final," Ovechkin said. "I think everybody is happy, but we still have unfinished, you know what I mean. I don't know, I'm emotional right now. I think we've been waiting for this moment for a long time." Game 3 on June 2 will be the first Cup Final game in the district since 1998, when the Capitals were swept by the Detroit Red Wings. One more win will make this the most successful season in franchise history, and though superstition and history keeps fans from thinking about the "what if" of four more, they're no longer afraid to enjoy the ride. "Now you're excited by the win, you're not just dreading how are they going to blow this game," Beverina said. "It's been nothing but fun this year." That fun extends to the Capitals' locker room, which looked to have much less talent on paper than in previous seasons. But players feel different about this year, too, and have embraced each other as much as their common goal. "I think our group here really understands what it means to be a team and how to win," veteran Nicklas Backstrom said. "Maybe in the past we've had more skill or been better on paper or whatever. But this team everyone knows their role and everyone wants to pitch in and everyone is comfortable with each other. I haven't been on a team like this where in any situation we're confident and confident in each other."
On third anniversary of downed MH17 jet, relatives unveil 'living memorial' for the victims  [SEP]  Vijfhuizen (Netherlands) (AFP) - Three years after Flight MH17 was shot down by a missile over war-torn Ukraine, more than 2,000 relatives gather Monday to unveil a "living memorial" to their loved ones. A total of 298 trees have been planted in the shape of a green ribbon, one for each of the victims who died on board the Malaysia Airlines flight en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. Dutch King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima will join government and international officials at a solemn ceremony to dedicate the memorial in the park of Vijfhuizen, close to Amsterdam's Schiphol airport where the flight took off from on July 17, 2014. The names of all the 298 passengers and crew killed in the disaster will be read out by their families, and 17 local children will lay flowers. While most of the victims were Dutch, there were 17 nationalities on board including Australians, Britons, Malaysians and Indonesians. "A tree symbolises 'hope' and 'future' in many cultures," the victims' families association said in a statement. "We not only want to honour the MH17 victims, but also want to create a place where everyone can keep their memories of the 298 passengers alive." Funded by donations, the project was designed by artist Ronald A. Westerhuis and landscape architect Robbert de Koning after it was chosen out of three proposals by relatives in late 2015. As the third anniversary of the tragedy dawns, no suspects have been arrested although it was announced this month that any trials will be held in The Netherlands. About 100 people are wanted in connection with the disaster, after Dutch-led investigators concluded the plane was shot down by a Russian-made BUK missile transported from Russia into areas held by pro-Russian rebels. in Kiev, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on Monday insisted Moscow must be held to account over the tragedy. "It was a barefaced crime that could have been avoided if not for the Russian aggression, Russian system and Russian missile that came from Russian territory," Poroshenko wrote on Facebook. Russia and the separatist authorities it supports, however, continue to deny any involvement and have sought repeatedly to deflect the blame onto Ukraine. The trees in the memorial will be surrounded by sunflowers, which bloom in July, and will "radiate a golden glow" over the trees, the foundation said. The flowers also represent "the sunflower fields in eastern Ukraine where some parts of the plane wreckage were found." Each of the trees bears the name of one of the victims. And at the heart of the forest of 11 different tree varieties is a steel memorial shaped like an eye, turned upwards looking at the skies. One apple tree has been dedicated to 16-year-old Gary, from Rotterdam, whose body has still not yet been identified. "It's nice to think that he has a tree, since we have not received his body. We don't want Gary to be forgotten. We don't want any of the 298 victims to be forgotten," his father Jan Slok, told the daily AD newspaper. The 16-metre-long steel eyebrow above the eye represents "the burden of the loss," the Trouw daily said, adding with time it will rust, a symbol of the slow passage of pain. The victims' names are also engraved in the pupil of the eye. "If you look inside, you can see both yourself and the name of your loved one," Westerhuis told Trouw.
The latest: Crude pipe bombs sent to Obama, Clintons, CNN; no injuries  [SEP]  The U.S. Secret Service says agents have intercepted packages containing “possible explosive devices” addressed to former President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. An NYPD bomb squad vehicle departs an area outside Time Warner Center on Wednesday, Oct. 24, 2018, in New York. (AP Photo/Kevin Hagen) Crude pipe bombs targeting Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama, CNN and others were intercepted Tuesday night and Wednesday in a rash of attacks two weeks before nationwide elections that could reshape Congress and serve as a referendum on the first two years of President Donald Trump’s presidency. The devices, which officials said shared a similar design, were aimed at prominent Democrats and a cable news network often criticized by political conservatives. A similar device was found Monday at the New York compound of liberal billionaire George Soros, a major contributor to Democratic causes. The bombs overtook other campaign news in an already-tense political season, which has included pitched fights over immigration, the Supreme Court and sexual violence against women. The White House quickly condemned the attacks aimed at Democrats and perceived foes of the administration. “Acts or threats of political violence have no place in the United States,” Trump said. “This egregious conduct is abhorrent.” “That’s a very bipartisan statement,” he said. All the confirmed bombs appeared to come from the same person or persons, said John Miller, the New York Police Department’s head of intelligence and counterterrorism, who briefed reporters in New York. The U.S. Secret Service intercepted a bomb that was addressed to Hillary Clinton at the Chappaqua, New York, home she shares with former President Bill Clinton, and another that was sent to former President Obama at his home with Michelle Obama in Washington. A police bomb squad removed still another from CNN’s New York headquarters, which was evacuated. Related: Obama to deliver Mandela address in likely rebuke to Trump Overhead TV shots showed a truck carrying that device, which law enforcement officials said was linked to the other explosives, being driven away. The package sent to CNN contained a live explosive and envelope with white powder, and officials said the substance was being tested to see if it was dangerous. “We will not rest until we stop these hazardous devices from being mailed and bring the individual or individuals to justice,” said Bryan Paarmann, the FBI’s top counterterrorism official in New York. The FBI also said it was responding to a report of a suspicious package at a Florida office of Rep. Deborah Wasserman Schultz. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said his office received a similar package, but New York police officials said the office was cleared and no device was found. Cuomo said at a briefing that “we will not allow these terrorist thugs to change the way we live our lives.” A U.S. official told The Associated Press that investigators believe the explosive that was discovered near the Clintons’ home was linked to one found Monday at the Soros compound. The official noted that one of the packages had the return address of Florida Rep. Schultz, a reference to the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee who was accused by Clinton rivals of secretly helping the party’s eventual presidential nominee. Neither Clinton nor Obama received the packages, and neither was at risk of receiving them because of screening procedures, the Secret Service said. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement, “These terrorizing acts are despicable, and anyone responsible will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.” Two law enforcement officials, speaking to AP on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, said the pipe bomb at CNN was crude but operational and was addressed to former CIA Director John Brennan, who regularly appears as a television contributor and who has publicly clashed with Trump. They said it was similar to other explosives discovered in the past few days. The device was mailed in an envelope to CNN’s offices on Columbus Circle using six stamps. It was compact, perhaps about the length of a wooden spoon, and contained wires and a black pipe, officials said. Hillary Clinton was attending campaign events for Democrats in Florida on Tuesday and Wednesday and was not at the family’s New York residence at the time. Bill Clinton was at the family’s Chappaqua home at the time the package was intercepted Tuesday night at a Westchester County facility, said a person familiar with his schedule. The person said the device was screened at the facility — not in proximity to their residence — and never reached the Clintons’ home. A law enforcement official told the AP that the package discovered at Soros’ home appeared to be a pipe bomb and was in a package placed in a mailbox outside the gates of the compound. A Soros employee opened it just inside the gates, not near Soros’ quarters, the official said.

US sets medals record, Canada ties gold record  [SEP]  VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) - While the Vancouver Olympics aren't finished, the medal races are - and in spectacular fashion for North Americans. The United States is guaranteed 37 medals and Canada will finish with at least 13 gold medals. Both are the best of these games and part of the greatest hauls ever at a Winter Olympics. The Americans will leave with the most medals by any country at any Winter Games. They also will win the medal count for only the second time, the other being at Lake Placid in 1932. Steven Holcomb and the "Night Train" delivered the 36th medal, and ninth gold, for the United States by winning the four-man bobsled event Saturday. The 37th will come from the men's hockey team. Whether it is gold or silver will be determined Sunday. Canada invested $117 million and five years into an "Own the Podium" program that was supposed to win the medals race. At least it bought the top step. The Canadians have matched the record of 13 golds set by the Soviets in 1976 and Norway in 2002. It's also the most gold Canada has won at any Olympics, winter or summer, and its the most for any Winter Olympics host country; both those marks had been 10. And how's this for timing: Lucky No. 13 came in the nation's second-favorite sport, curling, with beloved skip Kevin Martin shoving aside the Norway guys wearing those tacky trousers. The record-setting 14th could come Sunday in the nation's far and away favorite sport, hockey, with Sidney Crosby and friends facing the Americans. Canadians also will finish third on the overall medals list. They've claimed 26, counting the one in hockey. Germany is second with 29. All told, it's a staggering list of achievements for the hosts and their nearest neighbor. Bottom line: The rest of the world is probably glad the next two Winter Games will be held in other continents. Among the other highlights Saturday: -The U.S men's team pursuit squad in speedskating took silver, finishing just behind - guess who? - Canada. -A few minutes later, Canada got another gold when Jasey-Jay Anderson won the men's parallel giant slalom. -Norway's Marit Bjoergen was a photo finish from getting her fourth gold medal of these games. She wound up settling for silver and becoming the first person in Vancouver with five medals; nobody else even has four. There are only two events on Sunday, the hockey game and a 50-kilometer men's cross-country race. The Americans hadn't won gold in four-man bobsledding since 1948. And they did it by knocking off a German crew led by Andre Lange, who had won all four Olympics races he's ever entered. His crew wound up with silver, one-hundredth of a second faster than the Canadians. "No more 62 years," Holcomb said. "We'll start the clock over. Now it's going to be four years." A slew of U.S. teammates rushed to Holcomb's sledto celebrate. Among the first to offer congratulations was Geoff Bodine, the 1986 Daytona 500 champion who was behind the group that paid for and built the team's sleds. Chad Hedrick and a pair of 19-year-old teammates couldn't keep up with the Canadians. Hedrick took silver in the final race of his career. He goes out with five medals in five events, joining Eric Heiden as the only American men to win that many at the oval. Germany repeated as the gold winners in women's team pursuit, edging Japan by two-hundredths of a second in the final after escaping the semifinals with Anni Friesinger-Postma's belly slide across the line to beat the Americans. Poland claimed the bronze, overcoming the United States when Catherine Raney-Norman couldn't keep up with teammates Jennifer Rodriguez and Jilleanne Rookard. They crossed ahead of the Poles, but the time only counts when all three skaters finish. Bode Miller wasn't able to add anything beyond the gold, silver and bronze he'd already won. He bailed out just a few gates into the slalom, a casualty of "grabby" snow that bedeviled a slew of skiers. Miller is one of only five men to get three Alpine medals at a games, a record performance for a U.S. skier. His five career Olympic medals are tied for second on the career list behind Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt, who has eight. "I really couldn't be much happier," Miller said. "I came out, I was ready, I was prepared - that's all the stuff you can do." Giuliano Razzoli won, giving Italy's first Alpine medal in the Winter Games in 16 years. Ivica Kostelic of Croatia picked up his second silver in Vancouver, while Austria's usually powerful men's team finished an Olympic shutout. Anderson, a seven-time World Cup champion, carved through the rain-sluiced, fogged-in course to take down Austria's Benjamin Karl, the top-ranked rider in the world. It was his first Olympic medal in four tries, adding it to his four world championship golds and a career that has done more than anyone's to spread the word of snowboarding across his wintry country. Bronze medalist Mathieu Bozzetto of France called the conditions "ugly," and American Tyler Jewell said if this had been a World Cup event, "they probably would have canceled it." American Chris Klug - who won bronze in 2002, 18 months after a lifesaving liver transplant - knocked off the top seed but later skidded out. He finished seventh, Jewell 13th. Eight years ago in Salt Lake City, Martin's final stone went inch too far and the Canadians lost the gold medal to the Norwegians. This time, with a sellout crowd singing the national anthem, Martin's final stone didn't even matter. Canada stormed through the tournament 11-0 to win gold for the second straight Olympics. (Martin, however, wasn't on the 2006 squad.) Switzerland swept past Sweden for the men's bronze medal, getting two points on its final rock. Finland became the first to win three medals since the NHL let its players compete at the 1998 Winter Games with a 5-3 win over Slovakia. Finland is the only team to be a repeat medalist, following up the silver it won four years ago. Goalie Miikka Kiprusoff was solid in the net with 19 saves, regaining his confidence just one day after he was pulled when the U.S. scored four goals on seven shots in just 10 minutes. "We believed that we could come back, and it was a huge comeback," Teemu Selanne said. "After 23 years playing for the national team, after five Olympics, this is a dream come true." Canada turned in its four cross-country skiers for the 50-kilometer mass start classic race on Sunday, and it doesn't include legally blind Brian McKeever, who was hoping to become the first competitor in both the Winter Olympics and Paralympics. The 30-year-old McKeever - who started going blind in college because of a degenerative disease, but still has peripheral vision - said he understands the decision. "Olympic dream over," he wrote on his Twitter account. "I don't think I've ever been so sad." In the women's 30k classical race, Poland's Justyna Kowalczyk beat Bjoergen in a photo finish. Kowalczyk, the World Cup leader, now has a medal of each color. Alpine skier Noelle Barahona of Chile is sticking around for the closing ceremony after learning her family was safe following the devastating earthquake in her country. Barahone actually was planning on going home Saturday, but couldn't get a flight. The rest of the delegation still in Vancouver includes a team spokesman and a physical therapist; they both also heard that family and friends are OK. Chile's two other Olympians already had left Vancouver, one to France and the other to Seattle. The head of the next Olympics - the 2012 Summer Games in London - hopes to match the full venues and lively crowds he's seen in Vancouver. "Not since Sydney (in 2000) have I seen a city embrace the games the way they've been embraced here," Sebastian Coe said. "My gut instinct is that is what these games will be remembered for." Coe and about 50 staffers have been in Vancouver to see how things are being done. Copyright 2010 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Operation Olive Branch launched in Syria's Afrin to clear PKK, Daesh, Turkish military says  [SEP]  The Operation Olive Branch has been launched in Syria's northwestern Afrin region to clear terrorist groups such as the PKK and its affiliates KCK, PYD, YPG; and Daesh, the Turkish Armed Forces said Saturday in a statement. The operation has been launched as of Jan. 20, 5:00 p.m. to neutralize terrorist groups and liberate friendly and brotherly people of the region from oppression and tyranny, it added, noting that the operation aims to provide security and stability along Turkey's borders and in the region. The operation complies with international law, U.N. Security Council resolutions, especially No. 1624 (2005), 2170 (2014) and 2178 (2014); and Article 51 of the U.N. Charter on Right of Self Defense, the statement said. It underlined that during the operation's planning and conduct, only terrorists and their shelters, weapons, vehicles and tools are being targeted and utmost care is being shown for civilians not to be harmed. While ground troops located in Kilis province near the Syrian border aim at PKK/PYD targets with howitzers, tank units, multiple rocket launchers, Turkish warplanes target previously identified terrorists in an air operation, media sources reported. Rising smoke were observed from places near the Turkish-Syrian border, reports said. Meanwhile, the Interfax news agency cited the Russian Defense Ministry, saying that Russian military operational groups and military police were relocated from Afrin.
Cable car to famed Rio peak suspended after nearby shootout  [SEP]  Rio de Janeiro: A cable car service which runs to Rio de Janeiro´s Sugarloaf Mountain, one of Brazil´s most famous tourist attractions, was suspended Friday after a nearby shootout that wounded a policeman. "The Sugarloaf cable car service is temporarily suspended due to a police operation," the firm that runs the service told AFP. Military police in Rio confirmed in a statement that an operation began Friday morning in favelas in the hilly areas of Leme district, a popular tourist area in the city´s south, where a number of shootings have occurred in recent days near the famed Copacabana beach. The police operations, which are becoming increasingly frequent in Rio, are aimed at destroying the grip of drug gangs. The other side of the hills looks out on the Urca district, where the Sugarloaf cable car begins its 396 meter (yard) climb to the top, offering a stunning panoramic of the "Marvelous City." "At around 1:00pm (1600 GMT), police came across a group of armed men and a shootout ensued in the forest. A policeman was lightly wounded by grenade shrapnel," police said, adding that an operation was ongoing. By late afternoon, a helicopter was flying over the area and the police were searching on jet skis for the suspects at sea, an AFP photographer said. Nearly two years after hosting the Olympics, Rio de Janeiro is experiencing a surge in violence. At the end of February, President Michel Temer entrusted the army with the city´s security, though the policy has not resulted in any real reduction in insecurity.
Dumbarton minister caught up in Gambia state of emergency  [SEP]  A Dumbarton minister has been caught up in chaos in the Gambia amid fears of civil unrest in the country. Rev Kenny Macaulay of St Augustine’s Church on High Street is in the west African country visiting Dumbarton London Corner Nursery School which is sponsored locally. He flew out last Wednesday with wife Linda, colleague Liz O’Ryan and Caroline Marsland who is involved in the church’s Food For Thought project. The minister, who along with Rev O’Ryan, is also responsible for St Mungo’s in Alexandria, posted on Facebook on Monday night from the Gambian capital Banjul just before a 90-day state of emergency was declared by president Yahya Jammeh who is unwilling to step down from office after being beaten at the polls by Adama Barrow. He said: “Really sorry to those trying to contact us through Messenger. We are not getting or being allowed to send messages. Text us if need be! Third World problems. Prayers for The Gambia please. Things are very tense at the moment.” Friends and family have since been trying to reach the group including Rev Tina Kemp, ministry assistant at Helensburgh Parish Church which is linked with Rhu and Shandon. She spoke to the Lennox Herald this morning. The Dumbarton woman said: “He had messaged a couple of days ago to say don’t message us as we are not able to receive or send. “Despite that, he seemed to be able to post on Facebook but there’s been nothing since. He had advised people to contact him by text, “I texted him yesterday but I’ve no heard anything back. As far as I am aware, they are in a tourist area.” The group were expected to return to Dumbarton later this week in any case but friends and family are on stand-by to find out if they will be sent home earlier as tour operators are flying home Britons from the Gambia as a result of the state of emergency which has been declared. The west African nation has become a political battleground following presidential elections last month. Jammeh declared a 90-day state of emergency on Tuesday, two days before he is due to leave office. As a result the UK Foreign Office (FCO) has advised against all but essential travel due to “deteriorating political situation and potential military intervention following the presidential elections”. Thomas Cook has cancelled all flights to the Gambia until Friday and are running four extra flights today to bring tourists home. In a statement, the firm said: “We are dispatching a special assistance team with our first flight from the UK to provide additional support at Banjul airport for our customers. Our colleagues on the ground in the Gambia will proactively contact all customers on holiday with us as soon as possible to prepare for return to the UK.” The FCO advised: “The potential for military intervention and civil disturbance is high and could result in Banjul International Airport being closed at short notice. “You should follow events closely, take extra care, keep in regular contact with your tour operator and airline and continue to monitor travel advice and social media updates in case tensions rise as the current political deadlock continues.” Dumbarton minister Rev Macaulay set up the 90-pupil school around 12 years ago following a visit to Serrekunda – one of the poorest areas of the Gambia. He remains chair of the Dumbarton-based Gambia Education Association, with Rev Kemp vice-chair. A coffee morning was held at Helensburgh Parish Church in aid of Dumbarton London Corner Nursery School at the weekend with £760 raised for the cause. For more local news click here .
Police: Multiple people shot in Kentucky grocery store  [SEP]  JEFFERSONTOWN, Ky. (AP) — A male suspect fatally shot a man and a woman at a Kroger grocery store on the outskirts of Louisville, Kentucky, on Wednesday, and then exchanged fire with an armed bystander… JEFFERSONTOWN, Ky. (AP) — A male suspect fatally shot a man and a woman at a Kroger grocery store on the outskirts of Louisville, Kentucky, on Wednesday, and then exchanged fire with an armed bystander before fleeing the scene, police said. He was captured shortly afterward. Both victims died at the store, said Jeffersontown Police Chief Sam Rogers. He did not say whether police had determined a motive. He also did not identify the suspect. Police received a call about 3 p.m. reporting the shooting, Rogers said. He said the suspect fired multiple rounds at the man inside the store, and shot the female victim multiple times out in the parking lot. A citizen armed with a gun engaged the shooter in the parking lot, but the suspect was able to flee before he was captured on a nearby road, Rogers said. Eric Deacon, who identified himself as an EMT, told The Associated Press that he was in the self-checkout lane of the store when he heard the first shot, in the pharmacy. He said a man came around the corner and “the look on his face, he looked like he just didn’t care.” Deacon said he saw another man in the store with a gun who appeared to be shooting at the suspect, trying to get him out of the store. Deacon went outside and saw a woman in her mid-50s or early 60s who had been hit, and tried to resuscitate her. “She was gone, there’s nothing I could do,” Deacon said. “I think she just got caught in the crossfire.” As police officers swarmed the scene and blocked off the area with yellow crime tape, a man identified by the Louisville Courier Journal as Tim King stood in the parking lot waiting for his wife to come out. He said he drove to the store after she called him sobbing to tell him what had happened. “I said, ‘What’s wrong?'” King said in a video posted on the newspaper’s website. “And she said, ‘There’s someone shooting up here.'” King said his wife said she heard popping noises, then someone ran around a corner and said, “Oh my God, he’s killed her.” Customers were moved to the back of the store, she said. “It’s just a very, very scary situation,” King said. The Kroger Co. issued a statement saying that company officials were “shocked and saddened by the shooting.” “Thanks to the quick response of the local police department, the suspect was apprehended and our store is secure.” The store was closed and will not reopen until the investigation is complete, the release said.

At State Department, 'Dissent Channel' In High Gear With Refugee Ban Protests  [SEP]  At the State Department, there is an easy — and usually private — way for employees to register their concerns about U.S. policy. It's called the "Dissent Channel." And today, an unusually large number of foreign service officers are using it. A dissent cable says Donald Trump's temporary visa and refugee ban "runs counter to American values" and could be "counterproductive." The White House claims it consulted for "many weeks" with the State Department before issuing its executive order on Friday, temporarily banning visas for citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries and suspending the U.S. refugee resettlement program. State Department officials who were involved in the refugee program deny this. One retired ambassador, Laura Kennedy, says the executive order did not read as if it had been reviewed by State Department lawyers or by consular or refugee officials. "It is just, as the dissent message makes clear, inconsistent with values, with security aims of the administration, with process, with any number of things," Kennedy says. The Dissent Channel was set up in the Vietnam War era as a way for foreign service officers and civil servants to raise concerns with upper management about the direction of U.S. foreign policy, without the fear of retribution. The cables are sent to the State Department's policy planning director, who distributes them to the secretary of state and other top officials, who must respond within 30 to 60 days. There are typically about four or five each year. "Freedom from reprisal for Dissent Channel users is strictly enforced," according to the State Department. During her 40-year State Department career, Kennedy never signed a dissent cable herself. She remembers one time in the 1990s when more than a dozen diplomats raised concerns about U.S. policy in the Balkans. Last year, about 50 foreign service officers criticized the Obama administration for failing to do enough to protect civilians in Syria. But this executive order, titled "Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States," is generating much more attention. "I know that many serving officers were horrified by this message," Kennedy says, referring to the order. The draft dissent cable – which has been published by the Lawfare blog — points out that the overwhelming majority of attacks on U.S. soil are committed by native-born or naturalized U.S. citizens, individuals who have been living in the U.S for decades or since birth. And it points out that terrorist attacks carried out by foreign nationals entering the U.S. on visas have come from countries that are not included in the ban, such as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. On Monday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer was dismissive of the dissent cable. "I think they should get with the program or they can go," he said. All this comes at a time when the Trump administration has cleared out top management positions at the State Department without naming anyone new to replace them. Rex Tillerson, Trump's nominee for secretary of state, is still awaiting confirmation.
Far-away asteroid named after Freddie Mercury on birthday  [SEP]  LONDON (AP) — Queen guitarist Brian May says an asteroid in Jupiter's orbit has been named after the band's late frontman Freddie Mercury on what would have been his 70th birthday. May says the International Astronomical Union's Minor Planet Centre has designated an asteroid discovered in 1991, the year of Mercury's death, as "Asteroid 17473 Freddiemercury." May, who has a doctorate in astrophysics from Imperial College, London, says the newly named asteroid is "just a dot of light, but it's a very special dot of light" and recognizes Mercury's musical and performing talents. Mercury, born Sept. 5, 1946, wrote and performed hits including "Bohemian Rhapsody" and "We Are The Champions" with Queen, releasing over a dozen studio albums between 1973 and 1991.
Dozens of tourists missing in boat capsize off Thailand’s Phuket  [SEP]  Dozens of tourists missing in boat capsize off Thailand’s Phuket PHUKET: Dozens of mainly Chinese passengers are missing after a boat capsized as high winds whipped up rough seas off the Thai tourist island of Phuket, officials said late Thursday. The boat was carrying around 90 passengers when it keeled over after it was hit by massive waves, prompting a rescue operation that stretched into the night and left authorities scrambling to react. The governor of southern Phuket, Noraphat Plodthong, said 49 people — over half of the passengers — were still “being helped” as rescue boats rushed to the scene. A second provincial official, requesting anonymity, told AFP rescuers “are working to find” the 49 missing. Television footage taken at a pier in Phuket showed stunned tourists huddling in blankets, while several women cried as medics tended to the injured. The boat was returning to Phuket from Koh Racha at around 4:00 pm (0900 GMT) when a storm hit, according to the captain, who identified himself as Somjing Boontham in a televised interview. He said the boat was hit by five metre-high waves, which flooded the boat and started to slowly keel over, prompting him to warn passengers to put on life jackets and trigger inflatable life rafts. “So I sent someone to them to wear life jackets... They were all Chinese visitors — apart from two farang,” he said using Thai vernacular for westerners, adding around half the passengers were unaccounted for. Phuket is a magnet for overseas visitors including Western sun-seekers and Chinese tourists who will make up the bulk of the 35 million people expected to visit the kingdom this year.
New Railway to Connect Tel Aviv With Yerushalayim  [SEP]  YERUSHALAYIM (Reuters) - Tel Aviv and Yerushalayim may only be 40 miles apart but they often feel like different planets, because the commute from the Mediterranean to the hills can sometimes take two hours. That is set to change in the next 18 months with the completion of a $2 billion, high-speed rail line that will slash the time between the two cities to just 30 minutes. After more than a decade in the planning, the project, which has involved boring tunnels through mountains and spanning bridges over deep valleys, promises to bring Israel’s two largest cities a little closer. “We are doing in Israel what was done 200 years ago in the United States, after World War II in Europe and in recent decades in Asia,” Transport Minister Yisrael Katz said on Tuesday, touting several new rail lines in the works. “The main aim is to connect Yerushalayim to the rest of the country.” There is already a train between Yerushalayim and the coast – built during the Ottoman empire and added to by the French and the British – but it’s a slow, scenic route that takes an hour and 40 minutes, not ideal for commuting. That said, around 7,500 people still ride it most days. Working with 10 foreign companies, the line runs over 10 bridges and through five tunnels. Construction began in 2010 and is scheduled to end in March 2018. Double-decker trains holding around 1,700 passengers will travel at 100 mph. The plan is for four departures an hour, serving 50,000 commuters a day, or 10 million a year, said Boaz Zafrir, the chief executive of Israel Railways. The new line also promises to be a boon for foreign diplomats, Israeli government employees and parliament members, many of whom live on the coast but commute to Yerushalayim almost daily and often lament the traffic jams.
Feds Arrest NSA Contractor in Leak of Secret Russia Document  [SEP]  A woman was arrested for leaking a top-secret National Security Agency document that reveals details about Russian hacking's influence on the U.S. presidential election, a senior federal official told NBC News. Reality Leigh Winner, 25, was charged with "gathering, transmitting, or losing defense information" to The Intercept. The story published Monday features a secret NSA document that notes efforts by the Russian government to hack into a voting software company approximately a week before the election. While the document doesn't say the hacking changed any votes, it "raises the possibility that Russian hacking may have breached at least some elements of the voting system, with disconcertingly uncertain results." The document was classified at some of the highest levels. Winner is a contractor with Pluribus International Corporation since mid-February, with a Top Secret clearance, authorities said. The NSA has a facility in Georgia. The FBI said when they approached Winner she admitted to printing out the document, removing it from her place of work and mailing it to The Intercept. The report is published just a days after NBC's Megyn Kelly sat down with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the hacking accusations, which Putin vehemently denies. Putin said that "it wouldn't make sense" for Russia to interfere with the election.
Mumbai: Five killed as 12-seater plane crashes in Ghatkopar  [SEP]  A 12-seater aircraft crashed at a construction site in suburban Mumbai on Thursday afternoon, killing all four on board, including the pilot, co-pilot and two aircraft maintenance personnel. A fifth person, a pedestrian, also died when the Beechcraft King C90, owned by Mumbai-based UY Aviation Pvt Ltd, crashed into the pillars and tin sheet-fence of an under-construction building in Ghatkopar area. The aircraft was on its first test flight after three years in maintenance. By Thursday evening, the deceased were identified as Captain P S Rajput (49), co-pilot Marya Zuberi (47) and aircraft maintenance engineer Surabhi and technician Manish Pandey. Surabhi and Manish had been employed by a company handling repairs to the aircraft. The charred bodies had to be identified by jewellery or other items on them. The passerby, whose body was found a few feet away from the burning debris, could not be identified formally. Local residents said he might be Govind Dubey (32), who has been missing since the crash. Related | Mumbai plane crash: Weather was bad, pilot didn’t want to fly, says co-pilot’s husband Sources said the aircraft suffered a minor accident in 2009-2010 in Uttar Pradesh after which it was grounded for five years. It was purchased in 2015. On Thursday, the aircraft flew for the first time in almost eight years. A two-member team of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, expected to arrive on Friday, will investigate the crash. According to senior DGCA officials, low visibility, due to heavy rains or an engine failure could have caused the crash. “It is too early to ascertain the reason for the crash. It will be investigated. As more than 60 per cent of the aircraft has been wrecked, the shudder was quite huge. The AAIB team will collect the evidence on Friday,” a DGCA official said. The black box and the flight data recorder have been kept at the DGCA office in Mumbai. “We have sealed the flying and maintenance records of the aircraft company. The call records with the ATC have also been seized. The AAIB team, which comes on Friday, will take back the black box to Delhi for further investigation,” a senior DGCA official said. Around 1.10 pm, the aircraft was seen nosediving into the steel reinforcements of an under-construction pillar at the Lifescapes Prithvii building in Jagruti Nagar, Ghatkopar (West). “It cut through a tree and crashed with force. The body of the aircraft landed on a pillar of the under-construction building, breaking the pillar. The fan blade of the crashing plane also broke the boundary barricades of the construction site. It landed with such force that one part flew into a building located behind the crash site,” an official from the aircraft fire rescue team said. The fuel tank burst leading to a blaze. Somnath Shah, a resident of a nearby building, said as the plane crashed, it left a trail of fuel on the street, which also caught fire. Labourers at the construction site, who were having lunch in the basement of another wing of the under-construction building, were among the first to witness the crash. Prakash Shigari, who had driven his autorickshaw into an adjoining lane, said: “We rushed to help the person whose body could be seen. But due to thick smoke, we could not do much immediately.” Police and fire brigade personnel made it to the crash site within 10 minutes. “Those on board were strapped to their seats and were under the debris. While we could find two bodies immediately, we had to dig up the debris to find the others. The rains made the rescue difficult,” a rescue official said. Those who saw the plane burst into flames said they did not hear it coming until it crashed through the trees. “We rushed to help. One burning body was near the debris,” said Bhausaheb Kadam, a who owns a paan shop nearby. The 22-year-old aircraft was purchased by UY Aviation from the state government of Uttar Pradesh in 2015. According to sources at the Juhu airport, the plane took off at 12.30 pm and was conducting its first test sortie after three years in maintenance. “It had completed close to 40 minutes in air, and had flown over Surat. It was almost about to land at Juhu airport when it crashed.” a senior airport official said. The pilots were in touch with the ATC at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai throughout the flight, as per protocol. “Hardly 200 nautical miles away from the airport, the pilots lost touch with the ATC. In their last communication, the pilots informed the Juhu ATC and Mumbai ATC that they are close to landing at the Juhu airport Runway 26. They were close to the Mumbai airport main runway,” a source at the Juhu airport said. Local policemen said more casualties were averted, as labourers at the construction site were on a lunch break in the basement of the building. Police officers said the DGCA has asked the crash site to be sealed for 24 hours so that they can scan the area for more evidence. The officials would also check CCTV footage from the constructed wing of the site that captured the crash. According to officials from UY Aviation, the co-pilot had clocked 900 hours of flying. “The pilot has flown over 5,000 hours. The co-pilot is known to have flown jet aircraft,” said Anil Chauhan, the head of operations at UY Aviation. The two engineers on board were from Indamer Aviation Limited, which had just completed maintenance of the aircraft. “We took it on a test flight as we were to start operations soon. The flight was in the air for an hour and just about to land at Juhu when the accident took place,” said Chauhan. The National Disaster Response Force personnel were also at the site soon after the crash. “After the bodies were removed, we conducted a search to retrieve the black box and other technical details from the aircraft. We have retrieved the black box and the Flight Data Recorder (FDR),” said Akhilesh Singh, Depty Commissioner of Police, Zone VIII. Chauhan said the UY Aviation would co-operate in the investigation. “It is too early to say who is responsible. We will help in the investigations,” he said. Till late on Thursday, the bodies of the deceased were neither officially identified nor handed over to families. While the family members of Zuberi and Rajput identified the bodies based on ornaments, there was no medical confirmation. According to police surgeon Dr SM Patil, the molar teeth, skin and blood samples of all the deceased have been preserved for DNA testing. “The bodies are completely burnt, and few suffered poly trauma and fractures. Identification is difficult,” Patil said. The Ghatkopar police registered an accidental death report in the case and said they have started recording statements of witnesses.

Indian court upholds death sentences in fatal gang rape on a New Delhi bus  [SEP]  NEW DELHI — India’s top court on Friday upheld the death sentences of four men who were convicted in the fatal gang-rape and torture of a 23-year-old medical student on a moving bus in the Indian capital nearly five years ago. The court held that the nature of the crime, which triggered massive protests across India, made it a fit case for the death penalty. It described the assault as “most brutal, barbaric and diabolical,” according to the Press Trust of India news agency. The victim’s father said he was happy with the court judgment and demanded that the convicts be hanged quickly. “The court heard our voice and gave justice,” Badri Singh said. Prosecutors said the four — Akshay Thakur, Vinay Sharma, Pawan Gupta and Mukesh — took their victim to the back of a private bus in New Delhi, raping her and then damaging her internal organs with an iron rod. She died two weeks later of injuries in a hospital in Singapore, where she was taken for treatment. The outrage over the New Delhi attack prompted quick action on legislation doubling prison terms for rapists to 20 years and criminalizing voyeurism, stalking and the trafficking of women. Indian lawmakers also voted to lower to 16 from 18 the age at which a person can be tried as an adult for heinous crimes. Defence attorney A. P. Singh, representing three of the men, said the court should have given a chance to reform and avoided the death penalty. He said he would seek a review of Friday’s judgment from Supreme Court judges. Ram Singh, the bus driver and the fifth suspect in the crime, was found hanging in his cell in Tihar prison in March 2013, months before the suspects were convicted. The sixth suspect was just months short of 18 years when the crime took place. He walked out of a correction home in December 2015 after spending three years — the maximum punishment for minors — sparking public outrage and an overhaul of the juvenile law. Indian courts are notorious for delays as more than 30 million cases are pending before them. In view of the massive protests across the country, the Indian government put the gang rape case on a fast-track trial. Swati Maliwal, chief of the New Delhi Commission for Women, said people in India were not scared of committing crimes because of long delays in bringing them to justice. “The fact is that the road to justice is very, very long in this country,” she said. “Even in this case, it has taken five years. But at least in five years, we are coming to a conclusion. There are women in the country who have been fighting court battles for 10 to 15 years.” At least six rapes were taking place in the Indian capital every day, she said. “Nothing much has changed because there is no fear among people that if they do something wrong, they will be punished,” she said.
Yemeni Forces Down Saudi F-15 Warplane over Saada  [SEP]  Alwaght- Yemeni air defense forces, backed by fighters from allied Popular Committees, have intercepted and shot down an F-15 fighter jet belonging to the Royal Saudi Air Force. Military sources confirmed to Yemeni news agency Saba, that the warplane was targeted with a surface-to-air missile while flying over the northwestern Yemeni province of Saada on Wednesday. The US-made modern warplane had taken part in bombardments against residential neighborhoods in the province, sources said. Earlier in the day, Saudi fighter jets targeted a vehicle as it was travelling along a road in the Nihm district of Yemen’s west-central province of Sana'a. Meanwhile, Yemeni forces shot down a Saudi-led spy drone in flight over Midi district Hajjah Governorate, Yemen a military official told Saba on Tuesday. The incident took place on Monday, the official said. Yemeni forces regularly target Saudi-led warplanes, spy drone flying over the country and also launch attacks inside the Saudi kingdom in retaliation for the Riyadh-led war on Yemen, which has claimed around 14,000 lives. The Saudi aggression was launched in March 2015 to reinstate a former Riyadh-friendly government and to eliminate the popular Ansarullah movement, that has been running state affairs in the absence of an effective administration. The offensive has, however, achieved neither of its goals despite the spending of billions of petrodollars and the enlisting of the cooperation of Saudi Arabia’s regional and Western allies.
Desperate Venezuelans defy Ecuador's passport rules and cross border  [SEP]  IPIALES, Colombia, Aug 19 (Reuters) - Dozens of furious Venezuelan migrants fleeing economic misery in Venezuela for a new life elsewhere on Sunday defied rules requiring they hold a valid passport to cross the border from Colombia into Ecuador, and authorities appeared to be allowing it. Hundreds of desperate people who traveled days from Venezuela, mostly by bus but some on foot, were prevented from passing the checkpoint near the southwestern town of Ipiales by a regulation set by Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno that kicked in on Saturday. But as tension mounted in the frigid Colombian mountain town, migrants decided to risk being detained and simply walked across the ungated and loosely guarded border, having spent days in freezing conditions at the Rumichaca crossing. "We have no money, we need to move on now and get our lives back," said Mayerly Isaguirre, out of breath from dragging her belongings up the steep hill at the Ecuadorian border. The primary school teacher, 37, was traveling with her boyfriend and had planned to cross legally with her Venezuelan national ID card en route to find work in Peru, where other family members successfully arrived weeks ago. But they were stopped by the new regulation. After more than 24 hours shivering from the cold at the border, she took the chance. "They haven't told us anything - we are just waiting around like idiots," she said, wheeling her fuchsia colored suitcase across the open check point as guards looked on. Peru's government announced immigration measures similar to Ecuador's on Friday, with passport requirements for Venezuelans beginning on Aug. 25. Ecuador on Sunday said children and adolescents traveling with their parents could cross without passports. "They're in limbo," said Gustavo Salvador, a Red Cross Ecuador worker. "Many people who are crossing illegally are going to be hit by fines at Peru's border, and these people don't have money." Ecuador's foreign and interior ministries declined to comment. A spokesman for Colombia's migration office could not immediately be reached for comment. On Sunday morning, arguments broke out between migrants - those rallying for people to move on into Ecuador in groups while others argued they should stay and do things "the right way." More than a million Venezuelan migrants have entered Colombia over the last 15 months, according to official estimates, but Ecuador, Peru and Brazil also have received many. Over the last two years, especially, many Venezuelans have struggled to obtain passports amid the OPEC nation's political and economic chaos. This year alone, 423,000 Venezuelans have entered Ecuador through the Rumichaca border. In Ipiales, Venezuelan migrants who said they had hitchhiked for days were huddled under blankets in tents. Exhausted and hungry, they scraped their last few pesos together to buy food. Many like Jorge Luis Torrealba, who traveled with 12 friends and family members, including two small children, were unable to find space in the tents and were sleeping on the freezing concrete pavement. "We are from the Caribbean, we can't handle this cold," he said, shivering despite wearing four t-shirts, two sweaters, two pairs of socks and two pairs of jeans. He said is considering trekking across the border to Peru but is afraid of what would happen to his children if he is detained. "We just want to move on." (Editing by Helen Murphy and Dan Grebler)
Twin blasts at mosque in Nigeria kill at least 24  [SEP]  The attack in Mubi town came a day after President Muhammadu Buhari met with US President Donald Trump at the White House and discussed the threat from the Nigeria-based Boko Haram extremist group At least 50 people were killed in a similar attack last year. File Pic A pair of explosions killed at least 24 worshippers at a mosque in northeastern Nigeria, with many of the victims caught in the second blast while trying to flee, police said yesterday. The attack in Mubi town came a day after President Muhammadu Buhari met with US President Donald Trump at the White House and discussed the threat from the Nigeria-based Boko Haram extremist group. Its fighters were quickly blamed for the blasts. This is the second time in six months that dozens have been killed in an attack on a Mubi mosque. In November, a teenage suicide bomber attacked worshippers as they gathered for morning prayers, killing at least 50 people in one of the region's deadliest assaults in years. "As I am talking to you now, 24 persons are confirmed dead and the scene is cordoned off by security personnel," said Adamawa state police spokesman Othman Abubakar.

Reports: Royal staff called for emergency meeting at Buckingham palace  [SEP]  LONDON -- The Queen of England reportedly called the entire staff for the royal household for a "highly unusual" emergency meeting late Wednesday night. UPDATE | Prince Philip to step down from official duties Several news outlets are speculating it could be concerning Queen Elizabeth or her husband, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh. According to the Daily Mail, staff from across the country have been summoned to the royal palace for the meeting. Senior royal officer Lord Chamberlain and private secretary Sir Christopher Geidt are expected to address staff, but the subject of that meeting is currently unknown. "Although meetings involving the entire royal household are occasionally called, the way this has been done at the eleventh hour is highly unusual and suggests that there is something major to be disseminated," a source told the Daily Mail. "But at the moment, only those closest to her genuinely know what on earth this is all about." The Queen, who turned 91 last month, was recently in the public eye when she met with British prime minister Theresa May to mark the dissolution of Parliament due to the general election. She and Prince Philip, who will turn 96 in June, just returned to the palace after celebrating a long Easter holiday. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the situation.
Theresa May flounders as Jeremy Corbyn turns up the heat on Brexit  [SEP]  Much to everyone’s surprise Jeremy Corbyn decided to go on Brexit at PMQs. And he made a very good fist of it. Given Labour’s own difficulties on the issue as illustrated by last night’s rebellion in the Lords you could understand why Corbyn might have wished to avoid the subject. Clearly the Cabinet’s disarray was too tempting to ignore for the Labour leader. "Does the Prime Minister agree with the Foreign Secretary that her plans for a customs partnership were crazy?" was his opening gambit. Theresa May immediately relapsed into her dismal speak-your-weight machine mode. We are, she said, leaving the European Union and leaving the customs union. As with all her subsequent answers these words were delivered with a weight and importance that belied the triteness and inadequacy of their content. Perhaps she surmised that if she feigned the role of Prime Minister nobody would realise she was a malfunctioning hologram bereft of any answers. Corbyn briefly acknowledged her non response before moving on to the the wider Cabinet confusion. He noted the differing views between the Business Secretary and the Foreign Secretary on the proposed customs arrangements. He pointed out that neither of the Cabinet’s preferred options were workable. And he noted that after 23 months the Government had failed to come up with a solution. When, he asked, would the Government bring forward the trade bill and the customs bill? The Prime Minister did not such much duck the question as run to the other side of the country, hide under a blanket and put her fingers in her ears before muttering “can’t hear you, can’t hear you.” We are working for the best deal, was the best response she could muster. Which you suppose is reassuring when the alternative would be a government knowingly working for the worst deal. Mrs May ended with a feeble attack on Labour’s performance in the local elections. Six times she was asked a direct question by the Labour leader and six times she failed to give a straight answer. Who knew that Brexit could prove such fertile ground for a Labour leader generally regarded as ambivalent on the subject?
Matthew still brings the pain to North Carolina  [SEP]  FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. — The flooding disaster is forecast to slowly unfold over the next several days as all that rain — more than a foot in places — flows into rivers and downstream, likely causing more inundation in many of the same places devastated by a similar deluge from Hurricane Floyd in 1999. Thousands of people found themselves suddenly trapped in homes and cars during the torrential rains. Rescuers in Coast Guard helicopters plucked some of them from rooftops and used military vehicles to reach others, including a woman who held on to a tree for three hours after her car was overrun by flood waters. The storm killed more than 500 people in Haiti and at least 20 in the U.S. — half of them in North Carolina. Most were swept away by flood waters. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said Sunday that authorities were searching for five people and feared they may find more victims. “Hurricane Matthew is off the map. But it is still with us. And it is still deadly,” McCrory said. Princeville, a town of 2,000 that disappeared in the waters of the Tar River during Floyd, was evacuated Sunday as the river was expected to rise to 17 feet above flood stage by late Monday — a level not seen since Floyd. McCrory expected more evacuations as some rivers were predicted to crest next Friday. David Bullock’s sister called him as he bought lottery tickets to tell him police were knocking on doors saying they had to go. He rebuilt his home after the 1999 flood. “If I get flooded again, I can’t take it. I can’t go back and take the expense. If I get flooded again I’m going to say, ’it’s yours, I’m gone,”’ Bullock said. More than a million people in South Carolina and North Carolina were without power, and at least four separate sections of Interstate 95 — the main artery linking the East Coast from Florida to Maine — were closed in North Carolina. The ferocity of the rain caught people by surprise. Ezekiel Crowe, 10, escaped the floods in Fayetteville on Saturday with his parents and seven brothers and sisters when a police boat plucked them from an apartment as the waters rose. “I was scared. I was scared. And I thought, I thought the world was going to end. But it didn’t,” he said. In Wilson County, rescuers were called when a 63-year-old woman didn’t make it home from work. They heard her cries for help while riding on top of a Humvee, and when they couldn’t get her with a rope, a National Guard soldier swam to her, staying until a rescue boat arrived, Emergency Management Director Gordon Deno, said. Even animals had to be saved. WRAL-TV showed a dog swimming around floodwaters Saturday. McCrory said he and his wife were riveted by the coverage and relieved to find out from the Coast Guard that the dog managed to get into a tree and they rescued it. The rainfall totals were staggering: Nearly 15 inches in Fayetteville and 8 inches in Raleigh. McCrory warned that cities along rivers in eastern North Carolina needed to be prepared for days of flooding. The Lumber River in Lumberton was 4 feet above its record level Sunday afternoon and was forecast to remain there for at least five days. Shortly before daybreak Sunday, the hurricane was downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone. As of 2 p.m. EDT, the storm was centred about 150 miles east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, moving out to sea. It still had hurricane-force winds of 75 mph. Elsewhere along the Atlantic coast, things were slowly returning to normal. Much of Savannah, Georgia, which had 17 inches of rain, was still without electricity. About 150 people stood in line for a grocery store to open like it was a Black Friday sale. Debbie Berta said she waited more than an hour to get propane gas for her grill. She also wanted “bread, potatoes, eggs — and a piece of sanity.” Matthew killed more than 500 people in Haiti last week, plowing into the desperately poor country at 145 mph. The fearsome storm then sideswiped hundreds of miles of the U.S. coastline from Florida through Georgia and the Carolinas, its eye staying far enough offshore that the damage in many places along the coast was relatively modest, consisting mostly of flooded streets, flattened trees and blown-down signs and awnings. A shift of just 20 or 30 miles could have meant widespread devastation nearer the ocean. An estimated 2 million people in the Southeast were ordered to evacuate their homes as Matthew closed in. In addition to the 10 deaths in North Carolina, there were four in Florida and three each in Georgia and South Carolina. Some were killed by falling trees, others by carbon monoxide fumes from a generator. One 66-year-old man near Columbia, South Carolina, died at a nursing facility when he got pinned under his electric wheelchair in water after the heavy rains. “People were hit. They weren’t hit as directly as we had feared, but it has left a lot of devastation in in its wake. Lives have been lost, property has been severely damaged and there’s still continuing risk of flooding going on,” President Barack Obama said at a fundraiser in Chicago. Property data firm CoreLogic projected that insured losses on home and commercial properties would amount to $4 billion to $6 billion, well below Hurricane Katrina’s $40 billion and Superstorm Sandy’s $20 billion. Waggoner reported from Raleigh, North Carolina.

Passenger Plane Crashes After Leaving Havana With 113 On Board  [SEP]  (HAVANA) — A Boeing 737 operated by state airline Cubana crashed on takeoff from Jose Marti International Airport in Havana on Friday with 104 passengers and nine crew aboard, coming to rest in a farm field where firefighters sprayed the charred fuselage with hoses. There was no immediate word on casualties. Officials said the plane was headed to the eastern city of Holguin when it crashed between the airport in southern Havana and the nearby town of Santiago de las Vegas. The plane lay in a field of yuca-root plants and appeared heavily damaged and burnt. Firefighters were trying to extinguish its smoldering remains. Government officials including President Miguel Diaz-Canel rushed to the site, along with a large number of emergency medical workers and ambulances. Residents of the rural area said they had seen some survivors being taken away in ambulances. A military officer who declined to provide his name to reporters said that there appeared to have been only three survivors in critical condition, but other officials declined to confirm that figure. The plane was rented by Cubana, which has taken many of its aging planes out of service in recent months due to mechanical problems. Cuba’s First Vice-President, Salvador Valdes Mesa, met Thursday with Cubana officials to discuss improvements in its heavily criticized service.

FBI investigating explosion at Minnesota mosque  [SEP]  By Karin Brulliard and Amy B Wang, (c) 2017, The Washington Post An explosion shook a Minneapolis-area mosque during morning prayers Saturday, and an FBI official said it was caused by an “improvised explosive device.” No one was injured in the blast at Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in Bloomington, Minn., which took place as a small number of worshipers gathered shortly after 5 a.m. Mohamed Omar, the center’s executive director, said in an interview that he was inside the mosque preparing for morning prayers when he felt a “huge explosion” that quickly caused smoke and flames. Omar said another person present later told him he had heard the sound of a window breaking and then a pickup truck fleeing outside. “The sprinkler system went off and immediately water came down,” Omar said. “We didn’t know what was happening but it was scary.” Jaylani Hussein, the executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said 15 to 20 worshipers are typically present for morning prayers. The explosion took place inside the imam’s office, which was next to a prayer area in the mosque, Hussein said. Another “overflow” prayer area behind the imam’s office was also empty, he added. “If it was Ramadan or one of the busier times, all of the space would be used,” Hussein said in an interview. Rick Potts, the FBI’s special agent in charge of the investigation, told reporters Saturday afternoon that the blast was caused by an “improvised explosive device” but offered no further details about its composition or possible suspects. Neither the FBI nor the Bloomington Police Department, which initially responded to the explosion, speculated on a motive for the incident. “At this point, our focus is to determine who and why,” Potts said at a news conference. “Is it a hate crime? Is it an act of terror?. . .Again, that’s what the investigation is going to determine.” The attack was quickly condemned by religious leaders and politicians. Hussein said a “standing opposition group” has regularly protested against the mosque – and sometimes its mere existence – since it opened in 2011. “Hate is not okay,” Asad Zaman, executive director of the Muslim American Society of Minnesota, told reporters, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. “We need an America where people are safe with their neighbors.” If the attack was motivated by anti-Muslim bias, it would represent “another in a long list of hate incidents targeting Islamic institutions nationwide in recent months,” CAIR-MN civil rights director Amir Malik said. CAIR said in a report last month that anti-Muslim hate crimes in the United States nearly doubled in the first half of this year over the same period in 2016. At least 35 anti-mosque acts – including vandalism and arson – were reported during the first three months of this year, the organization has said. Last week, vandals spray-painted swastikas and hateful graffiti at the Al Magfirah cemetery in Castle Rock Township, just outside the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, the Associated Press reported. Other messages at the Muslim cemetery read “666” and “leave you R Dead,” according to photos published by the KSTP News. Since the morning attack at the mosque, the area has been shut down as an active crime scene, but it has also attracted well-wishers, from neighbors to other members of the faith community. “The churches around and synagogues . . . almost all of them came down and showed their support,” Omar said. “We are strong and we don’t want to lose hope because of things that happen.” CAIR’s Minnesota chapter and the Muslim American Society each offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction of a perpetrator in the Dar Al-Farooq attack. The society urged “the community to be calm and remain safe.” Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., said on Twitter that he was “horrified” by the incident. Ilham Omar, a Somali American state representative who is Muslim, called on Minnesotans to “stand together in opposition to hate.” “This building is more than a religious symbol,” she said in a statement. “It’s a place where Minnesotans are gathering to create community, to talk to their neighbors, to learn about our world and each other, and to help care for children.”
Wildfire moves closer to Glacier National Park’s scenic road  [SEP]  A wildfire in Montana's Glacier National Park is forcing more evacuations and has burned within a half-mile of the scenic Going-to-the-Sun Road. Protecting the highway through the park is officials' priority, with firefighters installing hoses and sprinklers to prevent it from spreading there, The Missoulian newspaper reported Sunday. If that happens, destabilization could lead rock and trees to fall for years, operations chief Rocky Gilbert said. Part of the 50-mile, two-lane road is closed. The road spans the width of the park and crosses the Continental Divide, according to the Visit Montana website. Officials evacuated the Fish Creek Campground and told residents in the small town of Apgar on Lake McDonald that they might have to leave. Other campgrounds, the historic Lake McDonald Lodge and private cabins along Going-to-the-Sun Road are already under evacuation orders. Brothers Craig and Sean Simpson, and their father, Henry, were evacuated from their campground Sunday, the Missoulian reported. "It's kind of scary, being woken up and told you have to evacuate," Craig Simpson told the newspaper. Sean Simpson commended Glacier staff for their handling of the situation. "They got us out with plenty of time to be safe, and we felt taken care of." The Simpsons had arrived from New England on Saturday. While they had to relocate to Apgar Campground and cancel their plans to hike in the North Fork, they still planned to stay for five nights. Businesspeople who serve tourists in the park said the fire has already hurt them. "The smoke is what's affecting us," Glacier Outfitters co-owner Shelby Handlin Hampton told the Missoulian. The fire deterred Glacier visitors from the outdoor activities that her shop supports. The fire in Glacier National Park comes as officials said a wildfire near California's Yosemite National Park has been fully contained following a recent weekslong closure. Yosemite's closure came at the height of tourist season, costing the park and nearby communities millions of dollars. The park draws more than 600,000 visitors during a typical August, according to the National Park Service.
Residents trapped as gunfire mars ceasefire at Philippines city  [SEP]  related media assets (image or videos) available. Click to see the gallery. 4 related media assets (image or videos) available. Click to see the gallery. Thousands of civilians hoping to flee fighting in the besieged Philippines city of Marawi remained trapped on Sunday after a four-hour ceasefire to evacuate residents was marred by gunfire. MARAWI CITY, Philippines: Thousands of civilians hoping to flee fighting in the besieged Philippines city of Marawi remained trapped on Sunday after a four-hour ceasefire to evacuate residents was marred by gunfire. Only 134 were freed on Sunday, less than on previous days, despite government hopes that more than 1,000 would be able to leave a city battered by 13 days of intense fighting. Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte predicted the siege would be over within days despite fierce resistance by fighters aligned to Islamic State in the dense urban heart of the southern Philippines city. "This will be over in about three more days," Duterte said on Saturday after visiting a hospital in Cagayan de Oro where wounded soldiers were being treated. "I will not hesitate to use every power available." About 400 local militants reinforced by about 40 foreign fighters stormed Marawi on May 23, using sophisticated battlefield tactics to take control of large swaths of the lakeside city. They have been pushed back to the city centre by Philippines forces over the past week after some 4,000 ground troops were bolstered by helicopters and aircraft deploying rockets and bombs. Many residents have told Reuters that the airstrikes caused extensive property damage and dozens of civilian deaths. Authorities lifted the civilian death toll from 20 to 38 on Sunday - but said all those deaths were caused by militants. A presidential spokesman said 120 militants had died, along with 38 government forces. Duterte said the use of air power had been restrained so far. "I can end this war in 24 hours," he said. "All I have to do is to bomb the whole place and level it to the ground." Duterte has asked the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), an Islamic separatist movement based on the Philippines island of Mindanao, to help negotiate a peace settlement with the Islamist fighters, who are predominantly drawn from the Maute Group based in and around Marawi. Marawi, dubbed the "Islamic City of Marawi", is also located on Mindanao, which has a large Muslim population in a predominantly Catholic country and been destabilised by separatist insurgencies for decades. MILF cadres organised Sunday's ceasefire, which was to run from 8 am until noon. They roamed the streets with loud hailers urging residents to leave. But by 9am, gunfire had broken out, apparently deterring residents from joining a mass exodus. Marawi City's mayor Majul Gandamra, told reporters on Sunday morning he was expecting "more or less 1,000 plus to be rescued today". In the end, 134 were evacuated, less than previous days when there were no ceasefires. About 2,000 civilians remain in the city. Irene Santiago, appointed by Duterte to organise the "peace corridor", said the effort had been a success, noting the fighting was several kilometres away from where the evacuation took place. She said negotiations were continuing with the Maute for another temporary ceasefire on Monday.

Video: 'Extreme mate!' Surfers brave the swells as Cyclone Gita hits West Coast  [SEP]  A couple of keen Kiwi surfers on the West Coast have made the most of massive swells whipped up by Cyclone Gita today, as they braved the elements to catch some waves.

"The wind is offshore so it's perfect for it, the cyclone adds to it, it's what it's about, extreme mate!" Dion said. The pair say if the winds pick up too much they would head for the safety of the shore.
IS suspects stand trial for Iran attacks  [SEP]  Twenty-six alleged members of the Islamic State group went on trial in Iran on Saturday over attacks last year on parliament and the tomb of revolutionary leader Ruhollah Khomeini, local media reported. Seventeen people were killed and dozens injured in the simultaneous attacks in Tehran on June 7 — the first claimed by IS inside Iran. The judiciary-linked Mizan news agency said several of the accused were Iranians who had left to join IS in neighbouring countries and returned for the attacks. Five attackers were killed on the day, but police said at the time that five people had been arrested at the scenes of the attacks in central and south Tehran. Dozens more arrests were reported in the following months — many in operations along the borders with Iraq and Turkey. There were few details from the first day of the trial, which was held in the presence of the victims’ families. Most of Iran’s population is Shiite, and therefore considered heretics by the Sunni jihadists of IS, who have increasingly called for attacks on the country. Iran has also supported the governments of Iraq and Syria against IS and other jihadist insurgents.
Trump open to meeting North Korea's Kim again despite lack of denuclearization progress  [SEP]  (CNN) -- White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Monday that President Donald Trump is open to another meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un despite national security adviser John Bolton's assertion that the US is still waiting for Pyongyang to take steps toward denuclearization. Trump has received another letter from Kim, which Sanders described Monday as "very warm" and "very positive," noting that the White House will not release the letter unless Kim agrees. The primary intent of the letter, she said at Monday's briefing, was to "request and look to schedule another meeting" between the two leaders, something the White House is "open to." She said that the White House is "already in the process of coordinating" another meeting, but declined to provide further details on a time or location. She cited the letter as "further evidence of progress" toward denuclearization, noting that the latest parade was "not about their nuclear arsenal." The letter, she said, showed a "commitment to continuing conversations." Sanders' comments came hours after Bolton said Trump has "tried to hold the door open" for Kim to denuclearize, but the US is still waiting on Pyongyang to take those steps. "President Trump tried to hold the door open to Kim Jong Un and his regime if they would denuclearize," Bolton said, adding "but President Trump can't make the North Koreans walk through the door he is holding open. They are the ones that have to take the steps to denuclearize and that is what we are waiting for." According to Bolton, Kim told South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April that he could denuclearize North Korea "in one year." Bolton also noted Monday that he "thought they could do it even more quickly." Last week, Bolton spoke with his South Korean counterpart, National Security Office director Chung Eui-yong and received a "comprehensive report of Ambassador Chung's September 5 visit to Pyongyang." South Korean officials also said last week that Kim has "unwavering trust for President Trump" and wants to achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula before the US leader finishes his term. "This trust, despite some difficulties surfaced during the negotiation process between the US and the North, will continue," said South Korean special envoy Chung Eun-yong, who met with Kim in Pyongyang on Wednesday. Over the weekend, North Korea celebrated its national day with a series of massive spectacles glorifying 70 years of rule by the Kim dynasty Sunday, but held back on any mention of its nuclear weapons program -- a possible signal of support for Pyongyang's ongoing negotiations with the United States.

Nissan seeks to block Ghosn's access to apartment in Rio | Malay Mail  [SEP]  TOKYO, Dec 9 ― Nissan said it was seeking to block former chairman Carlos Ghosn's access to an apartment in Rio de Janeiro, citing a risk that the executive, arrested and removed from his role for financial misconduct, may remove or destroy evidence. Brazilian-born Ghosn has been detained in Tokyo since his November 19 arrest on suspicion of conspiring with former Nissan Representative Director Greg Kelly to understate his compensation by about half of the actual ¥10 billion (RM366 million), over five years from 2010. Tokyo authorities extended their detention until the maximum December 10 for the alleged crime. A Brazil court has granted Ghosn access to the property, owned by Nissan, in the Copacabana neighbourhood, but the company said in a statement today that it was now petitioning a higher court to reverse the decision. “Nissan has been cooperating with authorities to investigate misconduct on the part of its former chairman, and is working to prevent the destruction of any potential evidence that could occur by allowing access to residences in question,” a Nissan spokesman said. A person close to the Tokyo prosecutors' office told Reuters that Ghosn, Kelly and Nissan itself will be indicted as early as Monday. “Nissan identified serious misconduct related to the reporting of Mr. Ghosn's compensation. The company has been providing information to the Japanese Public Prosecutors Office and has been fully cooperating with its investigation. We will continue to do so,” the Nissan spokesman said. ― Reuters
Florida couple finds message in bottle from 1980s Scotland.  [SEP]  The concept of find a message in a bottle sound whimsical enough on its own. But finding a message in a bottle that was sent over 30 years ago from Scotland enters a whole different stratosphere of remarkable. This unlikely scenario is precisely what happened to Florida residents Ruth and Lee Huenniger when they happened upon a message in a bottle lying under a fence near the Atlantic Ocean. The message itself was sent in the 1980s by a class of students from Forfar, Scotland who were learning about pirates. "We are learning all about pirates. We would like to see how far this message goes. Please write and tell us where you found this bottle. We are class 213, Chapelpark Academy Street," the message reads. Surprisingly well preserved, the Huennigers were not only able to read the decades old message, but they were able to decipher the return address and send a return letter. The letter's paper was covered in transpaseal to preserve it from water damage.
Iran’s Rouhani Leads by Wide Margin in Presidential Election  [SEP]  An Iranian newspaper, Didban Iran, cited a source in the know who said Rouhani’s main challenger Ebrahim Raisi was at 14 million votes. Vote count got underway in Iran past midnight after the polling was extended several times for six hours on Friday amid a massive turnout. A total of four candidates are running, with Rouhani projected to be reelected.
Dutch Justice Minister Resigns Weeks Before Elections.  [SEP]  The Dutch security and justice minister resigned Thursday amid allegations that he was involved in withholding information from lawmakers, a potentially damaging blow to the administration of Prime Minister Mark Rutte less than two months before a national election. Security and Justice Minister Ard van der Steur quit days after a new book presented evidence of his involvement in drafting responses to Parliament's questions about a deal prosecutors made with a drug trafficker in 2000. Opposition lawmakers used a debate on the still-disputed deal in the lower house of Parliament Thursday to attack the credibility not only of Van der Steur, but also of his political boss, Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Populist anti-Islam lawmaker Geert Wilders, whose Party for Freedom is riding high in polls ahead of the March 15 election, called Rutte "by a long way, the most untrustworthy premier the Netherlands has had in a long time." The deal at the heart of the discussion happened 17 years ago and involved a convicted drug trafficker who was paid millions of guilders by prosecutors who said they actually were trying to strip him of his criminal profits. The long-running controversy has been a thorn in the side of Rutte's government. A previous justice minister and his deputy quit over their roles in the scandal. Van der Steur's alleged actions happened in 2015, when he was still a lawmaker. Van der Steur said he made annotations to a draft of written responses to lawmakers' questions, but denied advising the government to withhold any information from Parliament. Van der Steur choked with emotion as he told lawmakers that he wanted to use Thursday's debate to defend himself before quitting, saying that his ministry and others in the Dutch security services need a minister who enjoys the full trust of Parliament. "I don't feel that trust," he said. Rutte, who defended the minister during the debate, patted Van der Steur on the back and hugged him as he left the chamber.

Mayor says SpaceX to build new rocket in Port of Los Angeles  [SEP]  Mayor says SpaceX to build new rocket in Port of Los Angeles LOS ANGELES (AP) — SpaceX has chosen to manufacture its planned big, new rocket in the Port of Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced Monday in his annual state-of-the city speech. The mayor said it's a "vehicle that holds the promise of taking humanity even deeper into the cosmos than ever before." The city Board of Harbor Commissioners will vote Thursday on whether to lease 19 acres to SpaceX for the manufacturing site. The commission's staff has recommended approval of an initial 10-year term, with two 10-year options, at an annual rent of approximately $1.38 million. While SpaceX calls its existing rockets Falcons, CEO Elon Musk simply refers to the planned new rocket as the BFR. It's intended to serve all purposes, from missions into Earth orbit and out to the moon and Mars. Musk has said he aspires to launch his first cargo missions to Mars in 2022. Musk also proposes to use the BFR for high-speed trips from point-to-point on Earth, such as New York to Shanghai in 39 minutes. SpaceX, based in the Los Angeles suburb of Hawthorne, already uses the Port of Los Angeles for missions that recover Falcon 9 first-stage boosters on a floating platform in the Pacific and when it recovers supply capsules that parachute into the ocean after missions to the international space station. "SpaceX has called the Port of Los Angeles home to our west coast recovery operations since 2012 and we truly appreciate the City of Los Angeles' continued partnership," Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX president and COO, said in a statement. "As announced today by Mayor Garcetti, the Port will play an increasingly important role in our mission to help make humanity multi-planetary as SpaceX begins production development of BFR — our next generation rocket and spaceship system capable of carrying crew and cargo to the Moon, Mars and beyond." The agenda for this week's Harbor Commission meeting says the SpaceX's new operation in the port would be a research, design and manufacturing facility for rockets and spacecraft. "The rockets, once complete, would be too large for reasonable transport by road and thus must be transported by barge or ship, necessitating that the facility be water adjacent," it says. The facility would have potential to employ 700 people. Associated Press writer Michael R. Blood contributed to this report.
China plans to launch world's first "artificial moon" over city to light up night sky  [SEP]  The world's first artificial moon could be launched by 2020, China Daily reports. China's space industry is preparing to put an artificial moon into orbit over the city of Chengdu. The fake moon is expected to be launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in China's Sichuan province. The artificial moon will act as a nightlight. Similar to the real moon, the artificial one will have a reflective coating that deflects sunlight to the Earth — only it will shine eight times brighter than the real moon, scientists say, according to China Daily. The object has a planned orbit of about 310 miles above Earth. That's much closer than the real moon, which orbits an average distance of about 239,000 miles from our planet. The artificial moon will be brighter than the one we're used to, according to Wu Chunfeng, head of Tian Fu New Area Science Society in Chengdu, who spoke to China Daily. It could replace some streetlights in Chengdu, which will help conserve energy, but it won't light up the entire night sky. The location and brightness of the "moonbeams" can be controlled and targeted to light up specific areas, the news outlet reported. Live Science reports that little is known about the height, size and true brightness of the proposed artificial moon — all of which could affect its visibility. If the launch of this moon is successful, three more could follow in 2022, Wu told China Daily. Wu estimated the city of Chengdu could save around $174 million (1.2 billion yuan) in electricity ever year if the artificial moon illuminated 31 square miles of the city. Artificial moonlight could also serve other purposes, he suggested, like illuminating disaster zones during blackouts.
Horror scenes in Paris as May Day riots break out  [SEP]  MORE than 200 people have been arrested in Paris as a May Day trade union rally erupted in violence. Police used water cannon and tear gas as about 1500 hooded and masked rioters tore through the city setting fire to businesses and vehicles. A McDonald’s restaurant and Renault garage in the east of the city were ransacked and set alight, while riot police were attacked with rocks. This year’s traditional May Day protests were intended as a message of defiance at president Emmanuel Macron’s efforts to reform and modernise labour laws. In a bid to stimulate the stagnant French economy and reduce unemployment, he has been making it easier for bosses to fire workers while limiting cushy work conditions, leading to outrage from the unions. Philippe Martinez, leader of the hard-Left CGT union, said last night: ‘If we do nothing, the government will not back down.’ Unions put the number of peaceful protesters at the May Day rally at about 55,000, though police said it was just under 20,000 — a figure well down on previous years. Many of the rioters were believed to be members of Left-wing anti-capitalist movement Black Bloc. Social media posts had announced that yesterday would be a ‘Revolutionary Day’ to coincide with other demonstrations across Europe. A Paris police spokesman said: ‘They have mainly targeted places of business, including branches of McDonald’s and banks.’ Interior minister Gerard Collomb said ‘the violence was completely unacceptable’, adding that ‘everything was being done to arrest’ those responsible. Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said there was particular anger at protesters covering their faces. He added: ‘When you have sincere convictions, you demonstrate with your face unmasked. Those who wear hoods are the enemies of democracy.’ This year’s May Day also fell on the 50th anniversary of the 1968 spring riots in France, when president Charles de Gaulle fled to Germany as the country came close to civil war and economic collapse.
Monday’s Leftovers: Who should Notre Dame’s fourth captain be? And DeShone Kizer heads to the Green Bay Packers  [SEP]  Last week, Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly named three captains for the 2018 season. He also said he would hold a team vote for a fourth captain by the end of spring practice. That naturally leads to some speculation as to who could prevail in that balloting. Kelly indicated “six or seven” players were in the mix after the first tally this spring, the one that made captains out of fifth-years Drue Tranquill, Sam Mustipher and Tyler Newsome. Considering which seniors stand out as productive playmakers, which fifth-years were invited back to contribute and thus create a roster crunch, and who led the offseason “SWAT” teams, a few frontrunners emerge. The Irish have long had multiple leaders along the offensive line, and fifth-year right guard Alex Bars could join Mustipher as a team-wide captain. Similarly, fifth-year tight end Nic Weishar returned despite not yet being a vital piece of the passing game — instead, Kelly has often cited Weishar’s influence within the tight end group and the offense as a whole. The returns of rising seniors Te’von Coney and Jerry Tillery, each opting to forgo the NFL draft, certainly made Notre Dame’s defense a force to be reckoned with as far as paper is concerned. Usually, when a player up the middle comes off a strong junior season and opts to return, a captainship may soon follow, but both Coney and Tillery have faced disciplinary issues during their Irish careers. Such could jeopardize a captainship from an administrative standpoint, no matter how a player vote turns out. Rising senior cornerback Nick Watkins is leading one of those spring SWAT units. Watkins may otherwise be off the possible captain radar, but that position of leadership has been an indicative piece of data the last two years. Exhibit A: Newsome led a group each of the last two years, bringing him to a more prominent role in the locker room than a punter may usually have. Rising senior quarterback Brandon Wimbush heads a SWAT team, as well, as a co-leader with Weishar. Naming Wimbush a captain coming out of spring would create some level of expectation of him being the starting quarterback, something Kelly does not intend to establish before August, at the earliest. Of course, Wimbush’s play, or rising junior Ian Book’s subpar play, could force that issue before then. That makes six candidates. Rising junior cornerback Julian Love (pictured above) could be a seventh. Love has comported himself well both on and off the field in his two years as a starter, and he may not be around to be a captain as a senior. This is nothing but idle speculation, but it is spring break and the conversation is intriguing, at the least. Mustipher on new o-line coach Jeff Quinn The verdict on Quinn’s promotion to fill the void left by Harry Hiestand will not be returned until November, at the earliest. Until then, the opinions of Mustipher and the rest of the offensive line are the best clues to Quinn’s interactions with the offensive line. When asked about Quinn on Tuesday, there was no chance Mustipher would offer anything but praise, but some insight can be gained by what praise Mustipher provided. “He brings a motivational and inspirational energy to the offensive line room,” Mustipher said. “He understands the way the standard needs to be set.” That is pretty generic to start. Mustipher then spoke of the “privilege” of being part of the interview process, along with Bars. It would seem the two made it clear to Kelly they wanted not only consistency in message and system, but also some investment in that approach. “We understand that standard of excellence,” Mustipher said. “We wanted a guy that wanted to be here and wanted to coach, and that it meant a lot to him to be here.” Kizer to the Green Bay Packers Former Irish quarterback DeShone Kizer was traded to the Green Bay Packers from the Cleveland Browns on Friday for a cornerback, per the NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport. Without a doubt, getting away from the Browns will be good for Kizer, but do not presume he will ever throw many passes on the shores of Lake Michigan. In trading oft-injured cornerback Damarious Randall, the Packers not only received Kizer, but they also moved up in both the fourth- and fifth- rounds in next month’s NFL draft. That alone may have been enough incentive to move on from a defensive back who publicly feuded with an assistant coach last season. Securing a contract-controlled backup quarterback solidified the deal, and it is likely Kizer is never more than a backup for the Packers. Starting quarterback and future Hall of Famer Aaron Rodgers is only 34. He should have another four or five or even more years left in his career. Kizer’s contract, meanwhile, expires after the 2020 season. If he minds his manners, learns from Rodgers and makes a few cameos in the next three seasons, then perhaps an opportunity elsewhere will await Kizer. Knowing the NFL and its preference for the newest inventory, though, this may be a step toward a career as a backup for the 2017 second-round draft pick. Kizer finished his rookie season with 2,894 yards, 11 touchdowns and 22 interceptions on 255-of-476 passing in 15 games. He added 419 rushing yards and five touchdowns on 77 attempts with nine fumbles sprinkled in. Kudos to Oklahoma With the Sunday night reveal of the NCAA men’s basketball bracket, Oklahoma continued a rather impressive streak. The Sooners athletic department is the only one in the country that can claim AP Top-10 finishes in football and men’s basketball tournament teams in each of the last two years. For that matter, Oklahoma actually managed the double in 2015, as well. ‘Inside the Irish’ March Madness Pool Every online community has a bracket pool. On good days, this space is an online community. Thus, applying logic, it should have a bracket pool. There is nothing at stake except for bragging rights and a chance to embarrass this scribe by finishing well ahead of him. What more could one possibly need? For the sake of being different, the group will utilize a Fibonacci scoring sequence (2-3-5-8-13-21) with a seed-difference upset bonus throughout the Tournament. At least with Notre Dame out of the bracket, the group’s results will not be skewed by unrealistic Irish hopes. Speaking of Notre Dame not making it … The Irish did not have much of a résumé, injuries or no injuries. Looking at analytical measurements, though, Notre Dame appeared to have a much better chance than Syracuse, who squeezed in as the last at-large team. The Irish were the first team left out. The differences between the two? Well, aside from Notre Dame winning at the Carrier Dome while without their two best players? The Irish have the nation’s No. 28 offense when adjusted for efficiency, per Ken Pomeroy. The Orange have the No. 128 offense, offsetting it with the No. 11 adjusted defense. It was indeed that difference that helped Syracuse to a 55-52 win over Clemson in its March 3 regular-season finale, a credentials-boosting victory the likes of which Notre Dame did not have.

Oregon's broken healthcare exchange to shift to federal network  [SEP]  A state that fully embraced the Affordable Care Act, Oregon endured one of the rockiest rollouts of President Barack Obama's healthcare law, requiring tens of thousands of applicants to use paper forms since launching on October 1. Managers of the state exchange, Cover Oregon, determined it would cost about $78 million to fix the beleaguered exchange, well above the projected cost of switching over to the federal system. On Friday, the Cover Oregon Board of Directors voted unanimously to accept a recommendation by a technology advisory group to shift the private insurance side of the program to the federal exchange. The Medicaid portion will move to the Oregon Health Plan. "I don't know that anybody sitting in the room was excited about the proposal that's getting put forth, but at least my impression felt like it was the best option that we had in front of us for those constraints," Cover Oregon Board of Directors Chairwoman Liz Baxter said. For Medicaid consumers, the transition should appear seamless, officials said. But it was unclear how the shift to the federal exchange for private insurance would play out. "We know what we have. We need to speak with the folks in Washington and find out how we could do that," Cover Oregon spokesman Alex Pettit said. The transition could mean some Cover Oregon employees lose their jobs, said Clyde Hamstreet, Cover Oregon interim executive director. Cover Oregon has 190 full time and 270 temporary employees. Officials did not rule out the possibility of one day returning to a state based exchange. Several Cover Oregon officials, including two past directors of the program, have resigned in recent months amid an independent investigation that found mismanagement of the system and a failure to report problems from the beginning. Oregon is not alone. Officials in Maryland and Massachusetts also considered shifting their state-run exchanges to the federal network after experiencing technical problems. Maryland ultimately kept its exchange intact using special technology developed by Connecticut to manage the system, at a cost of about $45 million, Pettit said.
Four Palestinians killed in Gaza by 'mysterious explosion'  [SEP]  Four Palestinians have been killed and several others were injured in a mysterious blast in the south-east part of the Gaza Strip, Gaza's health ministry said. The explosion struck a three-wheeled vehicle on Saturday near one of the five protest camps the Palestinians have set up along the volatile Gaza-Israel border in recent weeks. The reason for the explosion near the city of Rafah was not immediately known. The Israeli military said it has no information on the blast. Thirty-five Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since the mass border protests began on March 30, including 28 who have been shot dead. Gaza's ruling militant Hamas group is organising the protests to promote the Palestinian refugees' "right of return" to Israel, but it is also driven by the dire living conditions.

Trump fires Veterans Affairs Secretary Shulkin  [SEP]  President Donald Trump is firing Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin and replacing him with the White House doctor in the wake of a bruising ethics scandal and a mounting rebellion within the VA. Trump tweets that he intends to nominate "highly respected Admiral Ronny L. Jackson, MD, as the new Secretary of Veterans Affairs." Trump says Robert Wilkie, an undersecretary at the Defense Department, will serve as acting VA secretary until Jackson is confirmed Shulkin is the second Cabinet secretary to depart over controversies involving expensive travel, following former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price's resignation last September. Trump says he is "thankful for Dr. David Shulkin's service to our country and to our GREAT VETERANS!"
Bank of America picks Dublin as EU hub post Brexit  [SEP]  LONDON, July 21 (Reuters) - Bank of America has become the first Wall Street bank to pick Dublin to be its new base for its European Union operations as Britain prepares to leave the bloc, the firm said in a statement on Friday. International banks are planning to set up subsidiaries in the EU to ensure they can continue to serve clients if their London operations lose the ability to operate in the bloc after Britain leaves in March 2019. Details of banks' Brexit arrangements are starting to emerge following a July 14 deadline for them to submit details of their contingency plans to the Bank of England. "Bank of America has operated in Ireland and engaged in the local community for almost 50 years," said Brian Moynihan, Chairman and CEO of Bank of America. The bank did not say how many roles would be moved or created in the Irish capital, where it currently has over 700 staff and a fully licensed entity, but said that some roles would also move to other EU locations. The announcement follows news this week that Wall Street's Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley have picked Frankfrut as bases for the EU hubs post Brexit.

Trudeau Mulls Running for Member of Parliament Next Year  [SEP]  “We’ve accomplished a lot since 2015, but there’s still more work to do, together. So today, I’m excited to accept the nomination as the 2019 Liberal Party of Canada | Parti libéral du Canada candidate for Papineau,” Trudeau wrote on his Facebook page on Sunday. Trudeau, 46, has been heading the Liberal Party since 2013. In 2015, he became the 23rd prime minister of Canada. He has been member of the Canadian parliament for the Papineau federal electoral district in Montreal since 2008. Moreover, the United States has earlier filed separate disputes at the World Trade Organization challenging tariffs imposed on US goods by Canada and other countries as a retaliation to the Trump administration originally imposing steel and aluminum tariffs. Meanwhile, the most recent survey carried out this year by the Mainstreet Research showed that majority of Canadians prefer Trudeau's policies, describing Canadian Prime Minister as "honest and intelligent."

Trump signs Russia sanctions bill  [SEP]  The bill is one of the first major pieces of legislation that was sent to Trump's desk, and it represents a rebuke of the President by giving Congress new veto power to block him from removing Russia sanctions. The White House announced the signing shortly after 11 a.m. ET, saying the bill includes "a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions" that "purport to displace the President's exclusive constitutional authority to recognize foreign governments, including their territorial bounds." In a separate statement, Trump said he believed the bill to be "seriously flawed" but signed it anyway. "Still, the bill remains seriously flawed -- particularly because it encroaches on the executive branch's authority to negotiate," he said in the statement. "Congress could not even negotiate a health care bill after seven years of talking. By limiting the executive's flexibility, this bill makes it harder for the United States to strike good deals for the American people, and will drive China, Russia, and North Korea much closer together." He ended the statement by saying: "I built a truly great company worth many billions of dollars. That is a big part of the reason I was elected. As President, I can make far better deals with foreign countries than Congress." Even before Trump signed the bill, the measure prompted Russian President Vladimir Putin to retaliate against the US over the new sanctions, which Congress levied over Russian interference in the 2016 US election, as well as Russia's annexation of Crimea and aggression in Syria. In addition to the new US sanctions on Russia, former President Barack Obama seized two Russian compounds in New York and Maryland in December in response to the election meddling. Russia responded by ordering the US to cut staff at its diplomatic mission by 755 employees, as well as seizing two US diplomatic properties. The new sanctions bill hits Russia's energy and defense sectors, and also includes fresh sanctions against Iran and North Korea. The measure was signed into law after it passed with overwhelming margins in both the House and Senate -- which made the threat of a presidential veto a non-starter -- but it was not an easy road to Trump's desk. After the Senate passed the sanctions on Iran and Russia 98-2, the bill languished in the House for more than a month amid a series of procedural fights. Then the House added North Korean sanctions before passing the measure 419-3, effectively forcing the Senate to swallow the new sanctions in order to get the legislation over the finish line before Congress left for its August congressional recess. The House and Senate struck a deal to make some changes to the bill at the urging of a host of US industries and European countries, but Congress did not consider making the change that the White House wanted: removing the congressional review on Russia sanctions from the bill. White House officials lobbied to weaken the section giving Congress a veto on the easing of sanctions, and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned Congress the administration should have "flexibility" to negotiate with Russia and improve relations. But key Republican and Democratic lawmakers said that weakening congressional review was not on the table when they were finalizing the legislation. Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker, who initially was hesitant to pass a Russia sanctions bill before he was a key driver to get it done in July, said he has spoken to the President about the review process to try to ease the White House's concerns. Corker said that Congress would only veto an attempt to lessen sanctions on Russia if the administration took an "egregious" step to try to remove sanctions. "I've walked the President through the process of how congressional review works," Corker said. "The administration -- knowing that unless it's way out of bounds -- likely they have the flexibility to do what they need to do." Corker noted that Trump has refused to believe his intelligence leaders that Russia interfered with the election, and said that may have helped push Congress to get the bill done quickly. "I do think that the lack of strong statements in that regard probably effected the outcome," he said.
Philippines president 'respects' Indonesia's stance on drug smugglers  [SEP]  The president of the Philippines has said he 'respects' Indonesia's decision when it comes to the execution of convicted Filipino drug smuggler Mary Jane Veloso. President Rodrigo Duterte met with Indonesian president Joko Widodo in a bilateral meeting in Jakarta last week. President Duterte, known as 'The Punisher' for his war on drugs, has ordered for thousands of traffickers to be killed since he came to power, and has spoken in favour of reviving the death penalty to combat drugs in the Philippines. It was reported in the Jakarta Post that Duterte had told Widodo to execute Ms Veloso during the meeting. However, a statement released by the Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs on Monday said President Duterte had not given the so-called 'green light' for Ms Veloso's execution. Duterte is instead saying he told the Indonesia president he respects the country's judicial process and will accept whatever the final decision is regarding her case. Mr Duterte reportedly told Mr Widodo in the meeting: 'Follow your own laws, I will not interfere'. Philippines Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay said Ms Veloso's execution has been indefinitely deferred. Ms Veloso was arrested at Adisucipto Airport in Yogyakarta, Indonesia in April 2010 carrying a suitcase lined with 2.6kg of heroin and was sentenced to death. The mother-of-two was moments away from facing the firing squad in 2015 when she was granted a temporary reprieve, after a woman suspected of recruiting her was arrested in the Philippines. Legal proceedings against the alleged recruiter are ongoing in the Philippines, while the Indonesian government, which has some of the world's toughest anti-drug laws, say Ms Veloso's death sentence for drugs trafficking still stands. The debate surrounding Ms Veloso's fate comes as shocking images have emerged of drug users in Parola Compound in Tondo, one of the largest districts in Manila. The shanty area or informal settler community is home to thousands of people that survive in poor living conditions. One picture shows the lifeless, bloodied body of a man lying facedown on a bamboo floor, while police are pictured standing over him. Another image shows a man slumped in a corner on a straw mat, cigarettes, a gun and other drug paraphernalia lying within reach. A third image shows a bloodied man sitting slumped, with his head hanging backwards among dirt floors and exposed concrete blocks.
Firefighters say 19 dead in fire at Guatemala orphanage  [SEP]  The spokesman for Guatemala's volunteer fire departments says at least 19 people have been found dead at the scene of a fire in a troubled orphanage near Guatemala City. Spokesman Mario Cruz tells the Emisoras Unidas radio station that firefighters are still extinguishing parts of Wednesday's blaze. But he says that so far 19 bodies have been found and about two dozen people are being treated for injuries. The orphanage has been criticized for overcrowding, alleged abuse and escapes in the past.
Singapore Postcard: Double trouble and media frenzy  [SEP]  SINGAPORE (AP) — The small island nation of Singapore, which prides itself on law and order, is feeling the pressure of more than 3,000 members of the press arriving for a historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The heavy media presence along with stringent security measures for the summit Tuesday has added to the frenzy unusual for the laid-back tropical state. For over a week, journalists have been staking out Singapore’s luxury hotels, airports and government buildings to catch a glimpse of officials involved in summit preparations. Unruly ones have already crossed red lines. Police said Friday they arrested two South Korean journalists from the national broadcaster KBS suspected of trespassing in the residence of the North Korean ambassador.
Polish group sues Argentine paper under new Holocaust law  [SEP]  WARSAW (Reuters) - A Polish campaign group is suing an Argentine newspaper it says breached a new law that makes it a criminal offence to suggest Poland was complicit in the Holocaust. In what appeared to be the first legal action under the so-called Holocaust law, just hours after it took effect, the Polish League Against Defamation said it filed a complaint against Argentina’s Pagina 12 daily. The paper said it had not received formal notice of the lawsuit. A minister from Poland’s conservative government applauded the move to invoke the law which Warsaw says will protect it from slander, but which the United States and Israel said would suppress authentic historic research and free speech. The League, a non-governmental group that campaigns to protect Poland’s historical reputation abroad, said that in December 2017 Pagina 12 used a photograph of Polish so-called‘doomed soldiers’ who fought against communists after the war to illustrate an article on the Jedwabne pogrom of 1941 in which Nazi occupiers and local inhabitants colluded in the massacre of at least 340 Jews. “The combination of these two threads: information about the crime on Jews in Jedwabne during the German occupation and the presentation of fallen soldiers of the independence underground is manipulation, an act to the detriment of the Polish nation,” the organization said in a statement. The ruling Law and Justice party has praised the‘doomed soldiers’. While many are seen as national heroes in the struggle against Soviet domination, some led killings of Jews, Belarusians and other minorities. In an article posted on its website on Saturday evening, Pagina 12 said,“this newspaper did not receive any legal communication and only learned of the information through international news agency reports.” “If successful, this attempt at international censorship could threaten freedom of expression worldwide,” the article read. Deputy Justice Minister Michal Wojcik said he hoped the case would go to court. “The organization has a right to submit such a notice. If the court decides the complaint is admissible - and it should do so — then there will be a court case,” he told private radio station Zet. Jews from across Europe were sent to be killed at death camps built and operated by Germans in occupied Poland — home to Europe’s biggest Jewish community at the time — including Auschwitz, Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor. Some 3 million Jews who lived in pre-war Poland were murdered by the Nazis, accounting for about half of all Jews killed in the Holocaust. Thousands of Poles risked their lives to protect Jewish neighbors during the war. But research published since the fall of communism in 1989 showed that thousands also killed Jews or denounced those who hid them to the Nazi occupiers, challenging the national narrative that Poland was solely a victim. According to figures from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the Nazis, who invaded Poland in 1939, also killed at least 1.9 million non-Jewish Polish civilians.
Sweden military draft returns, adds women  [SEP]  COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Sweden's left-leaning government instituted a military draft for both men and women Thursday because of what its defense minister called a deteriorating security environment in Europe and around Sweden. Sweden abolished compulsory military service for men in 2010 because there were enough volunteers to meet its military needs. It has never had a military draft for women. The government said "the all-volunteer recruitment hasn't provided the Armed Forces with enough trained personnel. The reactivating of conscription is needed for military readiness." In September, non-NATO-member Sweden stationed permanent troops on the Baltic Sea island of Gotland. Defense Minister Peter Hultqvist described the move as sending a signal after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea and its "increasing pressure" on the neighboring Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. There have also been reports of airspace violations by Russia's military aircraft in the Baltics and a military buildup in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, which sits across the Baltic Sea from Sweden. About 20,000 people now work for the Swedish armed forces, 84 percent of them men and 16 percent women, according to the forces' website. But the armed forces lack 1,000 active troops as well as 7,000 reservists, according to Sweden's coalition government of Social Democrats and Greens. Under the plan approved Thursday, at least 4,000 18-year-olds could be called up each year. Swedes will still be able to volunteer for military service. The Swedish government, which often has described itself as feminist, said "modern conscription is gender-neutral and will include both women and men." Hultqvist said he had been inspired by neighboring Norway, which in 2013 introduced a law applying military conscription to both sexes. That made Norway the first NATO member to draft both men and women, joining a handful of countries around the world, including Israel. Conscription was introduced in Sweden in 1901, but gradually wound down and was formally canceled 109 years later. During the Cold War era, nearly 85 percent of Swedish men were drafted into the army due to the nearby threat of the Soviet Union. The average term of service was about 11 months. In 2015, Sweden's military expenditure dropped to 1.1 percent of its gross domestic product, down from 2.5 percent in 1991 as the Cold War came to an end, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. On Tuesday, Micael Byden, head of Sweden's armed forces, said an additional $718 million, or a 15 percent budget boost, was needed to increase the country's military's capabilities in the coming years. This was to be added to the $5 billion the government had earmarked for 2017.
Nawaz to reach Lahore in three days  [SEP]  Punjab Information Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman has on Tuesday said that disqualified former prime minister Nawaz Sharif will reach Lahore in three days during his GT road show. The Punjab information minister said that the decision to change the program had been taken on ‘public pressure’, adding that the journey to Lahore via GT Road would be completed at least in three days. Earlier, Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal met Nawaz Sharif and presented him a report of the federal agencies regarding the security situation. The Interior Minister suggested the disqualified former prime minister not to go ahead with his planned road show.
USS Fitzgerald's leaders removed from their duties over June collision  [SEP]  The commanding officer, executive officer and senior non-commissioned officer of the USS Fitzgerald have been removed from their duties for cause amid the fallout surrounding the deadly collision between the USS Fitzgerald and a cargo ship off the coast of Japan on June 17. "We've lost trust and confidence in their ability to lead in those positions and they will not return to the ship," Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. William Moran told reporters at the Pentagon late Thursday. The 7th Fleet also said several junior officers were relieved of duty. While the final investigation into the collision is ongoing, Moran said: "We do not have to have the investigation complete to start the process." The Fitzgerald's commanding officer, Cdr. Bryce Benson, and the executive officer, Cdr. Sean Babbiit, were both sleeping, and the master chief petty officer, Brice Baldwin, were not on the bridge at the time of the collision, according to the Navy. The bow of the cargo ship directly struck the commander's cabin, according to the Navy's report detailing the immediate aftermath of the collision. The report said Benson "was hanging from the side of the ship" when he was retrieved by crewmembers who were forced to use a sledgehammer, kettlebell and their bodies to break through the door and gain access to the heavily damaged cabin. Benson was medically evacuated via helicopter due to the severity of his injuries and he placed on limited duty status on July 11. "There are a lot of sailors" who have undergone the non-judicial punishment process and "survived and done well," Moran said, but "when you look at what happened here, it's going to be pretty hard to recover from this." "Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew," Moran said, adding that "clearly at some point the bridge team lost situational awareness." One additional sailor has already undergone the captain's mast. Several other sailors are due to go through the process, including the people who were on watch that night. The Navy also plans to review its training and qualification procedures in the wake of the deadly collision, in which the Fitzgerald was heavily damaged. It will have to be brought back to the US for repairs. "The collision was avoidable and both ships demonstrated poor seamanship. Within Fitzgerald, flawed watch stander teamwork and inadequate leadership contributed to the collision that claimed the lives of seven Fitzgerald sailors, injured injured three more, and damaged both ships," the 7th Fleet said in a statement. The Navy's report on the immediate aftermath provides a harrowing account of US sailors attempting to escape a rapidly flooding sleeping area that filled with water within minutes after the cargo ship's bow tore a hole in the side of the Fitzgerald. Of the 35 sailors in the sleeping area at the time of the collision, 28 were able to escape, but the remaining seven sailors died. The report describes a chaotic scene following the collision between the Fitzgerald and the much larger cargo ship. Some sailors were thrown from their beds, while others remained asleep. Sailors ran through the sleeping area, attempting to awaken their still-sleeping crew members. "At least one sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up," the report said, referring to the Naval term for a bed. The crew had to move quickly to escape the area using a ladder before the sleeping area became completely flooded, with the report saying the room "was nearly flooded within a span of 30 to 60 seconds." "By the time the third sailor to leave arrived at the ladder, the water was already waist deep," the report said. Rear Adm. Charles F. Williams wrote in the memo accompanying the report that the sailors in that sleeping area "should be commended for their response to the dangerous and deadly threat they faced." Moran said the investigation will have to be completed before any medals or awards can be adjudicated to any sailors for acts of heroism. An acting commanding officer had been assigned to the Fitzgerald following the collision, and a permanent replacement, Cdr. Garrett Miller, has been identified and is expected to take command soon. The full investigation will have to be completed in order for the Navy to assign responsibility for the collision.
Saudi Arabia Breaks 35-Year Cinema Ban With Historic 'Black Panther' Screening  [SEP]  Black Panther has become the first commercial film to be given a public screening in Saudi Arabia for 35 years. Marvel's already culturally groundbreaking blockbuster on Wednesday screened at AMC's first Saudi site in Riyadh's King Abdullah Financial District, the first movie movie theater to open in the kingdom since a ban on cinemas lifted in December. Numerous cinemas had been present in Saudi Arabia in the 1970s, but these were closed in the early '80s as the country adopted extreme conservative forms of Islam. Earlier questions regarding issues of segregation appear to have been answered by a photo from the event showing both men and women sitting together. The Saudi government has recently relaxed enforcement of laws banning co-mingling between unrelated men and women, although it still remains a grey area. "The return of cinema to Saudi Arabia marks an important moment in the Kingdom’s modern-day history and cultural life, as well as in the development of the Kingdom’s entertainment industry," said Awwad Alawwad, Saudi minister of culture and information. "Cinema has always played an important role in bringing cultures together and Saudi Arabia is ready to play its part." The cinema in Riyadh – a specially-fitted conference hall – is the first of up to 100 hundred multiplexes AMC plans to open in the coming years, and one of around 350 Saudi Arabia hopes will have opened by 2030, generating approximately $1 billion in box office spend each year. "At AMC we have around 1,000 theaters and 11,000 screens across the globe – but none of them have caught the world’s imagination like this one," said AMC CEO Adam Aron. "When I talked to people around the world in recent weeks it was clear that this is a historic event."

Cosby lawyers detail 11 alleged trial errors as they appeal  [SEP]  Cosby, once revered as "America's Dad" for playing the beloved Dr. Cliff Huxtable on "The Cosby Show," could spend a decade in prison, given the way O'Neill fashioned his sentence. The three-year minimum appears well within the 1- to 4-year state guidelines. But O'Neill attached an unusual 10-year maximum, which could keep Cosby from getting parole unless he acknowledges his sexual offenses and completes sex-offender therapy. O'Neill, based in part on expert testimony about other accusers, judged Cosby a "sexually violent predator" and said his wealth and power made it possible he could still reoffend. The label makes Cosby subject to police registration and community alerts should he be released from prison.
Hurricane Lane: Hawaiians brace, with nowhere to run  [SEP]  HONOLULU — Hawaii residents emptied store shelves Wednesday, claimed the last sheets of plywood to board up windows and drained gas pumps as Hurricane Lane churned toward the state. The category 4 storm could slam into the islands Thursday with winds exceeding 100 mph (161 kph), making it the most powerful storm to hit Hawaii since Hurricane Iniki in 1992. Unlike Florida or Texas, where residents can get in their cars and drive hundreds of miles to safety, people in Hawaii are confined to the islands and can't outrun the powerful winds and driving rain. Instead, they must stay put and make sure they have enough supplies to outlast prolonged power outages and other potential emergencies. "Everyone is starting to buckle down at this point," said Christyl Nagao of Kauai. "Our families are here. We have businesses and this and that. You just have to man your fort and hold on tight." Living in an isolated island state also means the possibility that essential goods can't be shipped to Hawaii if the storm shuts down ports. "You're stuck here and resources might not get here in time," Nagao said. The National Weather Service said Lane is expected to make a gradual turn toward the northwest Wednesday, followed by a more northward motion into the islands on Thursday. "The center of Lane will move very close to or over the main Hawaiian Islands from Thursday through Saturday," the weather service said. The Big Island was already starting to see Lane's first effects Wednesday, Gov. David Ige said at a news conference. The hurricane's outer rain bands were bringing showers to some parts of the island, said Matt Foster, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The eastern side of the island picked up nearly 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) of rain in three hours, while there was light rain in other areas, Foster said. "Heavy rain in Hilo right now," Hawaii County Managing Director Wil Okabe said of the east side town. But on the west side, "nothing. It's a nice day." A look at the cone representing the possible tracks Hurricane Lane could take as it approaches Hawaii. The times are in Hawaii–Aleutian Standard Time. (Credit: NOAA) Public schools were closed for the rest of the week and local government workers were told to stay home unless they're essential employees. Shelters were being readied to open on Oahu, Maui, Molokai and Lanai. Officials said they would open shelters on other islands when needed. Officials were also working to help Hawaii's sizeable homeless population, many of whom live near beaches and streams that could flood. Maui County officials warned that those needing to use Molokai's shelter should get there soon because of concerns that high surf could make the main highway on the south coast of the island impassable. Hawaii Emergency Management Agency Administrator Tom Travis said there's not enough shelter space statewide. He advised those who are not in flood zones to stay home. Many residents were trying to reinforce older homes made with single-wall construction. "We're planning on boarding up all our windows and sliding doors," Napua Puaoi of Wailuku, Maui, said after buying 16 pieces of plywood from Home Depot. "As soon as my husband comes home — he has all the power tools." Molokai real estate agent Pearl Hodgins said she expected the island's two stores to soon run out of bottled water and batteries. Melanie Davis, who lives in a suburb outside Honolulu, said she was gathering canned food and baby formula. "We're getting some bags of rice and of course, some Spam," she said of the canned lunch meat that's popular in Hawaii. She was organizing important documents into a folder — birth and marriage certificates, Social Security cards, insurance paperwork — and making sure her three children, all under 4, have flotation devices such as swimming vests — "just in case." Meteorologist Chevy Chevalier said Lane may drop to a Category 3 by Thursday afternoon but that would still be a major hurricane. "We expect it to gradually weaken as it gets closer to the islands," Chevalier said. "That being said, on our current forecast, as of the afternoon on Thursday, we still have it as a major hurricane." Puaoi said Home Depot opened at 6 a.m., and employees reported there was already a line around the building. "We are fully stocked," she said. "We have about nine cases of water because we're having family stay with us as well, so one case per person." The U.S. Navy was moving its ships and submarines out of Hawaii. All vessels not currently undergoing maintenance were being positioned to help respond after the storm, if needed. Navy aircraft will be kept in hangars or flown to other airfields to avoid the storm. The central Pacific gets fewer hurricanes than other regions, with about only four or five named storms a year. Hawaii rarely gets hit. The last major storm to hit was Iniki in 1992. Others have come close in recent years. "When it did happen, I just remember, pandemonium, it was all out craziness," she said.

Sri Lanka top court rules parliament dissolution as illegal in setback for president  [SEP]  Sri Lanka's Supreme Court on Thursday ruled President Maithripala Sirisena's decision to dissolve parliament ahead of its term as illegal, in a setback for the embattled leader in his face off with an elected premier. COLOMBO: Sri Lanka's Supreme Court on Thursday ruled President Maithripala Sirisena's decision to dissolve parliament ahead of its term as illegal, in a setback for the embattled leader in his face off with an elected premier. Sirisena dissolved parliament on Nov. 9 and called a general election for Jan. 5 days after sacking Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and naming opposition leader Mahinda Rajapaksa to the post. But the court rejected that decision. "President can't dissolve parliament before four-and-half years," Supreme Court Judge Sisira de Abrew said. The court verdict means parliament elections will be held as scheduled after February 2020 and raises the possibility of Wickremesinghe reinstated as prime minister since his coalition enjoys a majority in parliament.
Venezuela 'crushes military rebellion' near Valencia  [SEP]  Senior ruling party official says situation under control at Paramacay military base as authorities arrest seven. Troops in Venezuela have put down an attack on an army base near the city of Valencia, officials have said, shortly after a video surfaced of uniformed men declaring a military rebellion there. Diosdado Cabello, the Socialist Party's deputy, said troops acted quickly on Sunday to quash the assault at the Paramacay base. Military chiefs said the rebels, whom they described as "terrorists," were trying to steal weapons and that seven people were detained after the attack. The armed forces "successfully repelled a paramilitary criminal terrorist attack, the 7 captured is giving information!" Rear Admiral Remigio Ceballos, head of the military's strategic operational command, said on Twitter. The announcement came after a small group of men dressed in military fatigues, some armed with assault rifles, released a video declaring an uprising in Carabobo state, where Valencia is located. In the video, a man identifying himself as Captain Juan Caguaripano said that any unit refusing to go along with its call for rebellion would be declared a military target. "We demand the immediate formation of a transition government," Caguaripano said. He was flanked by about a dozen men in military uniforms. "This is not a coup d'etat," he said. "This is a civic and military action to re-establish constitutional order. But more than that, it is to save the country from total destruction." One witness in the area told the Reuters news agency of hearing gunshots before dawn. The Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Venezuela has been rocked by a wave of anti-government protests in the past several months that have left more than 100 people dead. The reported attack in Paramacay comes two days after government allies inaugurated a new legislative superbody that the opposition and dozens of countries denounced as a power grab by President Nicolas Maduro. In its first act on Saturday the Constituent Assembly ordered the dismissal of the country's attorney general, Luisa Ortega, a vocal government critic. The opposition is struggling to regain its footing in the face of the government's tactics and re-emergence of old, internal divisions.
Latest: Firm tracks Nassar coverage, bills university $500K  [SEP]  EAST LANSING, Mich. — The Latest on the Larry Nassar sexual abuse case (all times local): Michigan State University paid roughly $500,000 to a public relations firm for work in January tracking media coverage and social media activity related to the case of disgraced former sports doctor Larry Nassar. The Lansing State Journal reports Wednesday that New York-based Weber Shandwick billed the university $517,343 for 1,440 hours of work done by 18 employees. The figures came from documents obtained by the newspaper through a public records request. The firm outlined and evaluated related news coverage and engagement on social media posts. The work previously had been done by university employees, though some of that continued alongside the outside firm’s work. A Michigan State spokeswoman says the university no longer works with Weber Shandwick. She didn’t provide a reason. Nassar is serving a decades-long prison sentence for molesting patients and possessing child pornography. Roughly 200 women gave powerful courtroom statements against him earlier this year. Lawyers for Michigan State University and more than 200 girls and women say they will restart talks that could lead to a settlement in civil lawsuits related to sexual abuse by former sports doctor Larry Nassar. In a court filing Tuesday, both parties say they are scheduling mediation with Layn Phillips, a former federal judge in Oklahoma. The filing was made on the same day Nassar’s former boss, ex-medical school dean William Strampel, was charged with crimes stemming from the Nassar investigation. Strampel is accused of failing to properly supervise Nassar and committing his own sexual misconduct. Lawsuits have been filed against Michigan State, campus officials, USA Gymnastics and a Lansing-area gymnastics club. Nassar’s victims say complaints about the doctor were ignored for years. Nassar is serving decades in prison for sexual abuse and possessing child pornography.
Hundreds of South Koreans to enter North to reunite with loved ones  [SEP]  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — About 200 South Koreans and their family members prepared to cross into North Korea on Monday for heart-wrenching meetings with relatives most haven’t seen since they were separated by the turmoil of the Korean War. The weeklong event at North Korea’s Diamond Mountain resort comes as the rival Koreas boost reconciliation efforts amid a diplomatic push to resolve a standoff over North Korea’s drive for a nuclear weapons program that can reliably target the continental United States. The temporary reunions are highly emotional because most of those taking part are elderly people eager to see their loved ones once more before they die. Most of these families were driven apart during the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended in a ceasefire, not a peace treaty, leaving the Korean Peninsula still in a technical state of war. Buses carrying the elderly South Koreans attending this week’s reunions arrived at a border immigration office Monday morning. Red Cross workers wearing yellow vests waved at them. Some were in wheelchairs and others were aided by workers as they got off the buses and moved to the South Korean immigration office in the eastern border town of Goseong. After undergoing immigration checks, they were to cross the border by buses and travel to Diamond Mountain. Past reunions have produced powerful images of elderly Koreans crying, embracing and caressing each other. Nearly 20,000 people have participated in 20 rounds of face-to-face reunions held between the countries since 2000. Another 3,700 exchanged video messages with their North Korean relatives under a short-lived program from 2005 to 2007. No one has had a second chance to see their relatives. According to Seoul’s Unification Ministry, 197 separated South Koreans and their family members will take part in the first round of reunions that run from Monday to Wednesday. Another 337 South Koreans will participate in a second round of reunions from Friday to Sunday. South Korea will also send dozens of medical and emergency staff to Diamond Mountain to prepare for potential health problems considering the large number of elderly participants. Many of the South Korean participants are war refugees born in North Korea who will be meeting their siblings or the infant children they left behind, many of them now into their 70s. Park Hong-seo, an 88-year-old Korean War veteran from the southern city of Daegu, said he always wondered whether he’d faced his older brother in battle. After graduating from a Seoul university, Park’s brother settled in the North Korean coastal town of Wonsan as a dentist in 1946. After the war broke out, Park was told by a co-worker that his brother refused to flee to the South because he had a family in the North and was a surgeon in the North Korean army. Park fought for the South as a student soldier and was among the allied troops who took over Wonsan in October 1950. The U.S.-led forces advanced farther north in the following weeks before being driven back by a mass of Chinese forces after Beijing intervened in the conflict. Park learned that his brother died in 1984. At Diamond Mountain, he will meet his North Korean nephew and niece, who are 74 and 69, respectively. “I want to ask them what his dying wish was and what he said about me,” Park said in a telephone interview last week. “I wonder whether there’s a chance he saw me when I was in Wonsan.” During the three years since the reunions were last held, the North tested three nuclear weapons and multiple missiles that demonstrated a potential of striking the continental United States. North Korea has shifted to diplomacy in recent months. Leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, a son of North Korean war refugees, agreed to resume the reunions during the first of their two summits this year in April. South Korea sees the separated families as the largest humanitarian issue created by the war, which killed and injured millions and cemented the division of the Korean Peninsula into the North and South. The ministry estimates there are currently about 600,000 to 700,000 South Koreans with immediate or extended relatives in North Korea. But Seoul has failed to persuade Pyongyang to accept its long-standing call for more frequent reunions with more participants. The limited number of reunions cannot meet the demands of divided family members, who are now mostly in their 80s and 90s, South Korean officials say. More than 75,000 of the 132,000 South Koreans who have applied to participate in reunions have died, according to the Seoul ministry. Analysts say North Korea sees the reunions as an important bargaining chip with the South, and doesn’t want them expanded because they give its people better awareness of the outside world. While South Korea uses a computerized lottery to pick participants for the reunions, North Korea is believed to choose based on loyalty to its authoritarian leadership.

Decoding the thoughts of patients who can't even blink  [SEP]  You can hear those around you, but you can't speak. You can feel a touch, but you can't touch back. You can see, but you can't move, even to blink your eyes. That's the life of a completely locked-in patient, someone who has brain function but complete paralysis, which can be caused by stroke, traumatic brain injury, medication overdose or diseases of the circulatory or nervous system, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease). It was generally thought that completely locked-in patients were unable to communicate with the outside world -- but a new study has showed otherwise. An international team of scientists has communicated with completely locked-in patients using a noninvasive brain-computer interface system. The researchers used the system to decode the patients' thoughts while the patients were asked yes or no questions, according to the study, published in the journal PLOS Biology on Tuesday. Niels Birbaumer, a researcher at the Wyss Center for Bio and Neuroengineering in Switzerland and lead author of the new study, said he wasn't surprised by the findings. "No surprise, but pleasure," Birbaumer said. "One patient's family is using it regularly," he said of the new system. "With some training, every caretaker of average intelligence can learn it." To decode what patients were thinking, the system involved functional near-infrared spectroscopy, a tool that can measure blood flow and oxygenation in the brain, and an electroencephalography (EEG) cap, which can measure electrical activity in the brain. "Since no other technique allows any communication with these subjects, this can be considered to be an important advance," said Andrew Schwartz, distinguished professor of neurobiology at the University of Pittsburgh who was not involved in the new study. Four patients -- a 68-year-old woman, a 76-year-old woman, a 61-year-old man and a 24-year-old woman -- who were in completely locked-in states participated in the study. Over several weeks, the researchers repeatedly asked the patients "yes or no" or "true or false" questions while the patients were connected to the communication system. As the patients thought about their answers, the researchers analyzed changes in the system's measurements to determine whether the patient was thinking about a yes or no response. The mental states for yes or no were different due to oxygenation changes, but the system could not decipher specific letters or words. The researchers first asked the patients to respond to questions or statements with known answers, such as "You were born in Berlin," "Your husband's name is Joachim," "Paris is the capital of Germany" or "Paris is the capital of France." The patients responded correctly at a rate of about 70%, the researchers found. Once the researchers determined that the patients were trained on how to respond to the questions, they repeatedly asked open questions with no known answers, such as "Are you happy?" The researchers found that the patients repeatedly answered quality of life questions with a "yes" response, indicating that they had a positive attitude toward life. A total of at least 200 known questions and 40 open questions were constructed for the patients with input from family members. Birbaumer and his colleagues had used only near-infrared spectroscopy to communicate with just one completely locked-in patient in 2014 and published their findings in the journal Neurology. He said the new findings mark about 25 years of research. The new study was successful in showing a creative approach to establishing some communication with completely locked-in ALS patients, said Dr. Brian Litt, a professor and director of the Penn Center for Neuroengineering and Therapeutics at the University of Pennsylvania. "Their conclusion is, this could be a promising, minimally invasive technology that you could use," said Litt, who was not involved in the new study. "I think it's pretty convincing that they could get 'yes or no' answers out of these patients. Now, whether they could get to more sophisticated results, like being able to get language or being able to type, for example, from just your thoughts, that takes more research," he said. "Keep in mind what the goal would be. The goal would be for somebody to think their thoughts and really give you more meaningful communication." Some researchers have used implantable brain chips or blinking as a way to communicate with locked-in patients, depending on the severity of the patient's locked-in state. Though some locked-in patients have some control of their eye movements, those who are completely locked-in have lost such control. One of the earliest-known records of locked-in syndrome appeared in Alexandre Dumas' 1844 novel "The Count of Monte Cristo," in which Noirtier de Villefort suffers a stroke and is unable to move and speak but can control his eyes, exhibiting symptoms of being locked-in (PDF). Another well-known locked-in case occurred more recently. After French journalist Jean-Dominique Bauby suffered a massive stroke in 1995, he lost the ability to move and speak but could control his eyes, exhibiting a locked-in state. Locked-in syndrome is thought to affect about 1% of stroke victims, although the number could be underestimated. Before he died in 1997, Bauby authored a memoir about his condition, "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly." He produced the book by blinking to indicate which letters his transcriber should use to write. The memoir, which was turned into a 2007 film, was written with about 200,000 blinks. At Northeastern University in Boston, students developed a brain-computer communication device in 2014 that allowed a locked-in patient to control an on-screen keyboard with only his eyes in order to type messages. The patient would blink to select certain letters on the screen and put them into sentences. "We still regularly get contacts from people all around the world who ask, 'Where can I buy this device?' " said Waleed Meleis, associate professor and associate chairman of the department of electrical and computer engineering at Northeastern University, who advised students. The device is not on the market for sale or use. In the past few years, more communication systems intended for locked-in patients have emerged, including the brain-computer interface system demonstrated in the new study. Meleis was impressed by the study's thoroughness, he said. "Usually in computer science, you train a computer to do something using machine learning. But here, they are training a person who cannot communicate to manipulate their brain states to produce an answer," Meleis said of the authors of the new study, with which he was not involved. "They're tackling a problem that is real and very challenging," he said. Meleis thinks it will still take time before any such communication device may be commonly used with locked-in patients. First, research needs to be replicated and conducted in real-world settings, he said. "There is a long way to go," he said. "Many of these users are not in hospitals; they are in nursing homes or care facilities. So I think there's another leap to be made to adapt these processes to the lifestyles of a user, but I think we're going to get there." Additionally, more research is needed to ensure that questions can be asked to patients with a higher accuracy, as in the new study, patients answered known questions with only a 70% correct response rate. 'This would give patients that power' The extent to which brain-computer technology might be used with completely locked-in patients may depend on how easily and economically the technology can be transformed for real-world settings with everyday caregivers, said Gerwin Schalk, associate professor at the University of Albany School of Public Health and research scientist at the National Center for Adaptive Neurotechnologies. "The biggest barriers to widespread use are probably the economics of the substantial cost of developing and maintaining the system, combined with the fact it only really helps very few people, so it's sort of like an orphan drug. ... It's very helpful but only to very few people," said Schalk, who was not involved in the new study. "There are also important ethical implications," he added. For instance, doctors might recommend that a patient's life support be terminated, but then a brain-computer interface might allow that patient to communicate that he or she still wants to live. What should happen next? Such brain-computer interfaces can put the power to make decisions about their own care back into patients' control, said Dr. Karunesh Ganguly, associate professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco and a staff neurologist at the San Francisco Veterans Affair Medical Center. "It certainly allows the possibility for this noninvasive communication to have important implications for these types of patients' care," Ganguly said of the new study, with which he was not involved. "Often, for example, for medical care, you need to be able to gain consent," he said. "This would give patients that power to make choices about their own care."
Bulgaria's first communications satellite launched into orbit  [SEP]  SOFIA: Bulgaria's first geostationary communications satellite has been launched into space, operator Bulsatcom said in a statement on Saturday. The BulgariaSat-1 satellite, which will provide television and communication services to Europe and North Africa, was launched by SpaceX from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 1910 GMT on Friday. The satellite could be also used in force majeure situations - accidents due to natural disasters - such as earthquakes, storms and floods when land-based networks are not operational. "When we started this space project more than 10 years ago, we clearly knew that what was need to complete it successfully was patience, commitment and a strong team," said Maxim Zayakov, CEO of Bulgaria Sat and Bulsatcom. "We launched our BulgariaSat-1, we stepped up a as one of the leading space nations in Europe and opened the path for the development of the related Bulgarian high-tech sectors and talented specialists." The satellite will be positioned into orbit at 36,000 km (22,000 miles) above the Earth and be operational up to 20 years. Over the next month, the ground control room will carry out the necessary tests and settings to make the satellite operationally ready to broadcast. Bulsatcom has secured financing for the US$235 million project from the United States' Export-Import Bank and a Deutsche Bank-led consortium of European banks.
Indian Authorities Say Flight Crew Forgot To Pressurize Airplane Cabin  [SEP]  As Jet Airways Flight 9W697 took off from Mumbai on Thursday, something terrifying quickly became clear: The cabin was not properly pressurized. Oxygen masks dropped from the cabin's ceiling. "Thirty out of 166 passengers experienced nose and ear bleeding [and] some also complained of headache," an official with India's Directorate General of Civil Aviation said, according to the Hindustan Times. The flight turned back "due to loss in cabin pressure," according to a statement from the Indian international airline. But as the Hindustan Times reported, the country's civil aviation regulator stated that this happened because, "during the climb, crew forgot to select switch to maintain cabin pressure." Jet Airways says the cockpit crew "has been taken off scheduled duties pending investigation." The Times reported that India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau has launched a probe into the incident, and the airline said it is "extending full cooperation." The flight had been bound for Jaipur, a popular tourist destination in northern India. "I was sitting on an aisle seat when suddenly air pressure in the cabin dropped and oxygen masks came down," passenger Prashant Sharma told India's PTI news agency. "I saw a passenger sitting next to me bleeding from the nose. Several others complained of extreme pain in their ears." Others posted videos from the cabin, showing passengers sitting quietly and breathing through oxygen masks. Several of the passengers complained about a lack of information provided by the crew during the incident. One of them, Satish Nair, stated that the airline staff did not provide passengers with any explanation about what was happening: "no staff to help," he said in a tweet, "...no announcement on board to wear the oxygen mask." He complained that the safety of passengers was being ignored. According to PTI, another unnamed passenger said that the plane "circled overhead for around half-an-hour before landing. There was no announcement (related to the problem) from the crew." The airline said five people were hospitalized and have been released. It added that 144 of the original flight's passengers have been transported to Jaipur on a different flight, and 17 decided "to travel at another point in time." This comes at a somewhat tense moment for the airline – according to Reuters, it is "struggling to cut costs and embroiled in a pay dispute with pilots." Jet Airways "posted a loss of about $189 million for the April-June quarter," the wire service said. And in January, the BBC reported, the airline "grounded two pilots following reports of a fight inside the cockpit of a flight from London to Mumbai." That flight landed safety, the broadcaster added.
False Ballistic Missile Warning Was ‘Unacceptable,’ Underscores Need for Talks With North Korea, Hawaii Rep. Says  [SEP]  The false ballistic missile warning in Hawaii was “unacceptable” and points to a need for President Donald Trump to negotiate with North Korea directly, Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said Sunday. “We’ve got to get to the underlying issue here of why are the people of Hawaii and this country facing a nuclear threat coming from North Korea today, and what is this President doing urgently to eliminate that threat?” Gabbard said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” A false alarm in Hawaii on Saturday warned people to seek shelter due to an inbound ballistic missile threat. State leaders and emergency officials said it was a false message, and Hawaii Gov. David Ige told CNN “an employee pushed the wrong button,” causing the erroneous alert. Gabbard said she wants Trump to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un personally. “I’ve been calling on President Trump to directly negotiate with North Korea, to sit across the table from Kim Jong Un,” Gabbard said, adding that the talks should “happen without preconditions.” She said forcing the precondition that North Korea relinquish its nuclear program would be unlikely and self-defeating, adding that the US must recognize Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons development is informed by decades of US attempts to overthrow foreign governments. “They see it as the only deterrent against the US coming in an overthrowing their regime there,” Gabbard said. Trump has dismissed attempts by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to deescalate the situation through direct talks, and last month the White House reined in Tillerson’s offer to start talks without preconditions. Trump has insulted Kim as “Rocket Man” on Twitter and in a speech before the United Nations, and he has threatened North Korea with “fire and fury.” Kim has insulted Trump and threatened to attack the United States as his country continues to develop and test nuclear weapons and missile systems. In an apparent shift on Wednesday, Trump said he might be willing to have dialogue with North Korea when it’s “appropriate.” ‘Terror all across the state of Hawaii’ Outside of the nuclear threat posed by North Korea, Gabbard said the false alarm highlighted the threat of nuclear war due to mistakes and false information. “It’s not just the President making a decision to launch a nuclear weapon,” Gabbard said. “It’s these kinds of mistakes that we have seen happen in the past that bring us to this brink of nuclear war that could be unintentional.” Gabbard said she was “angry” the false alarm went out and said she was hearing stories from all over Hawaii about the traumatic moments in the wake of the alert. “The fact that these processes failed so epically, that caused this trauma, that caused this terror all across the state of Hawaii, must be fixed immediately, and those responsible for this happening need to be held accountable,” Gabbard said.
Stanton hits No. 50 to help Marlins beat Padres 6-2  [SEP]  MIAMI — Giancarlo Stanton hit his 50th home run to break an eighth-inning tie, helping the Miami Marlins sweep the San Diego Padres with a 6-2 victory on Sunday. Stanton became the first National League player to reach 50 homers since Prince Fielder hit 50 for Milwaukee in 2007. Stanton's 17th homer in August tied him for the second-most in MLB history in the month, behind Rudy York's 18 in 1937. With the score 2-all, Dee Gordon singled to lead off the eighth. Stanton then drove a 2-1 pitch from Clayton Richard (6-13) into the hedge in centre field. The milestone earned Stanton a curtain call from the crowd of 23,725. Fans roars as he celebrated with teammates after returning to the dugout, and he climbed to the top step and waved his batting helmet toward the stands.
BREAKING: 2 dead after helicopter crashes near Charlottesville protests  [SEP]  CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (ABC News) – Two people are dead after a helicopter crashed seven miles southwest of Charlottesville, Virginia, Saturday afternoon, the Virginia State Police said. The National Transportation Safety Board and Virginia State Police are investigating the crash, which took place in a wooded area. Further details were not immediately available. Other media reports say the chopper crash is related to the protests in Charlottesville.
First modern Britons had 'dark to black' skin, Cheddar Man DNA analysis reveals  [SEP]  The first modern Britons, who lived about 10,000 years ago, had “dark to black” skin, a groundbreaking DNA analysis of Britain’s oldest complete skeleton has revealed. The fossil, known as Cheddar Man, was unearthed more than a century ago in Gough’s Cave in Somerset. Intense speculation has built up around Cheddar Man’s origins and appearance because he lived shortly after the first settlers crossed from continental Europe to Britain at the end of the last ice age. People of white British ancestry alive today are descendants of this population. It was initially assumed that Cheddar Man had pale skin and fair hair, but his DNA paints a different picture, strongly suggesting he had blue eyes, a very dark brown to black complexion and dark curly hair. The discovery shows that the genes for lighter skin became widespread in European populations far later than originally thought – and that skin colour was not always a proxy for geographic origin in the way it is often seen to be today. Tom Booth, an archaeologist at the Natural History Museum who worked on the project, said: “It really shows up that these imaginary racial categories that we have are really very modern constructions, or very recent constructions, that really are not applicable to the past at all.” Yoan Diekmann, a computational biologist at University College London and another member of the project’s team, agreed, saying the connection often drawn between Britishness and whiteness was “not an immutable truth. It has always changed and will change”. The findings were revealed ahead of a Channel 4 documentary, which tracked the ancient DNA project at the Natural History Museum in London as well as creating a new forensic reconstruction of Cheddar Man’s head. To perform the DNA analysis, museum scientists drilled a 2mm-diameter hole into the ancient skull to obtain a few milligrams of bone powder. From this, they were able to extract a full genome, which held clues about this ancient relative’s appearance and lifestyle. The results pointed to a Middle Eastern origin for Cheddar Man, suggesting that his ancestors would have left Africa, moved into the Middle East and later headed west into Europe, before eventually crossing the ancient land bridge called Doggerland which connected Britain to continental Europe. Today, about 10% of white British ancestry can be linked to this ancient population. The analysis also ruled out an ancestral link with individuals inhabiting Gough’s Cave 5,000 years earlier, who appear to have performed grisly cannibalistic rituals, including gnawing on human toes and fingers – possibly after boiling them – and drinking from polished skull cups. Britain was periodically settled and then cleared during ice ages until the end of the last glacial period about 11,700 years ago, since when it has been continuously inhabited. Until now, though, it hasn’t been clear whether each wave of migrants was seeded from the same population in mainland Europe; the latest results suggest this was not the case. The team homed in on genes known to be linked to skin colour, hair colour and texture, and eye colour. For skin tone, there are a handful of genetic variants linked to reduced pigmentation, including some that are very widespread in European populations today. However, Cheddar Man had “ancestral” versions of all these genes, strongly suggesting he would have had “dark to black” skin tone, but combined with blue eyes. Scientists believe that populations living in Europe became lighter-skinned over time because pale skin absorbs more sunlight, which is required to produce enough vitamin D. The latest findings suggest pale skin may have emerged later, possibly when the advent of farming meant people were obtaining less vitamin D though dietary sources like oily fish. Cheddar Man would have lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, making sharp blades from flints for butchering animals, useing antlers to whittle harpoons for spear fishing and carving bows and arrows. • First Brit: Secrets of the 10,000 Year Old Man will air on Channel 4 on 18 February
1 dead, 2 injured after Army helicopter crashes in Maryland  [SEP]  A Black Hawk helicopter crashed onto a golf course in Maryland during a routine training flight Monday, killing one crew member and injuring two others, the U.S. Army said. The cause of the crash is under investigation, the U.S. Army Military District of Washington said in a statement Monday evening. "We are deeply saddened by this loss within our community," said Maj. Gen. Bradley A. Becker, commanding general, Joint Force Headquarters National Capital Region and the U.S. Army Military District of Washington. "Our condolences go out to the families and friends affected by this tragedy, and our team is focused on supporting them during this difficult time." Three crew members were aboard the UH-60 Blackhawk. The Army said one person is in serious condition and one is in critical condition. They are being treated at the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore. They were not identified, pending notification of relatives. The aircraft was from the 12th Aviation Battalion, stationed at Davison Airfield, Fort Belvoir, Va. Kevin Bowen, who works in the pro shop of the Breton Bay Golf and Country Club, said he saw the helicopter "flying kind of low" and then "saw it spinning" before it went down between the third and fourth holes of the course in Leonardtown, about 60 miles southeast of Washington, D.C. Dorothy Harper, who lives across the street from the golf course, said she saw the helicopter just before it crashed. "I was outside in my front yard when I saw the helicopter come over right across the street from my house. I saw pieces actually falling off the helicopter," she said. Harper said she didn't see smoke or flames, "just pieces falling out of the sky." Shortly after, emergency vehicles started rolling in, she said. Army investigators were driving around the course in golf carts Monday evening, placing evidence markers near pieces of debris. A team from the Army Combat Readiness Center, in Fort Rucker, Ala., will be on site Tuesday to conduct the investigation, the Army's statement said. The incident comes less than two weeks after a military jet crashed in a wooded area just outside a suburban Washington neighborhood. The pilot, who was on a training mission, ditched his jet. He was treated for minor injuries, and no one else was injured in that incident.
Trump accepts U.S. intelligence on Russia hacking, top aide says  [SEP]  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump accepts the U.S. intelligence community's conclusion that Russia engaged in cyber attacks affecting the U.S. presidential election and may take actions in response, his incoming chief of staff said on Sunday. Reince Priebus said Trump believes Russia was behind the intrusions into the Democratic Party organizations, though he did not clarify whether the president-elect agreed that the hacks were directed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. "He accepts the fact that this particular case was entities in Russia so that's not the issue," Priebus said on "Fox News Sunday." Priebus' comments marked a significant shift away from the repeated dismissals by Trump of Russian interference in the presidential election. The Republican president-elect has rebuffed claims that Russia was behind the hacks or was trying to help him win, saying the intrusions could have been carried out by China or a 400-pound hacker on his bed. It was the first acknowledgment from a senior member of the president-elect's team that Trump has accepted that Russia directed the hacking and subsequent disclosure of Democratic emails during the 2016 presidential election. With less than two weeks to his inauguration, Trump has come under increasing pressure from fellow Republicans to accept intelligence community findings on Russian hacking and other attempts to influence the election. A crucial test of Republican support for Trump comes this week with the first confirmation hearings of his Cabinet picks. A U.S. intelligence report released last week said Putin directed a sophisticated influence campaign including cyber attacks to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and support Trump. The report concluded vote tallies were not affected by Russian interference but did not assess whether it influenced the outcome of the Nov. 8 vote in other ways. 'ACTION MAY BE TAKEN' In a statement on Friday after receiving a briefing from leaders of the U.S. intelligence agencies, Trump did not refer specifically to Russia's role in the presidential campaign. Priebus, the former Republican National Committee chairman who Trump picked to be his chief of staff, said Trump plans to order the intelligence community to make recommendations as to what should be done. "Action may be taken," he said, adding there was nothing wrong with trying to have a good relationship with Russia and other countries. Republican lawmakers pushed back on Sunday on the strategy of cozying up to Putin. Two senior Republican senators urged Trump to punish Russia in response to U.S. intelligence agencies' conclusion that Putin personally directed efforts aimed at influencing the election. Appearing on NBC's "Meet the Press," Senators Lindsey Graham and John McCain said evidence was conclusive that Putin sought to influence the election - a point that Trump has refuted. "In a couple weeks, Donald Trump will be the defender of the free world and democracy," Graham said. "You should let everybody know in America, Republicans and Democrats, that you're going to make Russia pay a price for trying to interfere." On Saturday, Trump wrote on Twitter that having a better relationship with Russia is a "good thing." U.S. Representative Devin Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said it would be nice to make friend with Putin but three U.S. presidents have tried and failed. "I’m just not sure it’s possible," Nunes said on "Fox News Sunday" program. "I’ve cautioned his administration to be careful with Putin, as he remains a bad actor." The ranking Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff, said it was alarming to Democrats and Republicans to hear the president-elect continue to speak in terms of "making nice" with Putin. "It's not realistic and we need to be clear eyed and sober about just what the Russians are about," Schiff said on CNN's "State of the Union."
Darbar move: Jammu and Kashmir Secretariat opens in Srinagar  [SEP]  Civil Secretariat, the seat of the Jammu and Kashmir government, on Monday, opened in Srinagar after functioning in winter capital for six months as part of the nearly 150-year-old practice known in the state as ‘Darbar Move’. Besides the Civil Secretariat, the other offices, including Raj Bhawan, police headquarters and several commissions opened here this morning. Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti inspected the traditional guard of honour given to her by a police contingent at the Civil Secretariat lawns. The practice of the ‘Darbar Move’ – under which the state government functions in Jammu during six winter months and in Srinagar during summer – was started by Maharaja Gulab Singh in 1872 to escape extreme weather conditions in the two regions of the state. However, the practice was continued even after Independence with the aim of providing governance benefits to both the Kashmir and Jammu regions of the state for six months by turns. While Jammu and Srinagar cities benefit from this practice as the roads and other infrastructure get the basic minimum repairs done on annual basis, the ‘Darbar Move’ incurs an expenditure of crores of rupees that could have been used for other productive activities every year. The practice involves moving voluminous files between Jammu and Srinagar and thousands of employees between the two cities in hundreds of buses and trucks. The employees who work in the move offices, as these offices are known in the state, get two weeks of free holidays and compensatory allowances twice every year. Several political parties have in the past demanded to scrap the practice and instead, establishing permanent offices both at Jammu and Srinagar. Even the BJP, the coalition partner in the Jammu and Kashmir government with the PDP, called for abandoning the ‘Darbar Move’ practice last year.
Ethnically Divided Iraqi Town Fears Fresh Conflict After Kurds' Independence Vote  [SEP]  On the eve of the historic referendum on independence, Kurds across the region were celebrating. Young people honked their horns and shot celebratory gunfire into the air of major cities. But not in Tuz Khurmatu, an Iraqi town of more than 100,000 that is violently split among Kurds and Shi'ite Turkmen, who oppose Monday's referendum. "I hope the referendum will be canceled," said Luay, a Turkman shopkeeper in Tuz. "If they don't, the Kurds will take over by force and there won't be any Turkmen or Arabs left." The town is part of the disputed territories, ethnically mixed areas in northern Iraq claimed by both the central government in Baghdad and the autonomous Kurdish government in the north. Each side has tried to consolidate their power over the town since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Kurdish officials have insisted throughout the referendum campaign that all residents of the disputed territories — including Kurds, Arabs, Turkmen and other minorities — would be allowed to vote. However, by Sunday afternoon, the ballot boxes had yet to be distributed throughout the rundown town, which local Kurdish officials attributed to a lack of security forces able to help deploy them safely. Plans had been made to have polling stations in all neighborhoods, said Arslan Ali, a local representative of Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), which has been pushing for the referendum. "We will make it happen," Ali said. This was unlikely, since Tuz Khurmatu is unmistakably split: while Kurdish Peshmerga forces control a Kurdish half, Iran-backed Shi'ite paramilitary groups (PMF) control the Turkmen neighborhoods. "We will not let them approach the Turkmen areas," said Mohammed Mahdi al-Bayati, a senior leader in the Badr Organization, the preeminent PMF force in the area. "They want to seize the disputed territories, but we will not let them." A decision by Kurdish President Massoud Barzani to include these ethnically mixed areas in the plebiscite was widely interpreted as a unilateral move to consolidate Kurdish control. When Islamic State militants overran about one third of Iraq in 2014, the Kurds seized the moment and took over vast areas in northern Iraq, left vulnerable by a fleeing Iraqi army. Peshmerga fighters moved deeper into the disputed territories, including Tuz Khurmatu, which they defended against the militants. But this ignited the Shi'ite Turkmen's fears of being subjected to Kurdish rule. Though PMF-led Turkmen worked together to push Islamic State militants out of Tuz Khurmatu, ultimately the fragile coalition fell apart and led to open hostilities. "The referendum will be the start of a crisis in the disputed territories," al-Bayati said, at a his organization's base in Tuz Khurmatu, where it has been based since 2014. Asked whether his forces would move to prevent such a crisis, al-Bayati made only veiled reference to looming violence: "There will be conflict for sure within 24 hours of the referendum." Walking through the Turkmen neighborhood of Aksu, solid-black flags flutter alongside banners with Shi'ite iconography, a reminder of the somber month of Muharram. The area used to house the main market, where both ethnic groups used to trade. It is now encased in blast walls and guarded by PMF fighters. According to Turkmen residents and shopkeepers, Kurdish shops and houses were burned down, forcing Kurds to move out. "I used to like that it was mixed neighborhood," said Luay, the Turkman shopkeeper. "But then the Kurds killed my brother on this street." A five-minute drive away is the rival Kurdish market, where tri-color Kurdish flags were flying high. It was established by Kurds afraid of the old market. "I used to have lots of Turkmen and Arab friends," said Shalaw, a Kurdish toyshop owner. "Many of the Turkmen have since joined [the PMF], and I'm afraid to cross the city border to go and see them. I'll be killed." Like other Kurds interviewed in the market in al-Jumhuriyah, Shalaw lamented Tuz Khurmatu's split, which he blamed on the PM's arrival. But he said he will vote for independence on Monday. Badr leader Al-Bayati cynically said the referendum suited his group's interests. "Iraq is against the Kurds, so are the Turks, the Iranians, the whole Arab region and Europe. They are going to live in a cage."
SpaceX plans to send two tourists on trip around the moon  [SEP]  Space Exploration Technologies plans to launch two paying customers on a tourist trip around the moon next year using a spaceship under development for NASA astronauts and a heavy-lift rocket yet to be flown, Chief Executive Elon Musk told reporters on Monday. The launch of the first privately funded tourist flight beyond the orbit of the International Space Station is tentatively targeted for late 2018, Musk told reporters on a conference call. Musk declined to identify the customers or say how much they would pay to fly on the weeklong mission, except to say that it’s “nobody from Hollywood.” He also said the two prospective space tourists know each other. “We would expect to do more than one mission of this nature,” he added. “This should be incredibly exciting.” Musk also said that if NASA decides it wants to be first in line for a lunar flyby mission, the U.S. space agency would take priority. At the behest of the Trump administration, NASA is conducting a study to assess safety risks, costs and potential benefits of letting astronauts fly on the debut test flight of its heavy-lift Space Launch System rocket and Orion capsule. That mission is currently planned to be uncrewed and scheduled to launch in late 2018. “If NASA decides that they want to do the first lunar orbit mission, we would obviously give them priority,” Musk said. Musk said the privately funded moon expedition would take place after his California-based company, known as SpaceX, begins flying crew to the International Space Station for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. NASA is hoping those crew-ferrying flights begin by late 2018. SpaceX’s own Falcon Heavy rocket, which Musk wants to use for his own lunar tourist mission, is scheduled to make a debut test flight later this year. Plans call for SpaceX’s two-person lunar venture to fly some 300,000 to 400,000 miles from Earth past the moon before Earth’s gravity pulls the spacecraft back into the atmosphere for a parachute landing. That trajectory would be similar to NASA’s 1968 Apollo 8 mission beyond the moon and back.
Ukraine files case against Russia at UN's highest court  [SEP]  THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Ukraine has filed a case against Russia at the United Nations’ highest court, accusing Moscow of illegally annexing Crimea and illicitly funding separatist rebel groups in eastern Ukraine. Kiev also is seeking compensation for deadly incidents including the 2014 shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. In the case announced Tuesday by the International Court of Justice, Ukraine accused Moscow of “intervening militarily in Ukraine, financing acts of terrorism, and violating the human rights of millions of Ukraine’s citizens.” Kiev further alleged that Moscow’s takeover of Crimea “brazenly defied the U.N. Charter, seizing a part of Ukraine’s sovereign territory by military force.” Fighting between Ukrainian government troops and Russia-backed separatists has killed more than 9,600 people in eastern Ukraine since it began in 2014. Both Ukraine and the separatists are party to a truce under which both should cease fire and stop advancing. Russia has been in control of Crimea since it annexed the Crimean peninsula in March 2014 after a hastily called referendum. No date was immediately announced for hearings in the case, which is likely to take many months to complete. The filing also asked the court to rule that Russia is legally responsible for crimes including the downing of Flight MH17. An international criminal probe concluded last year that a missile that destroyed the Malaysian passenger jet over Ukraine in 2014 and killed all 298 people aboard was fired from rebel-controlled territory by a mobile launcher trucked in from Russia and hastily returned there. Moscow denounced the findings of the Dutch-led inquiry as “biased and politically motivated.” Ukraine also asked the Hague-based world court to order interim measures while the case is going on, including ordering Moscow to halt the transfer of funds and arms to separatist rebels in Ukraine and to stop its persecution of ethnic Tartars in Crimea. Rulings by the court are final and legally binding. Comments WTOP is now using Facebook as our comment platform. Need help? Email us
Ohio State attack: Terrorism eyed as police seek more info  [SEP]  Police stand guard outside a residence of interest during their investigation into an earlier attack at the Ohio State University campus, Monday, Nov. 28, 2016, in Columbus, Ohio. COLUMBUS, Ohio — Investigators are looking into whether a car-and-knife attack at Ohio State University that injured 11 people was an act of terror by a Somali-born student who had once criticized the media for its portrayal of Muslims. The attacker, identified as Abdul Razak Ali Artan, plowed his car into a group of pedestrians on campus shortly before 10 a.m. Monday, and then got out and began stabbing people with a butcher knife before he was shot to death by a campus police officer, authorities said. A motive was not immediately known, but police said they were investigating whether it was a terrorist attack. Artan was born in Somalia and was a legal permanent U.S. resident, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss the case and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The FBI joined the investigation. Ohio State University police Chief Craig Stone said Artan deliberately drove his small gray Honda over a curb outside an engineering classroom building and then began knifing people. Officer Alan Horujko, 28, who was nearby because of a gas leak arrived on the scene and shot the driver in less than a minute, Stone said. Angshuman Kapil, a graduate student, was outside Watts Hall when the car barreled onto the sidewalk. "It just hit everybody who was in front," he said. "After that everybody was shouting, 'Run! Run! Run!'" Eleven victims were taken to three Columbus hospitals. Most had been hurt by the car, and two had been stabbed, officials said. One had a fractured skull. Several prayer vigils were held Monday night to support the victims and the community. Classes at OSU were canceled after the attack, but were scheduled to resume Tuesday. Students said they were nervous about returning and planned to take precautions such as not walking alone. "It's kind of nerve-wracking going back to class right after it," said Kaitlin Conner, 18, of Cleveland, who said she had a midterm exam to take Tuesday. Rep. Adam Schiff, of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said the act bore the hallmarks of an attack carried out by someone who may have been self-radicalized. Ohio State's student newspaper, The Lantern, ran an interview in August with a student named Abdul Razak Artan, who identified himself as a Muslim and a third-year logistics management student who had just transferred from Columbus State in the fall. He said he was looking for a place to pray openly and worried about how he would be received. "I was kind of scared with everything going on in the media. I'm a Muslim, it's not what media portrays me to be," he told the newspaper. "If people look at me, a Muslim praying, I don't know what they're going to think, what's going to happen. But I don't blame them. It's the media that put that picture in their heads." In recent months, federal law enforcement officials have raised concerns about online extremist propaganda that encourages knife and car attacks, which are easier to pull off than bombings. The Islamic State group has urged sympathizers online to carry out lone-wolf attacks in their home countries with whatever weapons are available to them. Artan was not known to the FBI prior to Monday's attack, according to a law enforcement official who was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation and spoke on the condition of anonymity. Neighbors said he was always polite and attended daily prayer services at a mosque on the city's west side. Leaders of Muslim organizations and mosques in the Columbus area condemned the attacks while cautioning people against jumping to conclusions or blaming a religion or an ethnicity. Surveillance photos showed Artan in the car by himself just before the attack, but investigators are looking into whether anyone else was involved, the campus police chief said. Associated Press writers Alicia A. Caldwell and Eric Tucker in Washington, Collin Binkley in Boston and Mark Gillispie in Cleveland contributed to this story.
Kathy Griffin releases photo holding a severed Trump head  [SEP]  LOS ANGELES (AP) — Kathy Griffin says she knew her new photo shoot with Tyler Shields would “make noise.” Griffin appears in a photo posted online Tuesday holding what looks like President Donald Trump’s bloody, severed head. Many on Twitter called for the comedian to be jailed. Griffin tells photographer Tyler Shields in a video on his Twitter page Tuesday that they will have to move to Mexico to avoid federal prison for their latest collaboration. She described the project as an “artsy fartsy statement” on Instagram and says she does not condone causing harm to others. Publicists for Griffin did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. A message sent to Shields through his website was not immediately returned.

Trump: End birthright citizenship for some US-born babies  [SEP]  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump wants to order the end of the constitutional right to citizenship for babies of non-citizens and unauthorized immigrants born in the United States. Trump made the comments to “Axios on HBO” ahead of midterm elections that he has sought to focus on his hardline immigration policies. Trump, seeking to energize his supporters and help Republicans keep control of Congress, has stoked anxiety about a caravan of Central American migrants making its way to the U.S.-Mexico border. He is dispatching additional troops and saying he’ll set up tent cities for asylum seekers. Revoking birthright citizenship would spark a court fight over whether the president has the unilateral ability to change an amendment to the Constitution. The 14th Amendment guarantees that right for all children born in the U.S. Asked about the legality of such an executive order, Trump said, “they’re saying I can do it just with an executive order.” Trump added: “We’re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States.” An excerpt of the interview was posted on Axios’ website on Tuesday. The president said White House lawyers are reviewing his proposal. It’s unclear how quickly he would act on an executive order. In the final days before the Nov. 6 midterms, Trump has emphasized immigration, as he seeks to counter Democratic enthusiasm. Trump believes that his campaign pledges, including his much vaunted and still-unfulfilled promise to quickly build a U.S.-Mexico border wall, are still rallying cries for his base and that this latest focus will further erode the enthusiasm gap. The first line of the 14th Amendment states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.” Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

SpaceX returns to flight, sending satellites into orbit | Reuters  [SEP]  A SpaceX Falcon rocket blasted off from California on Saturday, returning the company to flight for the first time since a fiery launchpad explosion in September.The 230-foot (70-meter) rocket launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base at 9:54 a.m. PST (1754 GMT) to deliver 10satellites into orbit for Iridium Communications Inc. "It's a clean sweep – 10 for 10," SpaceX launch commentator John Insprucker said after the satellites were released.SpaceX founder and entrepreneur Elon Musk's ambitious flight plans had been grounded since the September 1 explosion during fueling ahead of a pre-flight test in Florida.About 10 minutes after Saturday's launch, the first stage ofthe rocket, which had separated from the rest of craft,successfully touched down on a platform in the Pacific Ocean, a feat previously accomplished by four other returning Falconrockets. SpaceX intends to reuse its rockets to cut costs."Rocket is stable," Musk posted on Twitter. "Mission looks good." Two other returning Falcon boosters landed on the ground. The mission tested changes implemented by SpaceExploration Technologies Corp, known as SpaceX, since the launchpad explosion.Accident investigators determined that a canister of heliumburst inside the rocket's second-stage liquid oxygen tank,triggering the explosion. The canister is being redesigned, butuntil then SpaceX is addressing the issue by modifying itsfueling procedures.The explosion destroyed a $62 million SpaceX booster and a$200 million Israeli communications satellite that it was to puti The accident clouded the company's aggressive agenda, whichincludes beginning to ferry U.S. astronauts into space next year, when it also plans to make its first voyage to Mars. Saturday's flight begins to clear a logjam of more than 70 planned missions, worth more than $10 billion, involving SpaceX Falcon rockets, which last flew in August, SpaceX said. The launch is the first in a seven-flight contract with Iridium worth $468.1 million, company spokeswoman Diane Hockenberry said. SpaceX aims to launch 27 rockets in 2017, more than triplethe eight flights the privately held firm managed in 2016,according to a report on Friday in the Wall Street Journal. In addition to its dozens of commercial customers, SpaceX is one of two companies hired by NASA to fly cargo to the International Space Station. The company's 2017 agenda includes the debut launch of a heavy-lift booster, flying its first reused rocket and repairing the Florida launchpad damaged in the explosion.

Japan cult leader's hanging closes chapter on shocking crime  [SEP]  TOKYO (AP) — The executions Friday of a doomsday cult leader and six of his followers closed a chapter on one of Japan's most shocking crimes, the poison gas attack on rush-hour commuters in Tokyo's subway that killed 13 people and sickened more than 6,000. The attack in 1995 woke up a relatively safe country to the risk of urban terrorism. The ensuing raid on the cult's compound near Mount Fuji riveted Japan, as 2,000 police officers approached with a canary in a bird cage. Shoko Asahara, the bearded, self-proclaimed guru who had recruited scientists and others to his cult, was found two months later, hiding in a compartment in a building ceiling. The executions of the 63-year-old Asahara and the six cult members were announced by the Justice Ministry after they had been hanged, as is the practice in Japan. Two major newspapers issued extra editions and handed them out at train stations. "This gave me peace of mind," Kiyoe Iwata, who lost her daughter in the subway attack, told broadcaster NHK. "I have always been wondering why it had to be my daughter and why she had to be killed. Now, I can pay a visit to her grave and tell her of this." The executions were a long time coming, but they were expected as the last trial in the case had been completed and some of the condemned convicts had been transferred to other prisons earlier this year. Six other cult members remain on death row. The subway attack was the most notorious of the cult's crimes, which was blamed for 27 deaths in all. Named Aum Shinrikyo, or Supreme Truth, it amassed an arsenal of chemical, biological and conventional weapons to carry out Asahara's escalating criminal orders in anticipation of an apocalyptic showdown with the government. Japan's justice minister, who approved the hangings Tuesday, said she doesn't take executions lightly but felt these were justified because of the unprecedented seriousness of the crimes the seven committed. "The fear, pain and sorrow of the victims, survivors and their families — because of the heinous cult crimes — must have been so severe, and that is beyond my imagination," Justice Minister Yoko Kamikawa told a news conference. She said the crime affected not only Japan but also sowed fear abroad. The seven executions in one day were the most since Japan began releasing information on executions in 1998. They were hanged in detention centers in Tokyo and three other places, spread out so the executions could be done at once. Japan hangs several people in an average year but keeps the executions highly secretive. The country started disclosing the names of the executed and their locations only 11 years ago. Those executed learn their fate only when they are taken to the gallows. There are 117 convicts on death row. Six of the seven, including Asahara, had been implicated in the subway attack. They included three scientists who led the production of the sarin gas and a man who drove a getaway vehicle. Their other crimes include the 1989 murders of an anti-Aum lawyer and his wife and 1-year-old baby and a 1994 sarin attack in the city of Matsumoto in central Japan, which killed seven people and injured more than 140. An eighth person died after being in a coma for a decade. On March 20, 1995, cult members used umbrellas to puncture plastic bags, releasing sarin nerve gas inside subway cars just as their trains approached the Kasumigaseki station, Japan's Capitol Hill, during the morning rush. Commuters poured out of subway stations in downtown Tokyo, and the streets were soon filled with troops in Hazmat suits and people being treated in first-aid tents set up outside. The convicted also assaulted and murdered wayward followers and people who helped members leave the cult. Asahara, whose original name was Chizuo Matsumoto, founded Aum Shinrikyo in 1984. The cult attracted many young people, including graduates of top universities. During his eight-year trial, Asahara talked incoherently, occasionally babbling in broken English, and never acknowledged his responsibility or offered meaningful explanations. He was on death row for about 14 years. His family has said he was a broken man, constantly wetting and soiling the floor of his prison cell and not communicating with his family or lawyers. They had requested his mental treatment a retrial. Some survivors of the cult's crimes opposed the executions, saying they would end hopes for a fuller explanation of the crimes. Shizue Takahashi, whose husband was a subway deputy station master who died in the attack, also expressed regret that six of Asahara's followers had been killed. "I wanted the others to talk more about what they did as lessons for anti-terrorism measures in this country, and I wanted the authorities and experts to learn more from them," she told a televised news conference. "I regret that is no longer possible." The cult claimed 10,000 members in Japan and 30,000 in Russia. It has disbanded, though nearly 2,000 people follow its rituals in three splinter groups, monitored by authorities. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said authorities are taking precautionary measures in case of any retaliation by his followers. Associated Press journalists Kaori Hitomi and Haruka Nuga contributed to this story.
Swedish parliament ousts PM in vote of no-confidence  [SEP]  STOCKHOLM: Sweden’s centre-right opposition and the far right ousted Prime Minister Stefan Lofven in a vote of no-confidence on Tuesday, as the left and right blocs wrangle over who can form a new government after neither won a majority in September 9 elections. Lofven’s departure was widely anticipated. The head of the opposition four-party Alliance, Ulf Kristersson, has since election night insisted that he intends to try to form a government. With neither bloc able to build a majority, the far-right, anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, who won almost 18 percent of votes in the election and is the country’s third-biggest party, has demanded it be given influence over Swedish politics in exchange for its support in parliament. But neither the left nor right has been willing to negotiate with the Sweden Democrats.“Sweden needs a new government that has broad political support to undertake reforms,” Kristersson told parliament moments before the confidence vote on Tuesday. A total of 204 of 349 members of parliament voted against Lofven, while 142 voted in favour.The speaker of parliament, Andreas Norlen, will begin talks on Thursday with the leaders of the eight parties represented in parliament to determine who is best placed to form the next government. Norlen, a member of Kristersson’s conservative Moderate Party, is widely expected to task Kristersson with the job. But the road ahead is tricky.A collaboration with the Sweden Democrats would give the Alliance the majority it needs, but since that option is unthinkable for two Alliance parties — the Liberals and the Centre — Kristersson has so far refused to go down that route. Lofven’s leftwing bloc holds 144 seats in the new parliament, just one more than the four-party centre-right Alliance.
Former Afghan hostage Joshua Boyle granted bail  [SEP]  OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Former hostage Joshua Boyle will be released from a Canadian jail with strict bail conditions that include an electronic tracking bracelet, a judge ruled Friday. Boyle faces a string of charges, including sexual assault, following his release from captivity in Afghanistan last year. The alleged crimes occurred between Oct. 14 and Dec. 30 after he and his American wife, Caitlan Coleman of Stewartstown, Pennsylvania, returned to Canada. A publication ban bars reporting information that could identify the alleged victims. Ontario Court Justice Robert Wadden issued the bail decision. Under the release conditions, Boyle will live with his parents, Patrick and Linda Boyle in Smiths Falls, Ontario. He must wear a GPS ankle bracelet that can track his movements. Boyle and his wife were taken hostage in 2012 by a Taliban-linked group while on a backpacking trip in Afghanistan. The couple had three children during their five years in captivity. The family was rescued by Pakistani forces last October. Boyle was arrested by Ottawa police in December and charged with offences including assault, sexual assault, unlawful confinement and causing someone to take a noxious substance. Boyle, his wife and children had been living in an Ottawa apartment when he was arrested.
Public warned vs fake earthquake ‘predictions’  [SEP]  Following the 5.5-magnitude earthquake that hit parts of Luzon on Tuesday, state seismologists have warned the public against fake quake predictions making the rounds on social media. READ: 5.5 quake shakes 19 areas in Metro Manila, other parts of Luzon In an advisory on Wednesday morning, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said it “has not made any predictions of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions as a consequence of the earthquake in Batangas.” “Unless you see an announcement from PHIVOLCS Website: phivolcs.dost.gov.ph,PLEASE DO NOT FORWARD information from unverified sources,” Phivolcs said. Fake posts about the “Big One” or a possible magnitude 8 quake that might hit Metro Manila have resurfaced on social networking sites following the Batangas quake, which was also felt in the National Capital Region, Bulacan, Cavite, and nearby areas. Classes in all levels in Batangas and Laguna for Wednesday, April 5, were suspended due to the quake’s aftermath. IDL

Trump Orders American Taxpayers To Pay For His Wall  [SEP]  First, they come for the immigrants, and boy, is Trump taking aim at them today, with the assistance of his nominated Attorney General, Bigot Jefferson Beauregard Sessions. In orders signed today, Trump is undoing the Obama administration's policy of "catch-and-release," taking aim at so-called "sanctuary cities," while putting the spotlight on the victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. According to the order concerning border security, The Wall will be built with taxpayer money, which makes this at least half of a broken promise, despite Trump's claims Mexico will pay for it "in a form" at some point. It reads, "In accordance with existing law, including the Secure Fence Act and IIRIRA, take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border." As for paying for it? Well, there's language for that, too. The appropriate agencies are ordered to "identify and, to the extent permitted by law, allocate all sources of Federal funds for the planning, designing, and constructing of a physical wall along the southern border" While Congress gabbles at each other about how they can't afford Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act, the administration will be sending them budget requests to "project and develop long-term funding requirements for the wall." Taxpayers will also pay for "a comprehensive study of the security of the southern border, to be completed within 180 days of this order, that shall include the current state of southern border security, all geophysical and topographical aspects of the southern border, the availability of Federal and State resources necessary to achieve complete operational control of the southern border, and a strategy to obtain and maintain complete operational control of the southern border." That's the wall. That same order will perk up investors in private prisons in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas as well, because it authorizes them to gear up and build even more detention facilities as needed. The order on immigration enforcement is even more draconian. It provides for the immediate hire of up to 10,000 more immigration officers (jobs!) at taxpayer expense, of course, and in spite of a federal hiring freeze put into effect across the administration. So-called "sanctuary cities" are a particular target. According to the order, such cities will not be eligible for federal grants as determined by the Attorney General. Think about Jeff Sessions in that light -- who also worked closely with Kris Kobach and Steve Bannon to author this. Additionally, the order calls for a public report pertaining only to so-called sanctuary cities to publish a weekly list of "criminal actions committed by aliens and any jurisdiction that ignored or otherwise failed to honor any detainers with respect to such aliens." Sort of a blacklist, you see. These orders do not address those who were covered under President Obama's DACA order protecting children of immigrants brought to the United States who have become eligible for work permits. But give it time. In the meantime, protest actions are springing up. There are marches planned for tonight in New York to protest. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman just released this statement with regard to sanctuary cities: “The President lacks the constitutional authority to cut off funding to states and cities simply because they have lawfully acted to protect immigrant families -- as described in the legal guidance my office issued last week. Local governments seeking to protect their immigrant communities from federal overreach have every right to do so. “Building and maintaining trust between local law enforcement and the communities they bravely serve is vital to ensuring public safety. Any attempt to bully local governments into abandoning policies that have proven to keep our cities safe is not only unconstitutional, but threatens the safety of our citizens. “I urge President Trump to revoke this Executive Order right away. If he does not, I will do everything in my power to fight it.” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has also pledged to resist. Senator Jefferson Beauregard Sessions has not yet been voted on in committee, nor for confirmation on the Senate floor. Now is your opportunity to contact your Senator and urge them to vote NO on his confirmation, especially given his participation in these loathsome, racist executive orders. I will update this post with any more news as it's available. But for now, what we know is that Trump plans to retaliate against urban centers that did not support him via bogus immigration actions and voter fraud investigations, at taxpayers' expense.
Australia no longer isolated as 'Five Eyes' turn on Huawei  [SEP]  When Turnbull's own government banned Huawei from supplying equipment for Australia's 5G mobile networks earlier this year, there was a similar outcry. There were concerns about a diplomatic incident with Beijing, claims of xenophobia, warnings from Huawei's telco customers that it would set back the nation's mobile services, and strongly worded criticism of Canberra in Chinese state-controlled media. All of which is to say, Australia has been out on a limb when it comes to Huawei for quite a while now. But not anymore. In recent weeks, the vendor, which was founded by a former member of the People's Liberation Army, has run into strife in New Zealand, the UK, the US and Canada. As it turns out, these countries, together with Australia, form the 'Five Eyes' intelligence sharing alliance. Overnight, Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Canada and extradited to the US. The shock development emerged just hours after British Telecom, one of the UK's largest internet service providers, said it would remove Huawei's equipment from the core of its mobile networks. Days earlier, the head of Britain's MI6 intelligence agency issued his own stern warning about the company. A profile of Huawei's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou is displayed on a Huawei computer. And just last week, New Zealand's top intelligence agency blocked Huawei from supplying equipment for a 5G network being planned by Spark Telecom. The arrest of Huawei's CFO (who happens to be the daughter of the company's powerful founder) is certain to inflame diplomatic tensions between the US and China. Canada's Globe and Mail, which broke the news of the arrest, said it was based on the belief she had violated America's trade embargo with Iran. Which would mean it is less about cyber-security than trade. But it has hard to disentangle the two, with the US and China engaged in a cold war over trade with tech at its core, and long-term military supremacy potentially at stake. As we recently wrote, the US increasingly views China's technology sector as a strategic threat to the country's dominant position globally. US officials have long bemoaned intellectual property theft by China (something Huawei itself has been accused of engaging in). A key US government agency recently proposed restrictions on exports of emerging technologies that could be critical for the security of America and its allies- similar to the kind of controls it places on exports of weaponry and military equipment. Whoever dominates those advanced technologies - which include artificial intelligence, robotics, and quantum computing - will likely be in a dominant position economically, politically and militarily. In Australia, experts are also concerned about cyber-security attacks against our institutions and businesses emanating from China. For example, consider recent reports in this newspaper that China’s peak security agency directed a surge in cyber attacks on Australian companies over the past year; and that internet traffic heading for Australia was diverted to China for a six-day period. There's no suggestion Huawei is in anyway involved in these attacks. But the government's decision to ban it from Australia's 5G networks was certainly based on concerns about China. "A long history of cyber incidents shows cyber actors target Australia and Australians," Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Mitch Fifield said in their joint statement back in August without directly mentioning China. "The government considers that the involvement of vendors who are likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government that conflict with Australian law, may risk failure by the carrier to adequately protect a 5G network from unauthorised access or interference." In other words, the government was concerned that even if Huawei wasn't directly controlled by the Chinese government (the vendor has always denied that it is), under the country's laws it wouldn't be able to resist any demands made on it by Beijing. Australia is no longer alone on this front. And whether you agree with it or not, Canberra's decision to push back against Huawei looks less and less contentious.
Croatia to face off against France in World Cup final after beating England  [SEP]  MOSCOW — When the final whistle blew and they knew they were going to their first World Cup final, the Croatians ran to their exuberant fans, jumping in their iconic red-and-white checkered jerseys. Mario Mandzukic scored the winning goal in the 109th minute and Croatia shocked England 2-1 Wednesday. Croatia, the first team in 28 years to come from behind to win a World Cup semifinal match, will play France for the title on Sunday in its biggest sporting moment since becoming an independent nation in 1991. France, which won its only title at home in 1998, will have an extra day of rest after beating Belgium 1-0 on Tuesday. Croatia will be coming off its third straight extra-time match. Defender Sime Vrsaljko kept the score even by heading a shot off the goal line about 10 minutes before Mandzukic scored. Kevin Trippier curled in a free kick for England in the fifth minute. Ivan Perisic tied the score in the 68th minute. But football will not be coming home, and there will be no title to match the 1966 triumph at Wembley Stadium. Harry Kane & Co. will deal with the same disappointment that felled Shearer and Platt, Gazza and Wazza, Beckham and Gerrard.
Syrian TV reports Israeli attack near capital Damascus  [SEP]  BEIRUT — Syrian state-run media is reporting an Israeli attack near the capital Damascus, saying Syrian air defenses shot down two missiles. The official news agency SANA says Tuesday night’s attack occurred in the countryside in Kisweh, just south of Damascus. It took place about an hour after President Donald Trump announced he was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, calling Tehran a main exporter of terrorism in the region. An official with the Iran-led axis of resistance said the strike targeted a Syrian army position and caused only material damage. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to give official statements. There was no immediate comment from Israel, which almost never confirms or denies airstrikes in Syria. Iran has vowed to retaliate to recent Israeli strikes in Syria targeting Iranian outposts in the country.
Wall Street set to sink as China trade spat intensifies  [SEP]  (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to open sharply lower on Friday after the United States announced tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, spurring a promise of immediate and equivalent retaliation from Beijing. President Donald Trump said in a statement that a 25 percent tariff would be imposed on an initial list of strategically important imports from China from July 6 and vowed further measures if Beijing struck back. China’s Commerce Ministry said it planned to impose tariff measures of similar size and intensity response. Global financial markets have struggled since February in the face of signs Washington and Beijing were headed toward a trade war after several rounds of negotiations failed to resolve U.S. complaints over Chinese industrial policy, market access and a $375 billion trade gap. “It has gotten investors nervous,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. “It’s going to probably mean a cautious and bumpy ride for the stock markets.” Shares of manufacturers Boeing (BA.N) and Caterpillar (CAT.N) were down more than 1.2 percent in premarket trading, and car makers Tesla (TSLA.O) and General Motors (GM.N) fell 1.1 percent and 0.39 percent, respectively. Investors are also weighing the impact of tightening monetary policy by central banks on the equities market. The U.S. Federal Reserve increased its key interest rate for the second time this year on Wednesday and hinted at the possibility of two more hikes by the end of 2018. The European Central Bank weighed in on Thursday to say it would end its bond-purchase program at year-end, even if any interest rate hike was still distant. At 8:38 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis 1YMc1 were down 174 points, or 0.69 percent. S&P 500 e-minis ESc1 were down 12.75 points, or 0.46 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQc1 were down 21.5 points, or 0.3 percent. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) rose 1.8 percent after a media report that Beijing had already approved Qualcomm Inc’s (QCOM.O) proposed $44 billion acquisition of the chipmaker. Qualcomm was up 0.4 percent. Sources close to the talks have told Reuters that China is yet to approve. Adobe (ADBE.O) shares dropped 3.3 percent after the company projected third-quarter revenue that fell slightly below estimates. Its shares have run up more than 47 percent so far this year.
How Brexit could smash the British pound a second time  [SEP]  Brexit has already slammed the pound once. It could happen again. The currency would be put under severe pressure if Britain crashes out of the European Union next year without striking a deal on trade, according to analysts. "The day after the UK voted for Brexit, the pound suffered the biggest single day loss for a G10 currency in recorded history," said Fiona Cincotta, a senior market analyst at online trading platform City Index. "The pound could potentially replicate this decline." The pound plummeted after Brits voted to leave the European Union, hitting a low near $1.18 against the US dollar in late 2016. The currency has recovered some of its losses, but rising fears of a messy exit have caused it to weaken in recent sessions to $1.27. George Brown, an economist at financial firm Investec, believes the United Kingdom and European Union will get a deal ahead of the deadline in late March. But he warned the pound could fall below $1.10 if an agreement isn't in place. The slow pace of negotiations has heightened fears in recent months that Britain may leave the European Union in March without a transition deal to keep it temporarily in the bloc's single market and customs union. A sharp reaction by the pound is just one potential trouble area. Automakers, grocers and retailers have warned of dire consequences if they're not able to receive the "just in time" deliveries that underpin their supply chains. Stocks are expected to register a more nuanced response than the UK currency. "The stock market is less susceptible to a no-deal outcome than the pound," said David Cheetham, chief market analyst at brokerage XTB. "While there may be a knee jerk reaction lower of 2% to 3%, it is unlikely to experience a large loss." A weaker pound would make it cheaper for foreign investors to buy British stocks, which would help support prices. Many of the largest firms traded on the benchmark FTSE 100 are miners and oil companies, which make the majority of their revenue in foreign currencies outside the United Kingdom. Their earnings will get a boost when foreign sales are translated back into pounds. But not all firms are immune. "Companies which service the domestic market and are most reliant on imports would likely be hardest hit in a no-deal Brexit," said Jonathan Davies, head of currency strategy at UBS Asset Management. Cincotta said that British retailers and manufacturers would also face increased costs to import materials as the lower pound bites and new tariffs are imposed. "Industry-wise, soft drinks, alcoholic drinks and packaged food industries are the most sensitive to the impact of Brexit," said Ugne Saltenyte, a macro analysis specialist at research firm Euromonitor International. Cheetham said that travel companies and airlines could suffer. Brexit could force flight cancellations, and passengers may opt to stay home as they struggle with higher inflation resulting from the weaker pound. UK bonds could also see some big moves. John Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital Economics, said a no-deal Brexit could cause 10-year UK government bond yields to drop from 1.25% to 1% as investors crowd into the safe haven asset. "The yield fell from nearly 1.4% on the eve of the [Brexit] vote to 0.6% in less than two months," he said. "So a drop ... to 1% would not seem out of the question."

Suspected jihadists attack resort outside Mali's capital  [SEP]  BAMAKO, Mali (AP) - Suspected jihadists launched an attack Sunday on a hotel resort in Mali's capital, taking hostages at a spot popular with foreigners on the weekends. The number of casualties was unclear in the assault, which continued through the afternoon, authorities said. Gunfire rang out at the Campement Kangaba on the outskirts of Bamako, according to a security official with the U.N. mission known as MINUSMA. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to journalists. "I heard gunfire coming from the camp and I saw people running out of the tourist site," said Modibo Diarra, who lives nearby. "I learned that it was a terrorist attack." Malian soldiers succeeded in entering the site, according to Commandant Modibo Traore, a spokesman for the Malian special forces in the former French colony. "The operation is ongoing and we estimate that there are between three and four assailants," he said. The U.N. official said those at the resort when the attack began included people affiliated with the French military mission as well as the U.N. The French president's office, the defense minister's office and the French military would not comment immediately on the attack or on media reports saying that French forces are intervening. The French Foreign Ministry would not say whether any French citizens were hurt or otherwise involved in the attack in the West African country. French military spokesman Col. Patrik Steiger said he had "strictly no information" about French military involvement in the incident in Bamako. He said there are no French troops based in Bamako, but about 2,000 French troops based in northern Mali fighting Islamic extremists. France intervened in Mali in 2013 to oust Islamic extremists who had seized control of the major northern towns the year before. While the militants were officially ousted, they have continued to launch regular attacks on U.N. peacekeeping and Malian military sites. Sunday's violence came about a week after the U.S. State Department warned of "possible future attacks on Western diplomatic missions, other locations in Bamako that Westerners frequent." Religious extremism in Mali once was limited to northern areas, although in recent years the jihadists have spread violence farther south, including a devastating attack on the Radisson Blu hotel in Bamako in November 2015. That attack left 20 dead - six Malians and 14 foreigners. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
US slaps new sanctions on Venezuela  [SEP]  CARACAS (AFP) - The United States imposed new sanctions on crisis-hit Venezuela on Wednesday (Aug 9), targeting members of a controversial super-powerful loyalist assembly installed last week to bolster what Washington calls the "dictatorship" of President Nicolas Maduro. The measures were aimed at six members of the so-called Constituent Assembly - among them the brother of late president Hugo Chavez - as well as a military officer in charge of security for the body, and a board member of the national electoral authority. They added to previous US sanctions on Maduro himself - a rare designation against a sitting head of state - imposed just before the assembly was elected on July 30 in a vote marred by violence, fraud allegations and an opposition boycott. "President Maduro swore in this illegitimate Constituent Assembly to further entrench his dictatorship, and continues to tighten his grip on the country," US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. "This regime's disregard for the will of the Venezuelan people is unacceptable, and the United States will stand with them in opposition to tyranny until Venezuela is restored to a peaceful and prosperous democracy." The announcement came as the Constituent Assembly and Venezuela's supreme court took actions to limit the opposition's ability to challenge Maduro. The assembly has established a "truth commission" which Maduro has said he wants to examine alleged crimes by opposition leaders - especially those in charge of the country's legislature, which his Socialist Party lost control of two years ago. The assembly also fired the attorney general, Luisa Ortega, who broke ranks to become an outspoken critic of the president. The supreme court ordered the jailing of an opposition mayor who allowed anti-government protests to happen in his Caracas district, and was mulling similar cases against others. Ostensibly brought in to rewrite the constitution, the Constituent Assembly has sweeping powers to override all other branches of government. It has vowed to remain in operation for up to two years - beyond the scheduled end of Maduro's term in 2019. Those targeted in the US sanctions announced Wednesday included Adan Coromoto Chavez, the brother of the late president who was Maduro's mentor before he died of cancer in 2013. The National Electoral Council board member, Tania D'Amelio Cardiet, was designated for defending the assembly and for suspicion of being involved in fraud in its election. The security official, Bladimir Humberto Lugo Armas, "has been involved in several acts of violence against National Assembly opposition members," including against the body's leader, Julio Borges, the US statement said. The sanctions freeze the US assets of those targeted and ban American entities from doing business with them. Major Latin American nations and Canada have also rejected the legitimacy of the Constituent Assembly and slammed Venezuela for "breaking democratic rule." The UN rights office has also condemned "excessive force" by Venezuelan security forces against protesters who objected to the Constituent Assembly and who are angry about an economic crisis that has made food and medicine scarce amid hyperinflation and a diving currency. Since the protests turned violent four months ago, nearly 130 people have died. Protests against Maduro have become muted in the past week however as authorities intensified a clampdown, though the opposition has urged demonstrators to continue. Although broadly criticised, Venezuela is not entirely isolated internationally. It can count on the support of Russia and China - which have granted tens of billions of dollars in loans to Venezuela. On Tuesday, Caracas hosted a number of leftist allies, including Cuba, Bolivia and Ecuador, as well small Caribbean nations to which it gives cheap oil, in a meeting to show solidarity. Maduro told the representatives he was open to regional dialogue - as long as Venezuela was "respected." T he leader reaffirmed that the difficulties he was facing were driven by an "imperialist" United States that wanted Venezuela's oil. "Venezuela is the big prize, the jewel of the crown - that's what they say in the corridors in Washington," he said. Venezuela's military, meanwhile, was hunting a small rebel group led by two renegade officers that raided an army base over the weekend and made off with weapons from its armoury. Maduro and Defence Minister General Vladimir Padrino described the attackers as "terrorists" with links to the US, insisting they were not part of any insurgency within the armed forces.
Philippines hands Imelda Marcos lengthy prison term in graft case  [SEP]  Imelda Marcos was found guilty of corruption on Friday and handed a lengthy prison term in a rare conviction for the former Philippine first lady accused with her late dictator husband of embezzling billions of dollars from state coffers. However, it was unlikely 89-year-old Marcos would spend much time behind bars as she is allowed to appeal the ruling and can remain free on bail as long as the conviction is not final. The verdict from the anti-graft Sandiganbayan court orders her to serve a minimum of six years behind bars for each of the seven charges that the Marcoses funnelled roughly $200 million through Swiss foundations decades ago. This leaves her potentially facing decades in prison, however the exact length of the term was not immediately clear. Ferdinand Marcos, who along with his cronies was accused of pilfering $10 billion from the Philippines, fled with his family to the US after a people's uprising ended his 20-year rule in 1986. Marcos died in 1989 while still in exile. But his heirs later returned to Manila and have since staged a political comeback. Imelda Marcos is currently a congresswoman. As a government official in the Marcos administration, Imelda was barred by law from having any financial interest from the Swiss foundations, said the ruling. "The couple opened all those accounts in Switzerland, and they used pseudonyms to hide their ownership. The president chose William Saunders and Imelda Marcos used Jane Ryan," special prosecutor Ryan Quilala told reporters. Her lawyers could not be reached, while a press aide told AFP there was no immediate comment. Marcos critics rejoiced at the news of the conviction, which came nearly three decades after the case was filed in 1991. "This points to how long and therefore frustrating the Philippine judicial system is," said opposition lawmaker Francis Pangilinan. "We hope our courts will see this through... and give no special treatment to Mrs. Marcos," he added. Court officials said Marcos, who was not at Friday's hearing, would be able to avoid incarceration by posting an as yet undetermined bail. She has the right to appeal her conviction to the Supreme Court. The court has previously undone at least one case against Imelda, overturning a 24 year jail sentence in 1993 on graft charges. She ran for congress and won while her appeal was underway. The family's notoriety stems back to Ferdinand Marcos declaring martial law in 1972. That allowed him to shutter the legislature, muzzle the free press and jail or kill those who dared to oppose his dictatorship. In the decades since Marcos's ouster the effort to recover the pilfered money has been halting and uneven. However, the Philippine Supreme Court in 2003 ordered $680 million in funds stashed by the Marcoses in Swiss banks handed to the government. The funds had earlier been turned over by the Swiss judiciary after concluding that the funds were stolen from the Manila government. The younger generation of Marcoses have led high-profile careers, despite the dark past associated with their name. Imelda and Ferdinand's daughter Imee Marcos is the governor of the family's northern stronghold of Ilocos Norte province and helped bankroll the 2016 election campaign of President Rodrigo Duterte, according to him. Imelda's son, also named Ferdinand, almost won the separate election for vice president that year. He has put the count under protest and hopes to run for president after Duterte's term ends in mid-2022.
Struggling to save nuclear deal, Iran and world powers meet  [SEP]  VIENNA, July 6 (Reuters) - Iran wants world powers to present measures guaranteeing oil revenue and investment into the country despite U.S. sanctions when ministers meet on Friday to save the 2015 nuclear deal, but European states will fall short of its demands, diplomats said. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the multinational deal in May under which sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for curbs on its nuclear programme, verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Washington has since told countries they must stop buying the OPEC producer's oil from Nov. 4 or face financial consequences. Foreign ministers from Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia meet with their Iranian counterpart in Vienna for the first time since Trump left the pact, but diplomats see limited scope for salvaging it. "The objective is to save the deal. We've made some progress, including on safeguarding some crude sales, but it's unlikely to meet Iranian expectations. It's also not just about what the Europeans can do, but also how the Chinese, Russians, Indians, others can contribute," said a senior European diplomat. The pillars of the European Union's strategy are: European Investment Bank lending, a special measure to shield EU companies from U.S. secondary sanctions and a Commission proposal that EU governments make direct money transfers to Iran's central bank to avoid U.S. penalties. "The Iranians expect the others to say what we are going to do to keep the deal alive. We will have to see if it is going to be good enough for them," an EU source added. Describing the Friday meeting as important, Iranian officials have said that key for them is to ensure measures that guarantee oil exports do not halt, and that Tehran still has access to the SWIFT international bank payments messaging system. During a visit to Europe this week President Hassan Rouhani warned that Iran could reduce its co-operation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog having already threatened Trump of the "consequences" of fresh sanctions against Iranian oil sales. Rouhani was quoted by state media and on his website after calls with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel as having told them he was disappointed with their package which did not go far enough. "SWIFT is the key but Iran has to stay in at least until the end of the year to maintain divisions between the EU and U.S., keep some credibility and try and survive amidst forthcoming sanctions," said Sanam Vakil, Associate Fellow at Chatham House, a London-based international think tank. While talks are expected to focus purely on the nuclear deal, they come amid increasing rhetoric from the Trump administration, which argues that Iran poses a serious security threat. An Austria-based Iranian diplomat was among four people arrested on suspicion of plotting an attack on an Iranian opposition group in France last week. The issue could be a distraction in the Vienna talks. Iran has said it had nothing to do with the plot and has demanded the official be released without delay. Any confirmation that Iranian authorities were behind the plot could make it politically difficult for European leaders to continue to back the nuclear deal.

Rohingya are not the first chapter in Myanmar's history of brutality  [SEP]  Even as India has come under criticism for its ungenerous treatment to Rohingya refugees, it is worth casting an eye on the perpetrator of the tragedy — the Myanmar Army. A series of attacks beginning October 2016 by a newly formed insurgent group Harakah al-Yaqin, also known as Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), led to a crackdown involving arbitrary arrests, extra-judicial killings and displacement of more than four lakh (400k) people. Myanmar's modern history has always been a violent one. The majority of 68 per cent or so are Bamar or Burmans. The most prominent minority groups are Shan, Karen, Chin, Rakhine, Kachin and Wa, who occupy significant portions of the country and have at various times fought the Burmese authorities. There are also the Tibetans, Gurkhas, Pakistanis, Indians and Rohingyas, most denied Myanmarese nationality, even though they have lived there for generations. A Rohingya insurgency has been around since the time of independence in 1948, but it has waxed and waned depending on the level of repression. Jihadi outfits in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh have fished in the troubled waters of Rakhine for quite some time but it's debatable whether they have achieved anything. Even the August 25 attack, which triggered the recent crackdown, saw the death of one soldier, one immigration officer and 10 policemen, against 59 insurgents killed. In response, the Army burnt entire villages, killed hundreds of Rohingyas and made more than four lakh refugees. What the world needs to focus on is their disproportionate violence, which is clearly a war crime. Actually, there is nothing unusual about the Burmese Army's actions. It has taken recourse to similar tactics in dealing with the Shan, Kachin, Karen or Wa insurgents, who have sought independence or greater autonomy. In 1988, the Army turned against the Burmese people as well, killing more than 3,000 people, who were protesting the military dictatorship. In 2006, operations against the Karen National Union led to hundreds of deaths and the displacement of hundreds of thousands because of a government relocation programme. In 2011, it was the turn of the Shan; in 2014, the Kachins; and in 2015, the Kokang region. Many of these conflicts continue in large measure because of the Myanmar Army's xenophobic attitude. Coming to the issue of refugees in India. In 2001, the Group of Ministers report on reforming the national security system also looked into border management and said that 'illegal migration from across our borders has continued unabated for more than five decades... today, we have about 15 million Bangladeshis, 2.2 million Nepalis, 70,000 Sri Lankan Tamils and about 1,00,000 Tibetan migrants living in India... This massive illegal migration poses a grave danger to our security, social harmony and economic well being.' Presumably, a majority of the Bangladeshis would be Muslims. Islamic terrorists coming from Bangladesh have mainly been operatives of the ISI or one or the other Pakistani jihadi groups. There is no reason to assume that the Rohingyas are the the vanguard of some new wave of Islamic terrorism. Fear mongering reports manufactured by shadowy government agencies had also once claimed that al- Qaeda was coming to India and later, the ISIS. As of now, neither have shown up. While the government is right to be cautious, its approach seems to be shaped by the ruling party's generally jaundiced world view when it comes to Muslims. The government's stand in the Supreme Court insisting on its right to deport Rohingya refugees is essentially driven by the politics of Jammu & Kashmir. Here, there is a tussle between the the Valley-based parties who are ready to provide facilities for refugees returning from PoK, while denying rights to Hindus and Sikhs who had come into the state in the wake of Partition. In an already inflamed debate, the presence of a large number of Rohingya who are, no doubt, illegally settled in the area, are seen as a threat to the ethnic balance of the Jammu region. While looking at the present crisis, it is worth casting an eye back in recent history, the 1960s, when General Ne Win expropriated the property of Indians who had been living in the country for generations. Some 3,00,000 Indians were forced to leave in conditions of extreme deprivation. Today, nearly a million Indians live in the country, but without any rights as citizens. As usual, India accommodated the refugees without any fuss. The need of the hour is a big heart, not a stingy mind.
Greek government spokesman says more than 20 people dead in two wildfires raging near Athens  [SEP]  Greek government spokesman says more than 20 people dead in two wildfires raging near Athens ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greek government spokesman says more than 20 people dead in two wildfires raging near Athens.
Security forces deploy in Iraq's Najaf after day of protests  [SEP]  Security forces deploy in Iraq's Najaf after day of protests BEIRUT (AP) — Iraqi security forces deployed on the streets of the Shiite holy city of Najaf on Saturday after a day of angry demonstrations over failing public services and high unemployment. Protesters chanting against politicians on Friday attacked the ruling Dawa party's office downtown and stormed the airport outside Najaf, forcing it to shut down. Calm returned to the city on Saturday, but security apparatuses remained on high alert after demonstrations spread across the country's predominantly-Shiite south. Rumors circulated on social media on Saturday that the government had shut down the internet in Baghdad, Najaf, and Basra, Iraq's premier oil city and the site of the first protests against joblessness and neglect. Communications links appeared severely limited in the three cities. Basra, despite producing most of Iraq's oil, is plagued by crumbling infrastructure and widespread poverty. The city suffers from rolling blackouts and water cuts that are felt acutely in the summer months, where temperatures regularly approach 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit). Police confronted protesters gathering near an oil field operated by the Russian company Lukoil, north of Basra, earlier this week, firing their weapons to disperse the crowds. Other parts of the south depend on agriculture for income, but Baghdad officials, citing water scarcity, issued a ban on planting summer crops, such as rice and corn, angering farmers last month. The demonstrations were given a boost Friday after a representative of the Shiite community's spiritual leader, the Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, offered his solidarity in a nationally televised sermon. "The dear governorate of Basra is the number one in providing the country with financial revenue. And it is the number one in the number of martyrs and those who have been wounded in the fight against the Islamic State group terrorists," said Sheikh Abdul Mahdi al-Karbalai. "So it is not fair, indeed it is not acceptable, that this governorate is one of Iraq's poorest." Caretaker Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi flew to Basra from a defense summit in Brussels on Friday to try to diffuse the unrest. He asked the Basra Oil Company to provide more jobs to locals. "We applaud each Basrawi who demands his rights," said al-Abadi in a press conference. At the same time, his office released statements condemning what it called vandalism by "infiltrators" among the demonstrations. Iraq held national elections in May, but government formation has been stalled by allegations of fraud and the failure of any coalition to secure an outright majority in the new Parliament. It could take weeks or longer for MPs to name a new Prime Minister as the country waits for officials to complete a partial recount. In Najaf, airport official Fuad al-Gharrawi said Iraq's second busiest airport was operational again. He blamed vandals for damage to the passenger terminal. Iraq is OPEC's third largest oil producer and home to some of the world's largest oil reserves.
Xi to be first Chinese leader to attend Davos World Economic Forum  [SEP]  BEIJING/GENEVA: President Xi Jinping this month will become the first Chinese head of state to attend the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, which this year will dwell on the rising public anger with globalization and the coming U.S. presidency of Donald Trump. Xi will take centre stage at the Jan. 17-20 forum with China presenting itself as a champion of globalization. The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Tuesday confirmed Xi's widely expected attendance at the annual gathering of global political leaders, CEOs and celebrities in the Swiss Alps. Davos will end just as Trump takes office, having won the White House in part with promises to pull the United States out of international trade deals and hike tariffs against China and Mexico in a protectionist campaign he says will help bring back industries and jobs to America. WEF executive chairman Klaus Schwab said he expected Xi to show how China would take a "responsive and responsible leadership role" in global affairs at a turning point in history, with the world needing new concepts to face the future. "Every simplified approach to deal with the complex global agenda is condemned to fail. We cannot have just populist solutions," Schwab told a news conference in Geneva, referring to the rising anti-globalization tide epitomized by Trump's victory and Britain's vote last year to exit the European Union. The Chinese president will be in Switzerland from Jan. 15-18 for a state visit and to attend the Davos meeting, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular press briefing. He will also visit the United Nations offices in Geneva, and the offices of the World Health Organization and the International Olympic Committee, Lu said. Other global leaders, including WEF regular German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, will not be in Davos this year. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was also absent from the line-up published on Tuesday, but there were many presidents, prime ministers and central bankers among the 3,000 participants, along with 1,800 executives from 1,000 companies. The United States will be represented by Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry, days before they leave office, and "someone from the transition team representing the new (Trump) administration", Schwab said. Xi led a forum of Asia-Pacific leaders in Peru in November in vowing to fight protectionism, just days after Trump won the U.S. election having pledged to pull out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal. Foreign businesses in China, however, have long complained about a lack of market access and protectionist Chinese policies. These include a Made in China 2025 plan that calls for a progressive increase in domestic components in sectors such as advanced information technology and robotics.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Busts Through 20,000, Looks Ahead  [SEP]  On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished above 20,000 for the first time. The barrier had been a psychological line of resistance since the post-election rally began. And it took just 42 days to make the climb of 1,000 points. It was the second fastest 1,000 points in history. According to The Wall Street Journal, the climb was second only to the Dow’s 1,000-point 24-day climb in the 1999’s dot-com boom. Both the Dow industrials and the S&P 500 rose 0.8%, and the Nasdaq gained 1%. All three major indices closed at record highs buoyed by expectations of pro-business policies under President Donald Trump. Boeing Co (NYSE: ) led the Dow 30, climbing 4.2% after it beat fourth-quarter earnings expectations. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: ) rose 2% and JP Morgan Chase & Co (NYSE: ) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ) gained 1.6% and 1.5% respectively. “Risk-On” strategies drove bonds lower, sending the 10-year Treasury’s yield to 2.5% from 2.4% on Tuesday. Gold fell 1.2% to $1,195.90 per ounce. Crude Oil (WTI) fell 0.8% to $52.75 per barrel. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 156 points to a new closing high at 20,069, the S&P 500 gained 18, closing at 2,298, the Nasdaq rose to 5,656 for a gain of 55 points and the Russell 2000 closed at 1,382, gaining 13 points. The NYSE’s primary exchange traded 880 million shares with total volume of 3.8 billion shares. The Nasdaq crossed 1.9 billion shares. On the Big Board, advancers outpaced decliners by 1.8-to-1, and on the Nasdaq, advancers led by 2.4-to-1. On the NYSE Blocks fell to 6,263 from 6,771 on Tuesday. There are many new projections for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Most aim at a further advance to the 20,220 area. The S&P 500, however, is not so visible. Assuming that the 500’s recent breakout was pushed by a “continuation gap,” my minimum target for it is 2,322 (close), or 2,370 (intraday). Conclusion: With a trailing 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 at over 24X and a forward 12-month P/E at over 17X, the consideration of new positions should be closely examined. Only those undervalued stocks, like our Trade of the Day, should be considered for trades. Recent run-ups that collect public attraction should be avoided since whipsaws from current levels could occur at any time. Another warning: The recent AAII bullish percent has risen to 44.7%, Neutral is at just 23% “the bottom of its typical range.” To see a list of the companies reporting earnings today, click here.

Sloane Stephens' title just the beginning of U.S. renaissance  [SEP]  Sloane Stephens shines in the US Open women's final, defeating fellow American Madison Keys in straight sets (6-3, 6-0) to win her first career major title. (0:47) NEW YORK -- Could there have been a better advertisement for the renaissance of US tennis than the extraordinary tableau US Open champion Sloane Stephens and runner-up Madison Key produced in the minutes following the match? Among other things, those heartwarming moments were an apt comment on where US tennis has recently been and -- better yet for US fans -- where it is going. No man or woman not named Williams had won a Grand Slam singles title in 14 years until Stephens beats Keys 6-3, 6-0 on Saturday evening. It's a tribute to how much the game has grown globally, and also to the lockdown imposed by Venus and Serena Williams. The most alarming aspects of the drought for the U.S. were becoming more concerning after Serena left the game early this year, and Venus turned 37 this summer. Venus, of course, made two major finals and the semis here, but the rains finally came in the form of Stephens, Keys and another US Open finalist, CoCo Vandeweghe. That's just the tip of iceberg. The really good news is that this trio never fully lived up to expectations -- until now -- to step up and represent the true face of the American game. Now that they have, it seems that visage is striking as a yellow happy-face emoji. The U.S. currently has a stockpile of potential impact players of either gender testing the waters of the pro tour. They've lacked only time -- and the validation. "Our pipeline is loaded," Martin Blackman, head of Player Development for the USTA, told ESPN.com. "And we attribute a lot of that to Venus and Serena. Maybe nobody else was breaking through during their time, but more importantly, they kept the bar calibrated to where it should be -- at the top of the game." Among younger players, generations overlap but span roughly two to four years thanks to the way junior tennis feeds the pro tours. That makes Vandeweghe, 26, Stephens, 24, and Keys, 22, the elder stateswomen of the U.S. game. Blackman believes all three are now well on their way to becoming top-five impact players. Right below that trio is another generation rapidly gaining experience on the pro tour in 18-and-under tour neophytes Kayla Day (ranked No. 128), Sofia Kennen (No. 139) and Claire Liu (No. 295). And let's not forget the highest-ranked 18-year-old in the WTA, No. 36 Catherine "CiCi" Bellis. • None Stephens takes down Keys to win US Open Sloane Stephens defeated Madison Keys 6-3, 6-0 to win the US Open. Stephens joins Kim Clijsters as the only unseeded US Open women's champions in the Open era, which dates to 1968. While the PA announcer in Arthur Ashe Stadium was introducing the women's finalists with great pomp and ceremony, two young Floridians were already grinding on nearby courts, hoping to meet each other in the girl's 18-and-under final. Cori Gauff, who has already announced in public that that she wants to be "the greatest of all time," was playing in one junior girls semifinal on Court 6, fittingly close to the media entrance to Ashe. Over in the Grandstand, 16-year-old Amanda Anisimova was pounding away in the other. They both won and will meet here Sunday for the championship. Gauff could be forgiven her brash remark; it had the ring of prophecy, not braggadocio. Gauff is just 13 years old, with so much talent you half expect it to overflow out of her sneakers. She's a preternaturally mature competitor as well. Seven women appear in the ITF's top 25 juniors. The situation on the men's side is different. There is no trio comparable to the three U.S. women who made the semis this week. Nor have the men done comparably well in this year's junior competition. But ... "It may look like the women are doing better than the men," Blackman said. "But women tend to break through to become real good between the ages of 17 and 19, while men often make their move between 19 and 21." Blackman also says that the U.S. has more 21-and-under men in the ATP top 300 than any other nation, as well as more 23-and-under men in the top 200. The big question, of course, is how many of those players will go on to become Grand Slam champions. "Grand Slam champions are outliers by definition, they're special," said Colette Lewis who run zootennis.com, a website that focuses on junior tennis. "But we Americans will certainly have contenders at majors. The group of boys two years ago [the generation of Frances Tiafoe and Taylor Fritz] is excellent, but the women have been three or four deep for a few years now." Robert Lansdorp, the coach who developed countless pros, including Tracy Austin, Lindsay Davenport, Pete Sampras and Maria Sharapova, says that young men have time to develop their full potential -- but not as much time as some might think. "I always thought you go on the tour three or four years, and that span gives you the basic area of where you're going to be for most of your career," Lansdorp told ESPN.com, citing the history of 20-year-old No. 6 Alexander Zverev. "After four years at No. 40, being No. 1 is just too big a reach. Usually, people who become No. 1 go up really fast; they don't stall or linger on the way." That's a cautionary note for any young player, but it isn't a law of nature. Outliers are just that, and as the three women semifinalists at this US Open showed, breakthroughs can happen at the most unexpected of times.
Hackers have a message for Iran: 'Don't mess with our elections'  [SEP]  Dubai : Hackers have attacked networks in a number of countries including data centres in Iran where they left the image of a US flag on screens along with a warning: "Don't mess with our elections". "The attack apparently affected 200,000 router switches across the world in a widespread attack, including 3500 switches in our country," Iran's Communication and Information Technology Ministry said in a statement on Saturday. The statement said the attack, which hit internet service providers and cut off web access for subscribers, was made possible by a vulnerability in routers from Cisco which had earlier issued a warning and provided a patch that some firms had failed to install over the Iranian new year holiday. A blog published on Thursday by Nick Biasini, a threat researcher at Cisco's Talos Security Intelligence and Research Group, said: "Several incidents in multiple countries, including some specifically targeting critical infrastructure, have involved the misuse of the Smart Install protocol ... "As a result, we are taking an active stance, and are urging customers, again, of the elevated risk and available remediation paths."
As Rohingya flee violence, Myanmar’s Suu Kyi skips U.N. General Assembly  [SEP]  BANGKOK — With Myanmar drawing condemnation for violence that has driven at least 370,000 Rohingya to flee the country, the government said Wednesday its leader Aung San Suu Kyi will skip this month’s U.N. General Assembly. Suu Kyi will miss the assembly, which opened Tuesday and runs through Sept. 25, in order to address domestic security issues, according to presidential office spokesman Zaw Htay. Suu Kyi is not Myanmar’s president — her official titles are state counselor and foreign minister — but she effectively serves as leader of the Southeast Asian nation. Zaw Htay said that, with President Htin Kyaw hospitalized, the second vice president would attend the U.N. meeting. “The first reason (Suu Kyi cannot attend) is because of the Rakhine terrorist attacks,” Zaw Htay said. “The state counselor is focusing to calm the situation in Rakhine state. There are circumstances. The second reason is, there are people inciting riots in some areas. We are trying to take care of the security issue in many other places. The third is that we are hearing that there will be terrorist attacks and we are trying to address this issue.” The crisis erupted on Aug. 25, when an insurgent Rohingya group attacked on police outposts in Myanmar’s Rakhine state. That prompted Myanmar’s military to launch “clearance operations” against the rebels, setting off a wave of violence that have left hundreds dead and thousands of homes burned — mostly Rohingya in both cases. The government blames Rohingya for the attacks, but journalists who visited the region found evidence that raises doubts about its claims that Rohingya set fire to their own homes. Many of the Rohingya who flooded into refugee camps in Bangladesh told of Myanmar soldiers shooting indiscriminately, burning their homes and warning them to leave or die. Others said they were attacked by Buddhist mobs. Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who lived under house arrest for many years under a military junta that ultimately gave way to an elected government, has faced a torrent of international criticism and pressure since the crisis erupted. On Tuesday, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the killing of Muslims a political disaster and called Suu Kyi a “brutal woman.” U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein said the Rohingya were victims of what “seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.” Bangladesh has been overwhelmed with the massive influx of Rohingya, many of whom arrived hungry and traumatized after walking for days through jungles or being packed into rickety wooden boats. Before Aug. 25, Bangladesh had already been housing some 500,000 Rohingya refugees who fled earlier flashes of violence including anti-Muslim riots in 2012. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has pledged to help the new arrivals, but demanded that Myanmar “take their nationals back.” With two pre-existing camps packed beyond capacity, the government said it would provide 2,000 acres (810 hectares) for a new camp in the border district of Cox’s Bazar. Many of the new arrivals were staying in schools, or were huddling under tarps in makeshift settlements along roads and in open fields. Dozens of foreign diplomats and aid agency officials were set to meet Rohingya refugees Wednesday near the Kutupalong refugee camp, according to Kazi Abdur Rahman, additional deputy commissioner in Cox’s Bazar district. “A humanitarian crisis is going on here,” he said. The diplomats “will visit camps, talk to them, see their condition. We need to work together during such a serious crisis.” Two human rights groups have accused the U.N. Security Council of ignoring the crisis. “This is an international peace and security crisis” and there is no excuse for the Security Council “sitting on its hands,” Louis Charbonneau of Human Rights Watch said Tuesday alongside representatives from Amnesty International at the U.N. headquarters The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, the world’s largest Muslim body, urged Myanmar to allow in U.N. monitors so they can investigate what it alleged was systematic brutality against the Rohingya. The U.N. Human Rights Council approved an investigative mission earlier this year, but Myanmar in June refused to allow it to enter. An envoy’s visit in July was met with protests. The ethnic Rohingya Muslim minority has faced decades of discrimination persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where they are denied citizenship despite centuries-old roots in the country. On Tuesday, the president’s office said Myanmar’s government had established a new committee to address security and economic development in Rohingya areas. It said the 15-member committee would work on implementing recommendations made last month by a commission led by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

Gianforte requests Monday court appearance  [SEP]  (AP) - The Latest on an assault charge against U.S. Rep.-elect Greg Gianforte of Montana (all times local): 12:50 p.m. U.S. Rep.-elect Greg Gianforte of Montana is requesting a Monday court appearance on a misdemeanor assault charge against a reporter. Thursday's court filing by the Republican's attorneys asks that Gianforte be arraigned and sentenced at the same hearing. Gallatin County Attorney Marty Lambert says he expects the case to be wrapped up then. On Wednesday, Gianforte and Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs reached a civil settlement that included Jacobs agreeing not to object to Gianforte pleading no contest to the criminal charge. A no contest charge allows Gianforte to concede to the charge without entering a guilty plea. The maximum penalty for misdemeanor assault is six months in prison and a $500 fine. Gianforte is accused of attacking Jacobs the day before Montana's special congressional election when the reporter asked him a question. ___ 8:50 p.m. Wednesday U.S. Rep.-elect Greg Gianforte of Montana says in an apology letter that he "had no right to assault" a reporter. Gianforte's letter to reporter Ben Jacobs of The Guardian dated Wednesday is part of a settlement with Jacobs in which the reporter agrees not to object to Gianforte entering a plea of "no contest" to a misdemeanor assault charge. The Republican will contribute $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists as part of the settlement agreement. Jacobs says he hopes the episode will reinforce respect for freedom of the press and encourage more civil discourse. Jacobs previously said he was "body slammed" by Gianforte on the day before the May 25 special congressional election in Montana when the reporter tried to ask him a question. Gianforte won the election and was charged with misdemeanor assault.
China releases Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo with terminal cancer: Lawyer  [SEP]  BEIJING: China 's jailed Nobel peace prize laureate Liu Xiaobo was granted medical parole after being diagnosed with terminal liver cancer last month, his lawyer told AFP on Monday."He's now being treated at a hospital in Shenyang (in northeast Liaoning province). He has no special plans. He is just receiving medical treatment for his illness," lawyer Mo Shaoping said, adding that he was diagnosed on May 23 and released days later.
DNA shows first modern Briton had dark skin, blue eyes  [SEP]  The first modern Briton had dark skin and blue eyes, London scientists said on Wednesday, following groundbreaking DNA analysis of the remains of a man who lived 10,000 years ago. Known as "Cheddar Man" after the area in southwest England where his skeleton was discovered in a cave in 1903, the ancient man has been brought to life through the first ever full DNA analysis of his remains. In a joint project between Britain's Natural History Museum and University College London, scientists drilled a 2mm hole into the skull and extracted bone powder for analysis. Their findings transformed the way they had previously seen Cheddar Man, who had been portrayed as having brown eyes and light skin in an earlier model. "It is very surprising that a Brit 10,000 years ago could have that combination of very blue eyes but really dark skin," said the museum's Chris Stringer, who for the past decade has analysed the bones of people found in the cave. The findings suggest that lighter pigmentation being a feature of populations of northern Europe is more recent than previously thought. Cheddar Man's tribe migrated to Britain at the end of the last Ice Age and his DNA has been linked to individuals discovered in modern-day Spain, Hungary and Luxembourg. Selina Brace, a researcher of ancient DNA at the museum, said the cave environment Cheddar Man was found in helped preserve his remains. "In the cave you have a really nice, cool, dry, constant environment, and that basically prevents the DNA from breaking down," she said. A bust of Cheddar Man, complete with shoulder-length dark hair and short facial hair, was created using 3D printing. It took close to three months to build the model, with its makers using a high-tech scanner which had been designed for the International Space Station. Alfons Kennis, who made the bust with his brother Adrie, said the DNA findings were "revolutionary". "It's a story all about migrations throughout history," he told Channel 4 in a documentary to be aired on February 18. "It maybe gets rid of the idea that you have to look a certain way to be from somewhere. We are all immigrants," he added.
Assange situation 'not sustainable', says Ecuador government  [SEP]  Julian Assange's situation is "not sustainable", according to the foreign minister of Ecuador, the country sheltering him. Assange has been holed up in the tiny Ecuadorian embassy in London's Knightsbridge since 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over sexual assault charges, which he has denied. The investigation into the WikiLeaks founder was dropped last year. But he remains in self-imposed exile due to fears he could still be arrested by UK police for breaching bail conditions. He claims such an arrest could be followed by extradition to the United States to face espionage charges. Now Ecuador may seek a third party to mediate with British lawmakers, foreign minister María Fernanda Espinosa told Associated Press. If the situation is indeed untenable, Assange could finally leave the embassy. Asked for a comment, WikiLeaks reiterated that Assange's "detention in the UK is unlawful", and called for him to receive compensation. The Ecuadorian embassy have yet to respond to a request for comment.
US Intelligence Chief James Clapper Resigns  [SEP]  The United States’ intelligence chief James Clapper has resigned ahead of Donald Trump’s inauguration. He told a hearing of the House intelligence committee on Thursday that he had submitted his resignation on Wednesday night and felt “pretty good” about it. “I submitted my letter of resignation last night which felt pretty good. I’ve got 64 days left,” he said His resignation, which comes as Mr Trump is carrying out his transitional meetings, is one of the first from president Obama’s administration. Clapper assumed office in August 2010, becoming the 4th Director of National Intelligence (DNI) During his time as director he has often been required to defend the position of the National Security Agency (NSA). The agency’s image was badly damaged after whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed how its programs spied on American citizens.
UN, Myanmar agree on first steps toward return of Rohingya  [SEP]  YANGON, Myanmar (AP) — Myanmar and the United Nations agreed to take steps to create conditions for the safe return of about 700,000 Rohingya Muslims who have fled military-led violence into Bangladesh. The agreement announced by the government and two U.N. agencies on Thursday calls for a framework of cooperation that will lead to the "voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable" repatriation of Rohingya refugees "to their places of origin or of their choosing." The U.N. refugee agency said that the conditions for voluntary return are not conducive yet. The memorandum of understanding — which is expected to be signed next week — "is the first and necessary step to support the government's efforts to change that situation and is also intended to support recovery and resilience-based development for the benefit of all communities living in Rakhine state," UNHCR said in a statement. Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed in November to begin repatriating the Rohingya, but the refugees expressed concern that they would be forced to return and would face unsafe conditions in Myanmar if the process is not monitored by international aid groups. The government said in a statement that it initialed the agreement with the U.N. Development Program and UNHCR for their assistance so that verified displaced people "can return voluntarily in safety and dignity." The U.N. said the agreement also provides for the two agencies to be given access to western Rakhine state, where most of the violence against the Rohingya has occurred since August. It said that will allow the refugee agency to assess the situation, carry out protection activities, and provide information to refugees about conditions in their home areas so that they can better decide whether they want to return. Myanmar's security forces have been accused of rape, killing, torture and the burning of Rohingya homes. The United Nations and the United States have described the army crackdown as "ethnic cleansing." The government has denied the accusations, instead blaming the violence on Rohingya insurgents who attacked security posts that triggered the reprisals and the latest exodus of the population that has long been denied citizenship and other basic rights. The government of predominantly-Buddhist Myanmar says Rohingya are illegal migrants from Bangladesh, even though some have lived in the country for generations. Myanmar has said so far it will only allow refugees with identity documents — which most Rohingya lack — to return. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

2016 to get little bit longer with leap second  [SEP]  For some folks, 2016 is the year that wouldn't end, and it's actually going to get longer.Timekeepers are adding an extra second Saturday at midnight - a leap second - so you might want to count down from 11 on New Year's Eve to be precise.The scientists who keep track of international time say it's necessary to add the second to keep the world's atomic clocks in sync with the Earth's own rotation, which fluctuates unpredictably and is less stable than our technology.There have been 26 leap seconds added to the clock since 1972.
Death Toll In Tehran Attack Rises; Iranian Official Calls U.S. Response 'Repugnant'  [SEP]  A day after the twin terrorist attacks in Tehran, Iranian state media said the death toll has risen to 17 and Iran's foreign minister denounced the official White House response as "repugnant." Iran's Intelligence Ministry also identified five extremists who attacked the Parliament and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Wednesday and confirmed that they had fought for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. Two teams of attackers armed with guns and explosives targeted the Parliament building and the mausoleum in apparently coordinated attacks that occurred within an hour of each other. Five of the attackers died and, Reuters reports, more than half a dozen suspects have been arrested in connection with the assault — the first major attack Iran has experienced in years. Iran initially said a dozen victims died; it's unclear whether the toll announced Thursday includes the five attackers. Dozens of people were wounded. Meanwhile, President Trump's statement on the attack has prompted criticism in Iran. The statement from the White House read in full: That second sentence, suggesting Iran bears responsibility for an attack against its civilians, was not well-received, NPR's Peter Kenyon reports. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad-Zarif called it "repugnant" on Twitter and said the Iranian people "reject" the statement. Other parts of Trump's administration have been striving to moderate that message. NPR's Michele Kelemen notes that the State Department condemned the attack and wrote that "the depravity of terrorism has no place in a peaceful, civilized world." The United States and several allies in the Middle East have been fighting against the Islamic State. Iran also has been fiercely opposed to the militant group. Iran is a majority-Shiite nation, and the Islamic State is a Sunni group that often targets Shiite Muslims. Iran has indirectly suggested that Saudi Arabia, its major regional rival and a U.S. ally, played a role in the attack. Iran's Revolutionary Guards have suggested that the attack was linked to Saudi Arabia. They never named the country directly, but the implication was clear. Their statement, according to a Financial Times translation and annotation, read: "This terrorist act took place a week after a joint meeting between the US president and head of a reactionary regional country [Saudi Arabia] which has been a constant supporter of terrorism. ... The fact ISIS claimed responsibility proves that they [Saudi Arabia] were involved in the brutal attack." Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi told IRNA on Thursday that it is clear Saudi Arabia supports terrorist groups but it is too soon to say whether it was involved in the Parliament and mausoleum strikes.
The Latest: Tribune says newspapers hit by computer virus  [SEP]  The Latest: Tribune says newspapers hit by computer virus LOS ANGELES (AP) — The Latest on a computer virus that has affected the printing and delivery of newspapers across the nation (all times local): Tribune Publishing says a computer virus disrupted production of the Chicago Tribune and its other newspapers across the country, the Chicago Tribune reports . The company says the print edition of the Chicago Tribune was published Saturday without paid death notices and classified ads, while in other markets a similarly slimmed-down version of the Saturday newspaper will be delivered on Sunday. Tribune Publishing spokeswoman Marisa Kollias says in a statement: "This issue has affected the timeliness and in some cases the completeness of our printed newspapers. Our websites and mobile applications however, have not been impacted." The Chicago Tribune says that Tribune Publishing also reported the attack to the FBI on Friday. A computer virus hit newspaper printing plant in Los Angeles, preventing it from printing and delivering Saturday editions of the Los Angeles Times, the San Diego Union-Tribune and other papers to some subscribers. The Los Angeles Times, which runs the facility, says the computer virus infected systems that are associated with the printing process. Spokeswoman Hillary Manning says the paper has been working to fix the issues but added that Sunday deliveries may be affected as well. Biotech billionaire Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong bought both the Los Angeles Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune earlier this year for $500 million.

President Trump's choice for VA Secretary withdraws his nomination  [SEP]  Facing numerous questions about his past work record, White House physician Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson withdrew from consideration for VA Secretary on Thursday morning, calling a variety of claims about him, ‘false and fabricated.’ “If they had any merit, I would not have been selected,” Jackson said in a written statement. “I am regretfully withdrawing my nomination,” Jackson said in a written statement. “Unfortunately, because of how Washington works, these false allegations have become a distraction for this President and the important issue we must be addressing – how we give the best care to our nation's heroes,” Jackson added. Jackson’s nomination had been in peril all week, as allegations piled up against him, and his confirmation hearing on Wednesday had been postponed indefinitely. The move came after President Trump had openly suggested earlier in the week that Jackson did not have to pursue the post. “I even told him a day or two ago – I saw where this was going,” the President said in a telephone interview on “Fox and Friends.” Even before questions were raised about incidents during his time as the White House physician, there were GOP Senators who were not pleased about the President’s choice for VA Secretary, wondering aloud about vetting procedures at the White House for top nominees. “I don’t know whether that process is being short circuited now,” said Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) earlier this week. Lawmakers in both parties quickly said the President needed to find a VA nominee who was familiar with the troubles confronting the massive federal agency. “The next VA Secretary must have the experience and commitment needed to continue that progress,” said Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN). “We owe it to those who have served our country.” As for Jackson, he was at the White House on Thursday, at his regular job as the President’s physician. “Admiral Jackson is a doctor in the United States Navy assigned to the White House and is here at work today,” said White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Iraqi forces close in on Mosul mosque as residents flee  [SEP]  MOSUL, Iraq, March 19 (Reuters) - Iraqi army helicopters strafed and fired rockets at Islamic State positions in Mosul's Old City on Sunday as troops on the ground closed in on the strategic and symbolic prize of the al-Nuri Mosque. Federal Police troops had advanced past the train station in western Mosul closer to the mosque. A police commander said they were very close to taking control of it. Residents fled from the area, carrying bags of belongings and picking their way through the wrecked buildings as shells and gunfire echoed behind them. Most of them were women and children. "Federal Police and Rapid Response forces resumed their advance after halting operations due to bad weather. The troops have a target of retaking the rest of the Old City," a police spokesman said. The battle to recapture Islamic State's last stronghold in Iraq has now entered its sixth month. Iraqi government forces, backed by U.S. advisers, artillery and air support, have cleared the east and half of western Mosul and are now focused on controlling the Old City. Recent fighting has targeted the centuries-old al-Nuri Mosque, with its famous leaning minaret. Its capture would be a blow for Islamic State as it was from there that IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a caliphate in July 2014 after the hardline militants had seized swathes of Iraq and Syria. U.S. officials estimate about 2,000 IS fighters remain inside Iraq's second largest city, resisting with mortar fire, snipers and suicide car bombs that plough into army positions. The black Islamic State flag still flew from the mosque's minaret on Sunday. Federal Police moved in on foot from near the train station towards the Old City, trotting through rubble-filled streets. Police commander General Khalid al-Obedi told reporters on the frontline: "We are advancing toward the Old City. Their resistance is weakening. They are mostly using car bombs and that shows they are losing on the ground." He barked orders into his radio as mortar rounds landed beyond his position. Reporters saw an air strike hit Islamic State positions about 300 meters (yards) ahead on the frontline. Helicopters circling overhead fired rockets and raked the ground with machinegun fire. Federal police also arrested Husam Sheet al-Jabouri, the local chief of Diwan al-Hisba, an IS unit responsible for enforcing strict Islamic rules, in Mosul's Bab al-Sijin area, a police statement said. As fighting has entered into the narrow alleyways and densely populated parts of west Mosul, more residents are fleeing liberated areas where food and water are scarce and homes are often caught in shelling. Families with elderly relatives and children marched through western Mosul's muddy streets, past buildings pock-marked by bullet and bombs on Saturday. Some said they had hardly eaten in weeks, scrambling for supplies handed out by a local aid agency. "It is terrible, Islamic State have destroyed us. There is no food, no bread. There is absolutely nothing," said one resident. As many as 600,000 civilians may be caught inside the city with the militants. About 255,000 people have been displaced from Mosul and surrounding areas since October, including more than 100,000 since the military campaign in western Mosul began on Feb. 19, according to United Nations figures. The last week has seen the highest level of displacement yet, with 32,000 displaced between March 12 and 15.

Kenosha Sheriff's office: Officials working on flood effects  [SEP]  KENOSHA, Wis. (AP) -- The Kenosha County Sheriff's Department says emergency management officials are continuing to respond to the effects of last week's flooding. The department said Sunday that the American Red Cross has opened a shelter at the Salem Grade School. The Red Cross is offering resources including counselors. The county health department has clean up and home well test kits available. Some roadways remain closed. The sheriff's department says it has responded to more than 1,200 calls for service between July 10 and noon on Sunday.
Iran’s rial crashes to fresh record low as US sanctions loom  [SEP]  Tehran — Iran’s currency traded at a fresh record-low of 119,000 to the dollar on Tuesday, a loss of nearly two-thirds of its value since the start of the year as US sanctions loom. The Iranian rial has been crashing in recent days as the country anxiously awaits the reimposition of full US sanctions, starting on August 6. The rial hit 100,000 to the dollar for the first time on Sunday and continued its decline on Monday, losing 18% of its value in less than two days. On January 1, the dollar was worth 42,900 rials. The government has been in crisis mode, replacing its central bank chief last week. The central bank issued a statement on Monday, blaming the currency volatility on the "enemies’ conspiracy" and vowing fresh counter-measures "in the coming days". In April, the government tried to fix the value of the rial at 42,000, but black-market rates exploded as Iranians rushed to illegal traders, seeking to protect their savings by buying dollars, or investing in the hope that the rial would continue to fall. With banks often refusing to sell their dollars at the artificially low rate, the government was forced to soften its line in June, allowing more flexibility for certain groups of importers. Having announced in May that it was pulling out of the 2015 nuclear deal, the US is set to reimpose its full range of sanctions in two stages, on August 6 and November 4.
Azerbaijani wrestlers claim two bronze medals at Takhti Cup tournament  [SEP]  Baku. 16 January. REPORT.AZ/ Azerbaijani wrestlers have won two bronze medals at the Takhti Cup tournament in Tehran. Report informs, the medals came from Sakit Guliyev and Mirjalal Hasanzadeh.
Senate reveals Nigerian govt paid ransom for release of Chibok girls  [SEP]  The Senate has hinted that the Nigerian government paid ransom to secure the release of some of the Chibok girls kidnapped in April 2014 by Boko Haram terrorists. This was revealed on Thursday, while the lawmakers were deliberating on a motion seeking the intervention of the federal government on the rescue of the 46 girls, who were reported missing from their school in Dapchi, Yobe state after insurgents invaded their school. The Federal Government had confirmed that negotiations took place in the release of some of the 276 captured Chibok girls, but kept mum on the issue of possible payment of ransom. Over 100 of the Chibok girls have been released while scores more are still being held by the terrorists. Senate Leader, Ahmed Lawan, stated that Boko Haram now “use them as target to get funds”. “What happened was unfortunate and after the Chibok incident, it was the wish of every Nigerian that it doesn’t happen again in the country. I want to, at this point, commend Mr. President, Muhammadu Buhari, for immediately taking action by directing the armed forces to move into Yobe to ensure that Boko Haram did not run away with any single girl. “I want to also commend the Governor of Yobe State, Ibrahim Geidam, for ensuring that parents were comforted, for sending officials of the ministry of education to go round the families and ensure that they took head count of the girls from that school. “What happened is a lesson for us. That Boko Haram sees girls or women as value targets. What they did in Chibok earned them some funds, because negotiations were held somehow and they got a lot of money. “Now, the lesson is, we need to be extra careful and take extraordinary measures in protecting our schools; especially girls’ schools in those states especially Borno, Yobe and Adamawa.”
More CEOs condemn immigration ban as Trump fires acting attorney general  [SEP]  January 31, 2017 by Julie Pace, Eric Tucker and Joseph Pisani, The Associated Press WASHINGTON—In an extraordinary public showdown, President Donald Trump fired the acting attorney general of the United States Jan. 30 after she publicly questioned the constitutionality of his refugee and immigration ban and refused to defend it in court. The clash Monday night between Trump and Sally Yates, a career prosecutor and Democratic appointee, laid bare the growing discord and dissent surrounding an executive order that halted the entire U.S. refugee program and banned all entries from seven Muslim-majority nations for 90 days. The firing, in a written statement released just hours after Yates went public with her concerns, also served as a warning to other administration officials that Trump is prepared to terminate those who refuse to carry out his orders. Yates’ refusal to defend the executive order was largely symbolic given that Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump’s pick for attorney general, will almost certainly defend the policy once he’s sworn in. He’s expected to be confirmed Jan. 31 by the Senate Judiciary Committee and could be approved within days by the full Senate. Yet the firing reflected the mounting conflict over the executive order, as administration officials have moved to distance themselves from the policy and even some of Trump’s top advisers have made clear that they were not consulted on its implementation. As protests erupted at airports across the globe, and as legal challenges piled up in courthouses, Yates directed agency attorneys not to defend the executive order. She said in a memo Monday she was not convinced it was lawful or consistent with the agency’s obligation “to stand for what is right.” Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, soon followed with a statement accusing Yates of having “betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States.” Trump named longtime federal prosecutor Dana Boente, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, as Yates’ replacement. Boente was sworn in privately late Monday, the White House said, and rescinded Yates’s directive. Meanwhile, the heads of some of the world’s biggest companies are fighting back against President Donald Trump’s temporary immigration ban, calling it un-American and bad for business. The CEOs of Ford and Goldman Sachs are two of the latest high-profile executives to say they don’t support the executive order the president signed last week. A host of other big businesses, including Apple, Google and a number of other large tech firms came out against the ban over the weekend. Other companies said they will help employees affected by the ban or, in the case of Starbucks, hire refugees. Businesses already have a complicated relationship with Trump, who has been openly critical of companies planning to build plants in Mexico or charge what he sees as too much for fighter jets. Some have announced hiring plans and investments in the U.S., saying they like Trump’s plans to reduce regulation and lower corporate taxes. But the corporate reaction to the executive order was strong, quick and harsh. “This is unprecedented,” said Bill Klepper, an adjunct management professor at Columbia Business School in New York. Trump said the executive order, signed Friday, was necessary to stop “radical Islamic terrorists” from coming to the U.S. It included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, or Yemen, and a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program. The White House did not respond to a request for comment Monday. It could be risky for businesses to speak out publicly, since Trump likes to fight back and criticize companies from his Twitter account. But public-relations experts said businesses have no choice, especially if the ban negatively affects their employees or customers. “No company has gone out of business putting their customers and employees first,” said Matt Friedman, co-founder of Tanner Friedman Strategic Communications in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Following the tech firm push-back over the weekend, Coca-Cola Co. CEO Muhtar Kent said the soda maker was against the travel ban, and General Electric Co. CEO Jeff Immelt said the industrial conglomerate would make its “voice heard” with the new administration and Congress. Ford Motor Co. said it does not support the policy “or any other that goes against our values as a company,” according to a letter signed by the automaker’s CEO Mark Fields and Executive Chairman Bill Ford. General Motors Co. sent a note to employees saying it will support any who can’t return to the U.S. because of the ban. But other automakers, Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co., were silent. The auto industry, a frequent target of Trump’s ire for moving jobs overseas, is walking a fine line, trying to avoid punishing tariffs and hoping Trump gives them some relief on corporate taxes and fuel economy standards. And Goldman Sachs Group Inc., whose former employees are some of Trump’s most trusted advisers, also pushed back. “This is not a policy we support,” said the bank’s CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, in a voicemail to employees. Drugmaker Merck & Co. said it will offer legal advice and other assistance to its employees, as did furniture seller Ikea. But taking a position on political matters can be risky for companies. The hashtag #BoycottStarbucks was trending on Twitter Monday after the company announced it will hire 10,000 refugees over the next five years at its coffee shops around the world. Starbucks Corp. said that it recognizes “that sometimes there are those who may disagree with us, and we respect these diverse points of view and will continue to listen.” —AP reporters Matthew Lee, Lolita C.

In Calais' refugee slum, teenagers dream of Britain  [SEP]  CALAIS, France (AP) — Inside the Kids Cafe, a ramshackle refuge in a sprawling migrant slum in Calais, a mobile phone rings. Afghan teenager Wasaal takes the call. A friend of his has managed to hide inside a truck and hopes he will soon be on the other side of the English Channel. “The problem is that he does not have GPS on his mobile. He does not know if the truck is moving in the right direction,” the 14-year-old said. In fact, few in this muddy, violent camp in the northern French city know where they are going, but dreams abound of a life in Britain, just 21 miles (33 kilometers) across the sea. The French government has announced plans to shut down the camp that has become a demoralizing symbol of Europe’s migrant crisis by the end of the year. That means 6,000 to 10,000 migrants will need to be relocated, including up to 1,300 minors, according to different estimates from charities operating in the camp. Many refugee children in Calais claim to have family ties in the U.K. and don’t even consider building their future in France. Jonny Willis, a volunteer from the French refugee and youth service, says the camp’s appalling living conditions and poor hygiene have been a strong deterrent. “They went through a terrible experience here,” said Willis. “They have been treated so badly by police. This camp lacks basic services, in addition there is no security.” Wasaal himself has stopped trying to sneak onto trucks to Britain. Instead he’s had his fingerprints taken as part of his request for asylum. “I tried it more than 10 times over the past seven months,” he said. “But I’m not doing it anymore. I’m in the process of being reunited with my uncle and cousins. I don’t how long it will take, it’s for the Home Office to decide.” Britain’s Home Office says small groups of refugee children have been coming in a weekly basis for the last few months and hundreds are now expected to cross the Channel legally before the Calais camp is destroyed. Inside the Kids Cafe, a place where teenagers can relax and enjoy a free meal, Wasaal and a dozen of other boys are listening to music while playing pool. The sofas are worn out, but a poster of a red British double-decker bus reminds everyone that London is just a few miles away. After a perilous three-month journey across countries including Syria, Turkey, and Serbia, Wasaal can’t wait for his British dream to come true. “Here I’m just wasting my time,” the teenager said in fluent English. “We are too busy dealing with daily life problems. We can’t think properly.” “I left because my family was in danger,” said the boy, who fled Kunduz province in northern Afghanistan where Taliban are conducting repeated raids. Wasaal has lost touch with his parents, who also fled the violence. His hopes are simple: receiving a proper education in a safe environment. “I just dream to be in a place where there will be no one to harm me. Back in Afghanistan, I had very good results in two different subjects, physics and mathematics. I want to be an engineer,” he said. Aid groups agree the Calais slum must be shut down, but are urging authorities to take their time. The refugee youth service has handed mobile phones to hundreds of children and collected information to make sure they won’t go missing when the camp is dismantled. When the southern part of the camp was destroyed in April, 129 children vanished. “We should do everything to ensure that minors don’t disappear,” Genevieve Avenard, the French government’s children rights watchdog, said during a recent visit. “They are in danger of being exploited. We also need time to give these children their confidence back, so they can set up a project for their future life.” Mahmud, 16, already knows what he wants to be — a business accountant. The Afghan teenager, whose parents were killed when he was a boy, hopes he will be transferred to Birmingham, where his uncle has already been in touch with British authorities. In the meantime, he’s bored of wandering around the camp without a plan. At night, he sleeps in Container No. 51, one of the heated white containers holding up to 1,500 people. Mahmud is also wary of the frequent violence in the camp. “There are too many fighting here. I really don’t like that,” said the diminutive boy, wearing only a pair of flip flops on a cold afternoon. Tensions have been growing amid the looming uncertainty. It’s only a matter of weeks before all the Calais migrants will be deported, transferred to England or relocated to more than 160 centers around France. One British charity has warned of possible suicide attempts from desperate migrants. But new migrants are still arriving. On Thursday at the Calais-Frethun train station, a young boy in jeans and sneakers stepped out of the express train from Paris. He was immediately arrested by two French police officers. “We checked his ID, he’s a 17-year-old from Somalia,” one police officer said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity. “He wants to go to England. Every day, it’s the same story. They keep on coming.”
Australian ruling party set to choose new prime minister  [SEP]  Australia appears set to get its sixth change of prime minister in 11 years on Friday in a ballot of government lawmakers which would continue an era of extraordinary political instability. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is among the favorites and would be Australia's second female prime minister. Other favorites include Treasurer Scott Morrison and the only declared challenger Peter Dutton, a former Cabinet minister. Beleaguered Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull demanded the names of lawmakers in the conservative Liberal Party who wanted him to go before he would allow them to choose a new prime minister at a meeting at Parliament House on Friday. The names would provide proof that a majority of his government had abandoned him. Turnbull would then become the fourth prime minister to be dumped by his or her own party before serving a full three-year term since the revolving door to the prime minister's office started in 2010. The trend is universally hated by Australians. "Australians will be rightly appalled by what they're witnessing," Turnbull said on Thursday in announcing the meeting that would end his career. Public anger became apparent overnight with windows broken at the Brisbane office of Dutton, Turnbull's main rival in his government. Dutton has told the prime minister that a majority of Liberal Party lawmakers — at least 43 — don't support his leadership. But Dutton's supporters on Thursday could not find 43 lawmakers prepared to sign their names to a petition demanding a leadership ballot. An explanation could be that some lawmakers fear they will be punished by voters if they put their names to dumping Turnbull. The ballot to choose a prime minister is secret, so lawmakers don't have to declare which candidate they voted for. Many later lie that they backed the winner. Support for ousting Turnbull might also have waned because he warned Thursday he would quit politics rather than ask his party again for its support in a ballot. His resignation from Parliament would force a by-election that could cost the government its single-seat majority. The resignation could also push his successor into immediately calling general elections. Mathias Cormann, a former Turnbull supporter who switched his allegiance to Dutton, said he was confident that the meeting would go ahead of Friday. He declined to say how many signatures had been collected. The party's federal executive had intervened, telling a defiant Turnbull but that the state branches unanimously wanted the leadership crisis resolved on Friday, lawmaker Eric Abetz said. Some lawmakers who were against the change of prime minister said they had agreed to sign the petition in a bid to end the impasse. "I am being pressured — beyond any comprehension — I am being pressured to put my name on that list so it can bring the party room to a meeting," staunch Turnbull supporter Scott Buchholz said on Friday. Turnbull had defeated Dutton 48-35 in a surprise vote on Tuesday. Turnbull initiated the ballot in the hope of ending speculation that his government had lost faith in him in the face of poor opinion polling. Several ministers have since resigned and told him that most of the government wanted a new leader. Opposition Labor Party leader Bill Shorten told Parliament on Thursday it was evidence that "Australia no longer has a functioning government." "The Liberal Party, whatever it does today and tomorrow, is irreparably split," Shorten said.
Death toll rises to 15 after typhoon lashes China, Taiwan | Metro News  [SEP]  BEIJING — A powerful typhoon has caused at least 15 deaths in China and Taiwan just days before a second storm is expected to batter the region. Chinese authorities say 13 people have died in the eastern provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang since Typhoon Meranti made landfall early Thursday, with another 14 people still missing. Taiwanese officials have reported two dead. A second typhoon, Malakas, is expected to hit Taiwan on Saturday before moving on to China. Meranti this week lashed a vast swath of China's seaboard, including Shanghai, with heavy rain and winds of up to 280 per hour (175 miles per hour). The typhoon made landfall in China's southeastern Fujian province, where media reports showed power lines toppled and streets submerged in water. Repair workers were working as of late Friday to restore electricity to millions of residents in the Fujian provincial capital of Xiamen, according to state media. Meanwhile, officials in the Taiwanese capital Taipei have closed offices and schools on Saturday in anticipation of rough weather from Malakas. The second storm, although less powerful than Meranti, is still expected to lash Taiwan's capital with gusts of up to 191 per hour (118 miles per hour) before veering north.
Kenyan Runner Eliud Kipchog Breaks World Marathon Record In Berlin  [SEP]  Two hours, one minute and 39 seconds. That's what it took Kenyan runner Eliud Kipchoge to break the world marathon record last weekend in Berlin.
Brazil senators inch toward Rousseff impeachment vote  [SEP]  BRASÌLIA: Brazilian senators waged an emotional marathon debate on the eve of voting on whether to strip Dilma Rousseff of the presidency and end 13 years of leftist rule in Latin America’s biggest country. Lawyers on both sides of the impeachment trial dividing Brazil made impassioned closing arguments, followed by final speeches from senators, some of them bellowing and gesticulating. The vote on Rousseff’s fate, originally set for Tuesday, was put off to Wednesday and the final debate stretched into the night. Brazil’s first woman president, 68, is accused of taking illegal state loans to patch budget holes in 2014, masking the country’s problems as it slid into its deepest recession in decades. Latest estimates from independent analysts and pro-impeachment senators are that the upper chamber will easily reach the two-thirds majority — 54 out of 81 senators — to convict Rousseff. Loyalists say they haven’t yet lost hope of saving the Workers’ Party president. “The chances of impeachment not passing and the president being made to step down are virtually nil,” said political analyst Adriano Codato at Parana University. If Rousseff is forced from office, her former vice president turned bitter foe Michel Temer will be immediately sworn in as president until the next scheduled elections in late 2018. Temer, 75, took over in an interim role after Rousseff’s initial suspension in May and at once named a new government with an agenda shifting Brazil to the right. Rousseff, in a 14-hour appearance Monday, defiantly urged senators to acquit her, branding impeachment as a “coup.” She said it would amount to a “political death sentence.” It would bar her from politics for eight years. Lawyers presenting closing arguments on Tuesday could not hold back their emotions as the clock wound down on a crisis that has paralyzed Brazilian politics for months. A lead lawyer for the case against Rousseff, Janaina Paschoal, wept as she asked forgiveness for causing the president “suffering,” but insisted it was the right thing to do. “Impeachment is a constitutional remedy that we need to resort to when the situation gets particularly serious, and that is what has happened,” Paschoal said, rejecting Rousseff’s “coup” claim. “The Brazilian people must be aware that nothing illegal and illegitimate is being done here.” Rousseff’s veteran lawyer Jose Eduardo Cardozo retorted that Rousseff was innocent and was being made to pay for her support of a huge corruption investigation that has snared many of Brazil’s elite. “This is a farce,” he said in a speech during which his voice alternated from shouts to near whispers. “We should ask her forgiveness if she is convicted. History will treat her fairly. History will absolve Dilma Rousseff if you convict her,” he said. Recalling how she was tortured under Brazil’s military dictatorship in the 1970s, Rousseff on Monday had urged senators during her testimony to “vote against impeachment, vote for democracy… Do not accept a coup.” However, momentum to push her out of office appears unstoppable, fueled by deep anger over Brazil’s devastating recession and the vast corruption probe centered on state oil giant Petrobras. Public reaction to the impeachment trial has been marked by widespread indifference, as Brazilians struggle with rising inflation and unemployment. The Workers’ Party under Rousseff and her predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is credited with raising 29 million Brazilians out of poverty. But many now blame the party for the country’s ills, accusing Rousseff of mismanagement in particular. Temer, of the center-right PMDB party, has earned plaudits from investors since taking the interim post. However, it remains uncertain whether he will have voters’ support to push through the austerity reforms he promises. Rousseff has barely double digit approval ratings. But Temer is hardly more popular, according to opinion polls. If sworn in Wednesday, Temer is expected to leave for China to represent Brazil at the G20 international summit, sources close to him said. AFP
Flash floods kill 6 in southern Russia; 1 missing  [SEP]  MOSCOW (AP) - At least six people died as flash floods hit Russia's south, paralyzing traffic across the region and affecting thousands of people, investigators said on Friday. The region, which hosted many events of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, saw rainfall that amounted to the average seen over two months on Wednesday, causing rivers to overflow. The Investigative Committee said in a statement on Friday that six people died when torrential rains and flash floods hit. An elderly woman went missing after she was taken by the gusts of water in the town of Tuapse, the investigators said. Footage on state television showed people being evacuated from villages in inflatable boats, and response teams repairing a section of a collapsed bridge. The floods have damaged roads and railroad bridges, paralyzing traffic. More than 20 trains running along the Black Sea coast have been delayed after a section of a railroad bridge collapsed, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded at nearby stations. Emergency officials offered temporary accommodation and food to the passengers. Russian Railways said on Friday that they have repaired one of the tracks, allowing a train to travel between two major Black Sea coast towns for the first time since Wednesday.
Iowa Democrats Oppose Bill To Let Customers See How Much They Pay for Green Energy  [SEP]  Lawmakers in the Iowa legislature voted to change the way the state runs its energy efficiency programs, containing costs and giving consumers more choice. By a straight party-line vote, Republicans in the Iowa state Senate passed Senate File 2311 Monday night after a raucous debate among legislators. The measure — which was approved in the state House last week — is now in Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds’ hands. The bill places a 2 percent cap on energy efficiency programs for electricity and 1.5 percent cap on natural gas utilities. If passed, utilities will be required to indicate how much customers are paying to help finance energy rebates and other incentives that promote various efficiency programs. Additionally, the measure allows customers the choice to opt out of the efficiency programs altogether. Supporters of the legislation point out that energy customers in Iowa are currently paying hidden costs of around 7 to 9 percent to prop up these efficiency programs. Defending criticism that the changes would diminish energy efficiency in Iowa, GOP lawmakers said the bill simply reduces costs for consumers and gives them a choice as to whether they want to participate. “Provisions in this bill specifically reduce the costs rate-regulated utilities levy on customers for energy efficiency projects by $100 million. “The bill additionally directs rate-regulated utilities to return $100 million to rate payers as a result of federal tax reform legislation,” Republican state Sen. Mark Chelgren said in a Monday statement. “Amazingly, opponents of the bill even disagreed with the requirement for energy efficiency projects to have a positive return on investment.” GOP State Sen. Jake Chapman, another supporter of the bill, argued that the reforms end a hidden tax that has “scammed” residents in the state for years. The GOP lawmaker claimed the changes will return $200 million to utility ratepayers in the first year and $100 million annually after that. Democrats, however, vehemently oppose the legislation, believing it will gut environmentally friendly programs. “This is a really, really bad bill … It undermines a good, strong energy policy that this state has had on a bipartisan basis for several decades,” said Robert Hogg, a Democrat state senator, in a statement to the Des Moines Register. Democratic state Sen. Joe Bolkcom was equally critical. “Iowa has positioned itself as a national leader,” he said to the Courier in Tuesday report. “Putting a cap on these programs is exactly the wrong direction to go. Saving energy is cheaper than building new plants.” A version of this article appeared on The Daily Caller News Foundation website. What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
Opinion | Conservatism needs a new Weekly Standard untainted by Trump  [SEP]  The standard, so to speak, interpretation of the demise of the Weekly Standard is that it is symbolic of the fate of non-Trumpian conservatism. There is something to this analysis, but it is too neat by half. The Standard did not shutter its doors on Friday because it was rejected in the marketplace of ideas. Like most publications, it had lost print circulation in recent years but gained online readership. It did not make a penny of profit, but then magazines of ideas seldom do. They depend on wealthy patrons who will subsidize the losses to promote their worldview — and themselves. From its founding in 1995 until 2009, the Weekly Standard’s owner was Rupert Murdoch. But after buying the Wall Street Journal in 2007, Murdoch presumably saw no need for a small magazine to exert influence in Washington, so he sold it to another conservative billionaire — Philip F. Anschutz of Denver. Anschutz had already created a conservative newspaper known as the Washington Examiner. So now he and Ryan McKibben, the chief executive of Anschutz’s Clarity Media Group, want to focus their resources on taking the Examiner national instead of supporting the Weekly Standard. The Examiner is friendlier to President Trump than is the Standard, so it’s easier to explain to their Republican friends. But it is not clear to what extent that factored into their decision. John Podhoretz, one of the magazine’s co-founders, tweeted: “It actually wasn’t about Trump, or only about Trump on the margins. This was far more in the nature of a weird personal vendetta.” [The Weekly Standard is gone] There’s nothing unusual about a rich owner losing interest in one of his playthings. What makes this case more tragic and infuriating is that Anschutz and McKibben refused entreaties from the Weekly Standard’s editor, Stephen Hayes, to sell the magazine. Rather than allow the magazine to live under new ownership, Anschutz and McKibben murdered it to harvest its subscriber list for the Examiner. So a talented staff of journalists is being thrown out of work just before Christmas in an act that is equal parts destructive, stupid and cruel. The Standardites hope to reopen under a new name and with a new owner. Whether that happens, the Weekly Standard is no more, and it is appropriate to mourn its passing even while hoping for a rebirth. The Weekly Standard was, of course, a conservative magazine, but it is quite possible not to agree with some or even much of what it stood for while still appreciating its feisty editorials, fine reporting, elegant writing, witty satires, and a “back of the book” that offered serious book reviews, unpretentious film reviews, and cultural commentary from the likes of Podhoretz and Joseph Epstein. An awful lot of talented journalists have written for the Standard over the years, including Fred Barnes, David Brooks, Andy Ferguson, Matt Labash, Charles Krauthammer, David Frum, P.J. O’Rourke — and even Tucker Carlson in his pre-demagogic days. As a contributing editor (an honorific with no duties or pay), I was a very small part of the operation. I published my first article in the Standard in March 1999 (a review of two books on the U.S. military interventions in Haiti and Somalia), and my last in August 2017 (a criticism of Trump for not labeling the Charlottesville attack an act of terrorism). There were many articles in between. The most notorious was undoubtedly “The Case for American Empire,” published a month after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which called on the United States not simply to topple noxious regimes in Kabul and Baghdad, but to build better governments in their place. (I have since recanted my support for the war in Iraq — but not in Afghanistan.) Many of my contributions were reviews of works of political or military history. Many others were travelogues reporting from numerous countries including Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel, Lebanon, the Philippines, Tunisia, Colombia and Japan. By 2006, I was in despair about the security situation in Iraq — and then in 2007 and 2008 I wrote articles chronicling the unexpected success of “the surge.” But I was also able to write about lighter fare, including my appreciation for football coach Bill Walsh and historian Daniel Boorstin. In a 2005 article, I celebrated my ability to receive DVDs from Netflix in the mail — much easier, I wrote, than visiting a Blockbuster. (If you’re under 30, ask an old-timer to explain.) The Weekly Standard was run for most of its history by Bill Kristol — a good friend who is gifted with an ironic disposition and a cheerful temperament. While he is a well-known conservative, Kristol is hardly doctrinaire. He opened the Standard to all sorts of viewpoints — many of them entirely apolitical — and then led it into fierce, principled opposition when Trump seized control of the right. I devoutly hope a new Standard will arise to lead the Republican Party out of the moral and political oblivion to which the president is consigning it.
Dozens feared dead after rioting and fire in Venezuelan police station  [SEP]  VALENCIA, Venezuela – Dozens of people were feared dead after rioting and a fire in the cells of a Venezuelan police station, an official and witnesses said on Wednesday, although authorities did not say how many were killed. State official Jesus Santander said the state of Carabobo was in mourning after the incident in the city of Valencia. “Forensic doctors are determining the number of fatalities,” Santander said. A policeman was shot in the leg and was in stable condition and firefighters had extinguished the flames, he said. Venezuelan media said there could be more than 60 fatalities. Prisons in Venezuela are notoriously overcrowded and filled with weapons and drugs. “There are people who are inside those dungeons ... and the authorities do not know they exist because they do not dare to enter,” said Humberto Prado, a prisons rights activist.
China 'disinvited' from major US military exercise over South China Sea  [SEP]  A Pentagon spokesman said in a statement that "China's behavior is inconsistent with the principles and purposes of the RIMPAC exercise," and has "disinvited the PLA Navy from the 2018 Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) Exercise." The decision to withdraw China's invitation was made by Defense Secretary James Mattis in coordination with the White House, according to a US official, after Beijing's recent deployment of missile systems and the first landing of a Chinese bomber aircraft in the South China Sea The same defense official told CNN that the US has its own imagery showing China's deployment of anti-ship missiles, surface-to-air missiles and jammers. China said last week that it landed long-range bombers for the first time on an island in the South China Sea, the latest in a series of maneuvers putting Beijing at odds with its neighbors and Washington over China's growing military presence around disputed islands. The People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) announced it successfully organized the takeoff and landing of several bombers, including the nuclear-capable H-6K, on an unspecified island. The PLA claimed the mission was a part of China's aim to achieve a broader regional reach, quicker mobilization, and greater strike capabilities. "The islands in the South China Sea are China's territory," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said in a statement Monday. "The relevant military activities are normal trainings and other parties shouldn't over-interpret them. US challenged by China's navy in South China Sea RIMPAC is a US Navy exercise held every other year and have previously included a variety of forces from different nations. Participating in the last RIMPAC in 2016 were 45 ships, 200 aircraft and more than 25,000 people from 26 nations, the defense official told CNN. Mattis is scheduled to travel to China and Japan at the end of June, defense officials have acknowledged.
Greens crusade to topple Labor in Batman  [SEP]  The Greens will be hoping to make it a dark night for Labor as the parties battle it out for the Melbourne seat of Batman. However, senior Labor figures remain confident former ACTU boss Ged Kearney can hold the seat, vacated by David Feeney over his dual citizenship. With the Liberal Party not fielding a candidate, the by-election will be a test of whether the Greens' march into inner-metropolitan seats continues apace or Labor is showing signs of appealing to a young "hipster" demographic. A win would give the Greens two seats in the House of Representatives. Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese is confident his party will retain Batman, which is held by a margin of one per cent. He says it's a choice between having someone who could be a voice in a Labor government or an MP who waits for decisions to be made and then protests against them. Greens leader Richard Di Natale, who has appeared regularly with candidate Alex Bhathal, has sought to make the campaign about fighting the Adani coal mine in Queensland and being fairer to refugees. He says the community has "outgrown the Labor party". Ten candidates are running in the seat, which is named after the early settler and explorer John Batman.
The Scot who pioneered football in Russia  [SEP]  Scotland’s national football team won’t be jetting off to Russia this week. But that’s not to say that a Scottish presence isn’t to be found at the 2018 World Cup. Delve back into the history of football in Russia and you’ll find that its roots hail from none other than the green fields of Caledonia. Arthur Davidovich MacPherson is generally considered to be the father of Russian football. At a gala dinner celebrating the centenary of the Russian Football Union, this relatively unknown Scotsman was given a special toast by Putin for his contribution to football in Russia. Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini both found themselves raising a glass to Arthur MacPherson. A true all-rounder, MacPherson was also responsible for introducing lawn tennis and rowing to Russia. He was awarded the Order of Saint Stanislaus by Tsar Nicholas II - the only person ever to receive this honour for services to sport. MacPherson was born in St Petersburg in 1870 to a family of Glaswegian shipyard owners. His grandfather, Murdoch MacPherson, moved to Russia to help the tsars establish steelworks and shipyards. A stock exchange dealer and timber merchant, MacPherson worked hard to promote football in Russia, playing in some of the country’s earliest matches. The sport first appeared as a way for ex-pats in St Petersburg to preserve a sense of their heritage in this new home. Scottish and English workers would wait by the ports for the crews of visiting British ships to provide opposition teams. Soon the beautiful game was taking hold among the locals too. The St Petersburg Football League, Russia’s first organised league, was founded in 1901 with MacPherson taking on the role of chairman. One of its first teams was the Nevka side, made up of Scottish workers from the Samson weaving mill in St Petersburg. A rival team, Nevsky, soon formed from English workers from another of the city’s mills. The Scottish team went on to become the first champions of the Russian football league. It’s thought that the Russian mill owners created football teams for their workers to discourage them from drinking vodka on weekends. Many of the Russian football clubs we know today such as Dynamo Moscow originate from these first factory teams. The popularity of the sport grew and grew and in 1912 MacPherson founded the All-Russian Football Union, becoming its first President. As Russia was rocked by the tumult of WWI and increasing resistance to the Romanov regime, the development of football in the country shuddered to a halt and the story of its founding father takes a very tragic turn. After the Revolution, MacPherson was arrested by the Soviets for introducing “bourgeois” sports into Russia. He was left to die of typhoid in a Moscow prison in 1919. It’s said that when MacPherson’s body was discovered it was unrecognisable. He could only be identified by a piece of paper with his name scrawled on that he’d managed to tie to his own wrist. One of his sons, Arthur Jr, went on to become a spy for the British secret service. Like his father, he was also a keen tennis player and competed in both Wimbledon and the US Open. MacPherson’s gravestone can be found in the Smolensky Cemetery in St Petersburg. The inscription reads: “Arthur Davidovich MacPherson 1870-1919: First Chairman of the All-Russia Union of Lawn Tennis Club 1908-17 and of the Football Union 1912-13. Member of the Russian Olympic Committee 1911-13”. So when watching the 2018 World Cup, don’t forget to join Vladimir Putin in raising a glass to Arthur MacPherson.
LeBron James Becomes Youngest NBA Player To Join 30,000-Point Club  [SEP]  Heading into last night's game between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the San Antonio Spurs, LeBron James needed seven points to reach the 30,000 career point milestone. He finished the game with 28 points. While that was more than enough to get James into the club, it was not however enough for the Cavaliers to win the game. The Spurs won 114-102 in San Antonio. James became the seventh player with 30,000 career points when he hit a jumper with one second left in the first quarter. In addition, James became the first NBA player to add 7,000 rebounds and 7,000 assists to his point total. He was recognized by the arena before the second quarter and got a standing ovation from Spurs fans. James patted his heart and said "thank you so much." ESPN reports on his reaction to the career event: "Just a special moment," James said after the game. "I just started thinking about everything. My journey from being a kid who first picked up a basketball when I was 5 years old to playing organized basketball when I was 9 all the way up to this point. "I give a lot of thanks to a lot of people. This is a special moment. It's something I never set out to do. I'm not even a score-first guy when it comes to playing basketball. I love getting my teammates involved and seeing my teammates be excited about scoring and me getting the assist and things of that nature." James is not known for being a scorer, but "[dominating] in all facets —rebounding, assisting, defending, getting some blocked shots...," explained James. He has averaged 27.1 points a game since he began playing in the league in 2003, at the age of 18 and right out of high school. The 14-time All-Star is also the youngest person to join the prestigious point club. He's done it all at the age of 33 years and 24 days. He bested Kobe Bryant, who was 34 years and 104 days when he reached the mark. Others on the points' list are: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (38,387 points), Karl Malone (36,928), Kobe Bryant (33,643), Michael Jordan (32,292), Wilt Chamberlain (31,419) and Dirk Nowitzki (30,808). The complete list of participants for the NBA's All-Star Game on Feb. 18 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles was unveiled Tuesday night. James will be the captain for the Eastern Conference and Stephen Curry will head the Western Conference.
What to expect as the 2018 Arab League summit opens in Saudi Arabia  [SEP]  Shoshana is a Verdict reporter covering global business, economics, and finance. She can be reached at shoshana.kedem@verdict.co.uk Foreign Ministers from 22 Arab states will gather in the eastern city of Dammam in Saudi Arabia this weekend for the 29th Arab League Summit. The meeting comes as leaders from the UK, US and France have pledged to escalate a military intervention in Syria’s civil war. Yesterday Arab leaders met in the Saudi capital Riyadh for a preparatory meeting to fix the agenda for the one day summit. The Arab-Israeli conflict will be on the agenda with members expected to try to prevent Israel from gaining a rotating seat on the UN Security Council. Winning a Security Council seat requires a two-thirds majority in the 193-nation General Assembly. Candidates are proposed by the five regional groups but election to the council is voted on by the full assembly. A vote will be taken by members of the UN General Assembly on 8 June. Turkey and Iran’s influence in the Arab world is also likely to feature, as both countries have been accused of meddling in Arab affairs. Mahmoud Afifi, the official spokesperson of the Arab League, has said the summit would also address Libya and civil wars in Yemen and Syria. Afifi said the agenda would however be dominated by the expanding role of Gulf arch-rival Iran in the region and its ally Turkey. At the opening session of Thursday’s preparatory meeting, the Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said the Palestinian cause is the most central and crucial issue in the region. He added that reaching an agreement on Jerusalem would be integral to making peace in the Middle East. An ongoing diplomatic row between the host country and four other Arab countries has cast doubt over whether the Qataris will take part in the event this year. An invitation has been extended to the Gulf state that lies on Saudi Arabia’s north-east border. Antonio Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations, Moussa Faki, the chairman of the African Union Commission, and Federica Mogherini, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, are all expected to be there. Syria’s foreign minister will not take part in the talks after their membership was suspended in November 2011 over the country’s seven-year civil war. Why does it matter? The meeting will be the first time Arab League summit members meet since Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain cut diplomatic ties with Qatar 10 months ago. The row broke out last year after states accused Doha of being a state-sponsor of terrorism. They have also slammed Qatar for its close relationship with Iran, who other GCC states despise. The summit will also be the first time leaders from the Arab world get together after US President Donald Trump said he would move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in December. Meanwhile, the three-year military intervention in Yemen’s civil war by a coalition of Arab League members including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Sudan, the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain is ongoing. During the summit leaders will discuss peace talks between Israel and Palestinians. Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed Bin Salman has held a series of discussions with Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner on a new peace deal. The peace deal is based on Trump’s pledge to reach the “deal of the century” between the warring sides. The Arab Summit comes after a chemical weapons attack on the Damascus suburb of Douma last week has been condemned by leaders in the UK, the US, and France. The summit was originally scheduled to take place at the end of March but was changed to accommodate Egypt’s presidential elections.
Global ‘WannaCry’ ransomware cyberattack seeks cash for data  [SEP]  LONDON — A global “ransomware” cyberattack, unprecedented in scale, had technicians scrambling to restore Britain’s crippled hospital network Saturday and secure the computers that run factories, banks, government agencies and transport systems in many other nations. The worldwide effort to extort cash from computer users spread so widely that Microsoft quickly changed its policy, making security fixes available for free for the older Windows systems still used by millions of individuals and smaller businesses. A malware tracking map showed “WannaCry” infections popping up around the world. Britain canceled or delayed treatments for thousands of patients, even people with cancer. Train systems were hit in Germany and Russia, and phone companies in Madrid and Moscow. Renault’s futuristic assembly line in Slovenia, where rows of robots weld car bodies together, was stopped cold. In Brazil, the social security system had to disconnect its computers and cancel public access. The state-owned oil company Petrobras and Brazil’s Foreign Ministry also disconnected computers as a precautionary measure, and court systems went down, too. Britain’s home secretary said one in five of 248 National Health Service groups had been hit. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said all but six of the NHS trusts back to normal Saturday. The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Center was “working round the clock” to restore vital health services, while urging people to update security software fixes, run anti-virus software and back up their data elsewhere. Who perpetrated this wave of attacks remains unknown. Two security firms — Kaspersky Lab and Avast — said they identified the malicious software in more than 70 countries. Both said Russia was hit hardest. These hackers “have caused enormous amounts of disruption— probably the biggest ransomware cyberattack in history,” said Graham Cluley, a veteran of the anti-virus industry in Oxford, England. And all this may be just a taste of what’s coming, another cyber security expert warned. Computer users worldwide — and everyone else who depends on them — should assume that the next big “ransomware” attack has already been launched, and just hasn’t manifested itself yet, Ori Eisen, who founded the Trusona cybersecurity firm in Scottsdale, Arizona, told The Associated Press. The attack held hospitals and other entities hostage by freezing computers, encrypting data and demanding money through online bitcoin payments. But it appears to be “low-level” stuff, Eisen said Saturday, given the amount of ransom demanded — $300 at first, rising to $600 before it destroys files hours later. He said the same thing could be done to crucial infrastructure, like nuclear power plants, dams or railway systems. “This is child’s play, what happened. This is not the serious stuff yet. What if the same thing happened to 10 nuclear power plants, and they would shut down all the electricity to the grid? What if the same exact thing happened to a water dam or to a bridge?” he asked. “Today, it happened to 10,000 computers,” Eisen said. “There’s no barrier to do it tomorrow to 100 million computers.” This is already believed to be the biggest online extortion attack ever recorded, disrupting services in nations as diverse as the U.S., Ukraine, Brazil, Spain and India. Europol, the European Union’s police agency, said the onslaught was at “an unprecedented level and will require a complex international investigation to identify the culprits.” In Russia, government agencies insisted that all attacks had been resolved. Russian Interior Ministry, which runs the national police, said the problem had been “localized” with no information compromised. Russia’s health ministry said its attacks were “effectively repelled.” The ransomware exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows that was purportedly identified by the U.S. National Security Agency for its own intelligence-gathering purposes. Hackers said they stole the tools from the NSA and dumped them on the internet. It could have been much worse if not for a young cybersecurity researcher who helped to halt its spread by accidentally activating a so-called “kill switch” in the malicious software. The 22-year-old Britain-based researcher, identified online only as MalwareTech, explained Saturday that he spotted a hidden web address in the “WannaCrypt” code and made it official by registering its domain name. That inexpensive move redirected the attacks to MalwareTech’s server, which operates as a “sinkhole” to keep malware from escaping. “Because WannaCrypt used a single hardcoded domain, my registration of it caused all infections globally to believe they were inside a sandbox … thus we initially unintentionally prevented the spread,” the researcher said, humbly and anonymously, in his blog post. His move may have saved governments and companies millions of dollars and slowed the outbreak before U.S.-based computers were more widely infected. Indeed, while FedEx Corp. reported that its Windows computers were “experiencing interference” from malware — it wouldn’t say if it had been hit by the ransomware — other impacts in the U.S. were not readily apparent on Saturday. That said, the threat hasn’t disappeared, the MalwareTech researcher said. “One thing that is very important to note is our sinkholing only stops this sample and there is nothing stopping them removing the domain check and trying again, so it’s incredibly important that any unpatched systems are patched as quickly as possible,” he warned. The kill switch also couldn’t help those already infected. Short of paying, options for these individuals and companies are usually limited to recovering data files from a backup, if available, or living without them. Security experts said it appeared to be caused by a self-replicating piece of software that enters companies when employees click on email attachments, then spreads quickly as employees share documents. The security holes it exploits were disclosed weeks ago by TheShadowBrokers, a mysterious hacking group. Microsoft swiftly released software “patches” to fix those holes, but many users still haven’t installed updates or still use older versions of Windows. Microsoft had made fixes for older systems, such as 2001′s Windows XP, available only to mostly larger organizations, including Britain’s National Health Service, that paid extra for extended technical support. In light of Friday’s attacks, Microsoft announced that it’s making the fixes free to all. Cluley said “There’s clearly some culpability on the part of the U.S. intelligence services. Because they could have done something ages ago to get this problem fixed, and they didn’t do it.” “It’s very, very difficult these days, with encryption, to spy on people,” Cluley added. “But I don’t think that those concerns should hide the fact that ALL of us need to be protected … We’re living an online life, and we all deserve security there.”
Why the attempt to assassinate Maduro?  [SEP]  The attempt to assassinate Nicolas Maduro, president of Venezuela, has failed. This news is days-old. But, the facts are reiterated boldly. And, there are a few questions, and a few answers to some “progressives” now in close collaboration with imperialism. The assassination attempt was made while Maduro was addressing the nation on live TV during a military celebration in Caracas. Seven National Guard members were injured in the attempt. It was the 81st-anniversary parade of the National Guard on August 4, 2018. Explosive loaded drones were used in the assassination attempt. However, snipers shot down the killer-drones. “They have tried to kill me today, and everything points towards the right wing forces, the Venezuela ultra-right in alliance with the Colombian ultra-right, and the name of Juan Manuel Santos is behind this assassination attempt.” Santos is the out-going president of Colombian. “[F]irst elements of the investigation point towards Bogota.” However, in a statement, the Colombian foreign ministry described Maduro’s indication as “absurd” and “baseless.” Santos claimed in an innocent tone that he was fully focused on his granddaughter’s baptism on the day of the murder-attempt. It sounds like someone has to fly with an explosive-filled drone if the person plans to make an attack. But, it should be mentioned that Santos recently suggested in public statements: Maduro’s mandate is close to coming to an end. Santos said as recently as on July 30: “I hope it is tomorrow even. Colombia would be willing and ready to help in any way possible.” Maduro also indicated the assassination attempt had been financed from Miami. The US authorities quickly tried to get far away from the assassination attempt. John Bolton, the White House security advisor, said: “Without a doubt there wasn’t any participation from the US government in the absolute.” Security measures following the murder attempt arrested a few persons including two participants in the 2014 anti-government street violence in Venezuela. The two street-violence participants also have a criminal record. Countries, in continents, including Bolivia, Cuba, El Salvador, India, Iran, Nicaragua, Russia, Spain, Syria, Turkey, Uruguay, Vietnam condemned the assassination attempt, and expressed solidarity with the Venezuelan leader. A number of Caribbean island-countries, regional bloc ALBA, International bodies such as the Union of South American Nations, Community of Latin American and Caribbean Nations, and the World Peace Council also repudiated the attack. The Communist Party of Argentina, the FARC in Colombia, Al Fatah, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the Popular Vanguard and New Nation Parties in Costa Rica, the Guasu Front in Paraguay, the New Movement Party and the Broad Front in Peru, and many other political and social organizations in regions and countries denounced the assassination attempt. Maduro-allies including the Communist Party of Venezuela and Homeland for All Party (PPT), and grassroots organizations in Venezuela and in many other countries took similar stand on the assassination attempt. Diego Maradona, the football legend, tweeted: “an attack on the leader of the Bolivarian Revolution is an attack on the people of Venezuela.” However, the rightist opposition groups in Venezuela played down the assassination attempt while the ultra-rightists regretted with the failure. The First Justice party (PJ) indicated: Similar attack may happen again: “It would be a grave error to presume […] that the events of yesterday won’t be repeated in the same, or a worse, way”. A few of the rightists claimed: The incident was fabricated. Opposition hardliner Maria Corina Machado said: “Maduro will only be got rid of […] by force.” In countries, political, claiming to be civil and rights organizations with ties to imperialism kept their silence intact. They failed to denounce the assassination attempt although international agreements define assassination of a head of state as “terrorist act”. A few from the imperialist media also presented a story with an interrogative tone: “Was the attempt staged by Maduro?” So, one finds: imperialist media and rightists are in the same wave length. On the other hand, “Soldiers in T-Shirts”, an anti-government group, has claimed responsibility for the attack, code named “Operation Fenix”. Factors of Power, a Miami-based private news network, presented the statement. The statement echoed demands being made by the right-wing politicians that include abide by the rightist-packed National Assembly and go for “true and free” elections. It called on “everyone to take to the streets”, to “take power,” and install a “transition government.” The statement claims that the assassination attempt tried to “restore constitutional order.” Patricia Poleo, a Miami-based journalist and a critic of the Venezuela government, read the public statement issued by the claimants of the attempt. Patricia is accused of being involved in the assassination of anti-corruption police investigator Danilo Anderson in 2004. One of the tweets made by the “T-Shirts” said: “The operation was to fly two drones carrying C4 explosive to the presidential platform”, but the drones were downed “before [these reached] their objective. We showed that [the government is] vulnerable, today we didn’t achieve it but it’s only a question of time.” Twitter account of the “T-Shirt” claims that it’s a combination of “military and civilian patriots”, and “rebels.” The questions are: Why the attempt to assassinate Maduro was made? Why further threats are made: “More such attempts will follow”? Why the rightists find Maduro as their enemy? There was attempt to assassinate Rafael Correa in 2010, the then president of Ecuador. The list of the assassinated anti-imperialist political leaders is very long. The questions are: Who are assassinated? Why are they assassinated? It’s not that all assassinated political leaders were anti-imperialist. But, many anti-imperialists have been assassinated. For years, imperialism has targeted leaders standing against imperialism. Leaders choosing the path of self-reliance have been targeted by imperialism. Leaders moving away from imperialist orbit have also been targeted. Imperialism also targeted its former allies and lackeys. A few of them have been overthrown through coup d’états. A few were blown out in airplanes. A few faced mysterious deaths. The recent tact is “democracy movement”. Assassination attempts are made when imperialism fails to find scope for regime change through fabricated political “movements”, which appear democratic, but, in its core, is faithful to imperialism. Attempts to physically eliminate political leaders are made when imperialism finds machinated crisis of different types are failing to unseat its enemy. Imperialism resorts to killings when it finds it’s difficult to mobilize social and political forces required to overthrow the political leadership it considers its enemy. In these attempts to assassinate, organize “political movements”, initiate machinated crises, imperialism has to rely on its local allies – lackeys. These allies range from political parties to unions to so-called civil society to disgruntled elements within the targeted government to so-called rights, for-the-poor, cooperative, cultural, youth, etc. organizations. It’s a mobilization of social and political forces faithful to the external master. In Venezuela, the rightists are finding it difficult to succeed with their political fight. They are failing to mobilize other social forces. They are failing to use discontent whatever is there, and aspirations. The situation leads them to the terrorist activity – assassinate Maduro. So, the assassination attempt is an indication of the rightists’ failure in political fight, is an indication of its cornered position. However, the position may change as politics and political position are not static in any society. This depends upon handling of contradictions, management of economy, struggles in the sphere of politics, keeping alliance alive. It’ll be a pure childish imagination, and a reflection of having no idea about politics if anyone expects that all the moves and measures at all the times will be absolutely error-free in Venezuela. In no society, it’s possible to move through an absolute error-free path of political and ideological struggle. There are “progressives”, “lefts”, “adherents” of Marx and Lenin in countries, who claim Chavez “didn’t” follow, and Maduro “isn’t” following the correct path to socialism, their anti-imperialism is “pseudo”. These “progressives”, etc. forget to admit that imperialism isn’t making assault on this brand of proper “progressives”, etc. Imperialism is making assault on this Chavez-Maduro duo. Then, according to these “progressives”, etc., it comes out that imperialism is behaving “fool” as the duo “isn’t” for progress. This flock of “progressives”, etc. has forgotten the observation Mao made in 1939: “I hold that it is bad as far as we are concerned if a person, a political party, an army or a school is not attacked by the enemy, for in that case it would definitely mean that we have sunk to the level of the enemy. It is good if we are attacked by the enemy, since it proves that we have drawn a clear line of demarcation between the enemy and ourselves. It is still better if the enemy attacks us wildly and paints us as utterly black and without a single virtue; it demonstrates that we have not only drawn a clear line of demarcation between the enemy and ourselves but achieved a great deal in our work.” These “progressives”, etc. are bigger and larger revolutionaries than Mao. So, they don’t listen to Mao, turn ultra-left overnight, and proudly extend their hands of collaboration to imperialism and its lackeys. These “progressives”, etc. very often or regularly take the path, which has been charted by imperialism. In countries in regions including South Asia, these “progressives”, neo-“progressives”, etc. will stand with the rightist forces; oppose errors, corruption, economic difficulties in the way imperialism gets benefit; cordially be-friend extreme rightists, and get active with imperialism-designed democracy. But, they will never look at the question: Why attempt to assassinate Maduro is made and why these “progressives”, etc. are being spared?
Northern California drenched, but state's drought far from over  [SEP]  That marks a major improvement from a year ago, when only 3% of the state was drought-free, according to data from the US Drought Monitor. The storms have dumped more than 7 inches of rain since Monday and the National Weather Service says 6-12 feet of snow has fallen in the Sierra Nevada, where the snowpack is critical to California's water supply. While Northern California is soaked, it's still bone dry down south. Most of Southern California and several central areas of the state remain in extreme and exceptional drought, according to data released by the US Drought Monitor on Thursday. More than 26 million people are in drought-stricken areas. The long-term impact of the drought has been "more severe and widespread in southern sections," noted the report. Reservoirs and wells are still below normal levels there. 'The worst drought that California has ever seen' California has grappled with the drought for the last five years. Parched conditions fueled numerous, deadly wildfires across the state. More than 102 million drought-stricken trees in the state have dried up and died since 2010, the USDA estimated. Many homes have run out of running water because of dried up wells. It also has devastated farms, forcing layoffs of thousands of farm workers because of reduced water allocations. In 2014, California Gov. Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency and warned that the state was facing "perhaps the worst drought that California has ever seen since records (began) about 100 years ago." The next year, he imposed the first ever mandatory water restrictions on residents, businesses and farms. He also ordered cities and towns to reduce usage by 25% in 2015. Residents dealt with their new reality of crisp, yellow lawns and dusty, unwashed cars. Inmates at a state prison in Vacaville, California, install a drought-tolerant garden in October. The garden will be watered using reclaimed water from the prison's kitchen. California is entering its fifth year of severe drought. California State Assemblyman Devon Mathis speaks to members of the media after he helped secure a donation of 100,000 water bottles in September. More than 300 homes in Porterville, California, were out of running water because of dried-up wells. Evacuee James Logan embraces his wife, Lisa, as they listen to an update about a wildfire in Clearlake Oakes, California, in August. Drought conditions have fueled numerous wildfires across the state. Firefighters hike down a hill in Clearlake, California, as they mop up hot spots from the Rocky Fire in August.

Jerry Brown holds a chart showing the statewide average precipitation. The governor declared a drought emergency for the state, saying it faced "perhaps the worst drought that California has ever seen since records (began) about 100 years ago." While the recent storms in Northern California have triggered flooding, mudslides and forced dozens of people from their homes, it has also brought relief. The storms have replenished the major reservoirs and the Sierra Nevada snowpack. The National Weather Service says Lake Tahoe's volume has grown by about 33.6 billion gallons since the beginning of the year. "Bye bye Drought. Don't let the door hit you on the way out," tweeted the National Weather Service in Reno, Nevada The drought has also affected areas beyond California, extending to other Western states including parts of Nevada and Oregon.

Missouri governor resigns amid swirling investigations  [SEP]  JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens announced Tuesday that he will resign, ending a tumultuous 17 months in office marked by criminal investigations and with the Legislature considering whether to try to impeach him. The Republican governor has repeatedly denied any criminal wrongdoing. Here's a look at some of the allegations: Greitens faces a felony charge of tampering with computer data for allegedly disclosing to his political fundraiser a list of top donors to a veterans charity he founded, The Mission Continues, without the charity's permission. The charge says the incident occurred in April 2015. The Associated Press first reported in October 2016 — a month before Greitens' election — that his campaign had accessed a charity list containing the names, emails and phone numbers of individuals, corporations and other nonprofit organizations who gave at least $1,000 to The Mission Continues. The AP reported that Greitens' campaign had raised nearly $2 million from those who had previously given significant amounts to the veterans' charity. Greitens acknowledged in an April 2017 settlement with the Missouri Ethics Commission that his campaign had used the charity donor list. He amended his campaign finance reports to show the list as an in-kind donation valued at $600 received in March 2015 from then-campaign manager Danny Laub. But Laub testified this year that he wasn't the source of the donor list. A House investigatory committee report released May 2 indicates that Greitens himself received the donor list in 2014 while CEO of the charity so he could call key supporters to explain he was stepping down. The report said Greitens later directed political aides to work off the charity's list to raise money for his gubernatorial campaign — even though he had signed an agreement never to disclose the charity's confidential donor information. On May 14, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner abruptly dropped a felony invasion-of-privacy charge against Greitens alleging that he took a photo of an at least partially nude woman without her consent in March 2015 and transmitted it in a way that could be accessed by a computer. Gardner said the charge could be refiled. The woman, who is Greitens' former hairdresser, said Greitens bound her hands to exercise rings, blindfolded her and removed her clothing before taking the photo and threatening to disclose it if she ever spoke of the affair. Authorities haven't released her name. Greitens' affair became public on Jan. 10, when St. Louis TV station KMOV aired portions of an audio recording secretly made by the woman's ex-husband in which she told him about her interaction with Greitens. Following Greitens' indictment Feb. 22, the Missouri House created a special committee to investigate the governor. It released a graphic report April 11 containing testimony from the woman alleging that Greitens may have coerced her into oral sex after taking the unwanted photo and had slapped and shoved her during subsequent sexual encounters. Greitens has acknowledged having a consensual affair with the woman but has denied any violence. He has not directly answered questions about whether he took the photo. Gardner dropped the charge after a judge ruled she would have to answer questions under oath from Greitens' attorneys, who had attacked her handling of the case. A judge on Tuesday ordered a secretive group supportive of Greitens, A New Missouri, to turn over documents subpoenaed by a Missouri House committee considering whether to try to impeach the governor. The committee said it was looking into whether Greitens used the A New Missouri to circumvent Missouri's campaign finance disclosure laws. A lawyer for the group, who also represents Greitens' campaign, said Tuesday that the group was considering appealing the order. A New Missouri conceals its donors' identities the judge ruled that it could redact their names from the subpoenaed documents. Washington University in St. Louis said this month that it is reviewing whether Greitens improperly used the grant funding he received to write and promote his 2015 book, "Resilience." The university served as the administrator for a grant from the John Templeton Foundation. The foundation's grant agreement prohibits using funds "to influence the outcome of any specific public election," and the university's policies also bar grant funds from being used for campaign activities. The school announced its review after the May 2 House report included testimony in which Laub said he was paid both by Greitens and through the grant in early 2015 to simultaneously promote Greitens' political aspirations and the release of his book. A lawsuit against Greitens in Cole County alleges he violated the state's open records law while using a cellphone app that automatically deletes messages after they are read. The Confide app prevents recipients from saving, forwarding, printing or taking screenshots of messages. Hawley also launched an investigation last year after The Kansas City Star reported Greitens and some of his staff had Confide accounts. Hawley's report, released March 1, said it didn't appear Greitens' staff violated records laws. But Hawley said he lacked authority to issue subpoena-like demands compelling people to provide information while investigating alleged Sunshine Law or record-retention law violations. Hawley has said he would reopen the investigation if granted such authority.
Scientists Confirm Uranus Stinks  [SEP]  Uranus stinks. And we're not joking. The enigmatic outer solar system planet has long had a credibility problem, what with it being the butt of countless immature jokes. Now, astronomers have just discovered a gas in Uranus' clouds that does nothing to curtail the giggles. At all. The new study, published in the journal Nature Astronomy, has discovered the chemical signature of hydrogen sulfide, a compound that gives rotten eggs their distinctive stench, in the planet's clouds. Besides launching a thousand new smelly planet puns, this finding could transform our understanding of how our solar system evolved. It also may help us to understand the atmospheres of massive planets orbiting other stars. First, a bit of background: Uranus has only been visited by a spacecraft once, when NASA's Voyager 2 zipped past the planet in 1986. The flyby produced many beautiful and iconic views of the almost featureless, light-blue world. Astronomers have made countless ground-based observations of Uranus, too, in the hopes of better understanding the composition of its atmosphere. Despite these efforts, however, we know surprisingly little about this enigmatic planet. But the discovery of hydrogen sulfide is a big step forward, and it could only be done using one of the planet's most powerful observatories. Using the Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrometer (NIFS) that is attached to the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii, astronomers were able to detect the very slight spectroscopic signature of hydrogen sulfide in the uppermost layers of Uranus' clouds. This whiff of hydrogen sulfide is only the tip of the odoriferous iceberg, however; the presence of this gas is indicative of a huge reservoir below the obscuring cloud deck. "Only a tiny amount [of hydrogen sulfide] remains above the clouds as a saturated vapour," said co-investigator Leigh Fletcher, of the University of Leicester, U.K., in a Gemini North statement. "And this is why it is so challenging to capture the signatures of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide above cloud decks of Uranus. The superior capabilities of Gemini finally gave us that lucky break." Astronomers have long argued over whether hydrogen sulfide or ammonia dominate Uranus' clouds. It is well-known that the inner massive planets, Jupiter and Saturn, have atmospheres dominated by ammonia ice, whereas Uranus (and presumably Neptune) do not. It's those very differences in atmospheric compositions that place Jupiter and Saturn in the "gas giant" category and Uranus and Neptune in the "ice giant" category, and these differences reveal an insight as to where the planets formed. "During our Solar System's formation the balance between nitrogen and sulphur (and hence ammonia and Uranus's newly-detected hydrogen sulfide) was determined by the temperature and location of planet's formation," said Fletcher. The thought is that early in our solar system's history, the massive planets migrated from where they initially formed, eventually settling into the stable orbits we see them in today. Through the analysis of the chemicals in their clouds, astronomers can now formulate theories as to how far away from the sun these giant worlds formed and where they migrated from. With this information in mind, astronomers can then look to other stars and gain an insight as to how and where giant exoplanets formed. This is all very interesting, but the biggest question scientists are likely answering right now is: If we could smell Uranus' atmosphere, would it kill us? "If an unfortunate human were ever to descend through Uranus's clouds, they would be met with very unpleasant and odiferous conditions," said lead author Patrick Irwin, of the University of Oxford, U.K., also in the accompanying release. But it's not the stench that will kill you. "Suffocation and exposure in the negative 200 degrees Celsius atmosphere made of mostly hydrogen, helium, and methane would take its toll long before the smell," he concluded.
Russian Embassy Official Says No Hacking-Related Inquiry From Qatar  [SEP]  MOSCOW (Sputnik) — Qatar has not officially inquired the Russian Embassy in Doha in connection with the alleged Russian hackers' role in an unfolding diplomatic crisis with Qatar's Gulf and Arab neighbors, an embassy official told Sputnik. "There were no official appeals by the authorities of Qatar to the Russian Embassy," the official said Wednesday following US reports alleging that Russian hackers "planted" pro-Iranian reports attributed to the Qatari leader on the state's news service that is said to have triggered the crisis.
Shining torch dazzled bus driver moments before fatal accident  [SEP]  In November 1941 the blackout restrictions were in full operation in Preston as the Second World War raged on. On the third Tuesday of the month, John Joseph Newton, aged 74, a retired fish and chip shop proprietor, was heading back on foot to his home on Tulketh Brow after conducted some business. Sadly as he entered the pedestrian crossing at the Garstang Road, North Road and Moor Lane roundabout, disaster struck. The driver of a single decker Ribble bus heading into town was approaching the crossing and distracted by the flashing beam of a torch. He swerved his vehicle, knocking down the pensioner. Having felt the bus bump into something, he stopped it immediately and was horrified to discover Mr Newton’s body crushed beneath the rear nearside wheel. Unfortunately, despite the swift arrival of the ambulance service, nothing could be done to save the victim’s life. An inquest was opened the following day before the deputy coroner Mr A L Ashton, with the bus driver Harold Holder, of Manchester, telling the hearing how he had been distracted by the flashing torch and in consequence had not seen Mr Newton on the pedestrian crossing. He stated that once he got out of his bus, the apparent torch man had continued on his way. This man was seen as a vital witness and the inquest was adjourned for a week, with the police appealing for the man to come forward. There was also some debate as to whether in fact the victim had been carrying a torch that was found at the scene, and that he could have flashed it in the direction of the bus as he stepped on the crossing. When the inquest was resumed, the torch man was still unidentified, but another witness of the accident, Edward Machin, aged 52, a joiner of Arkwright Road, gave evidence stating: “As I got near the roundabout on foot, I saw someone flash a torch, I then heard a crash. As we waited for medical assistance for Mr Newton, the bus driver approached me and asked if I had flashed a torch, which I had not.” After a brief consultation, the inquest jury brought in a verdict of ‘Death by Misadventure’, with the deputy coroner expressing sympathy for the family of the deceased. He then pointed out the danger of flashing torches at motorists, particularly during the blackout, stating that the beam should always be pointed at the ground. In July 1942, the widow of the victim, Alice Mary Ann Newton, aged 77, appeared at the Manchester Assizes to claim damages for the death of her husband by suing the Ribble Motor Services Ltd. The plaintiff’s case was that the accident was due to the negligence of the bus driver. For the defence it was claimed that the victim had stepped suddenly onto the level crossing and could possibly have been using a flash light. Mr Justice Stables, giving judgement for the plaintiff for £293 ( the equivalent of £10,300 these days) and costs, stated: “The fact that I am finding for the plaintiff does not mean there is any suggestion of criminal negligence on the part of the driver. “I am satisfied that the deceased was killed on a pedestrian crossing whilst possibly using a torch. I am satisfied that the bus was being driven too fast. I am not quite sure if it is the bus driver who is primarily responsible for that. Bus drivers have to keep up to a schedule.” Sadly, this was the maternal grandfather who I would never have the chance to meet, as for the £10,300 I never saw any of that either.
Rape and murder of 8-year-old Pak girl: She may been the victim of serial killer, says official  [SEP]  A serial killer may have been behind the rape and murder of young girl in Pakistan whose killing sparked deadly clashes, an official said Saturday. Rana Sanaullah, the home minister for Punjab province, said DNA testing has linked the killing to at least five other cases of child abuse and murder in the city of Kasur. Police have detained eight suspects, including two relatives of the girl. The eight-year-old girl went missing last week while heading to a nearby home for Quranic studies. The discovery of her body, which was found in a garbage bin Tuesday, ignited clashes between residents and police that killed two people and wounded three others. The residents say the authorities were slow to respond to the girl’s disappearance, charges denied by police. The city appeared calm but tense on Saturday after three days of clashes. Businesses reopened, but police and paramilitary troops were still out in force and guarding government buildings. Sanaullah expressed hope for a breakthrough, saying new footage from surveillance cameras showed a man with a thin beard, who resembles police sketches of the suspect, walking near her house. He said the head of the investigation was replaced by another seasoned officer following complaints by the victim’s father.
India says detention of Hafiz Saeed not enough  [SEP]  NEW DELHI: India on Tuesday said the arrest of the Jamatud Dawa (JuD) chief Hafiz Muhammad Saeed was not enough and demanded Pakistan to take more steps and conduct a "credible crackdown" on militant groups. "Exercises such as yesterday's orders against Hafiz Saeed and others have been carried out by Pakistan in the past also," India's foreign ministry said after the leader of the JuD was placed under "preventative detention" on Monday night. "Only a credible crackdown on the mastermind of the Mumbai terrorist attack and terrorist organisations involved in cross-border terrorism would be proof of Pakistan's sincerity," it added in a statement. The firebrand cleric, who has a $10 million bounty on his head, was taken away by police and escorted to a residence where he now appears to be under house arrest. Four other JuD followers were detained in the same operation. It was unclear why Pakistan chose to take action against the group but authorities have said they were "under obligation to take some action". India says JuD is a front for the militant Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) group, which it accuses of carrying out the attacks on India's financial capital Mumbai in November 2008 which killed more than 160 people. India has long seethed at Pakistan's failure either to hand over or prosecute those accused of planning the Mumbai attacks, while Pakistan said that India failed to give it crucial evidence.

The Latest: Poland withdraws from global migration pact  [SEP]  ROME (AP) — The Latest on migrants and asylum-seekers in Europe (all times local): 5:45 p.m. Greek authorities say two migrants required hospital treatment after being robbed by other residents in an overcrowded camp in… ROME (AP) — The Latest on migrants and asylum-seekers in Europe (all times local): Greek authorities say two migrants required hospital treatment after being robbed by other residents in an overcrowded camp in the north of the country. Police said Tuesday the men, an Iranian and an Iraqi national, suffered stab wounds after being attacked in the Diavata camp for migrants west of Thessaloniki. The camp has prefabricated housing units for 950 people, but the total number of residents is around 1,200, with some migrants sleeping in tents or outbuildings. The victims told police that they were attacked late Monday and robbed of money they had arranged to pay other migrants to secure beds in a prefabricated unit. About 74,000 people seeking asylum live in Greece. Most entered the country illegally from Turkey, hoping to travel on to more affluent European countries. The Polish government says that it will not support a global compact to promote safe and orderly migration, citing national sovereignty as it joins countries including Hungary, Austria and the United States in rejecting it. The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, which won’t be legally binding, was finalized under U.N. auspices in July. It is due to be formally approved at a Dec. 10-11 meeting in Marrakech, Morocco. After a meeting of the Polish Cabinet on Tuesday, the government press office released a statement saying the document fails to meet Poland’s demands for “strong guarantees of the sovereign right to decide who the countries accept in their territory and the distinction between legal and illegal migration.” Italian prosecutors have ordered the seizure of a migrant rescue ship and accused the aid group Doctors Without Borders of illegally disposing of 24 metric tons (26.4 tons) of medical and contaminated waste accumulated during rescues. Catania prosecutors said Tuesday 24 people were under investigation, including the aid group’s Italy personnel and the crew of the Aquarius. In a statement, prosecutors accused them of working with a Sicily-based shipping agency to mix “specialized” waste — including medical equipment and migrants’ clothing — with regular garbage to save money. Prosecutors ordered the immediate sequester of the Aquarius, currently moored in Marseille, as well as of some 460,000 euros ($526,000). Doctors Without Borders called the decision “disproportionate” and another attempt to criminalize migrant rescues, saying its waste disposal followed all “standard procedures.” Copyright © 2018 The Associated Press.

Um, congratulations? Saudi Arabian women now allowed to join the military --  [SEP]  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will now allow women to apply for military service in a historic move. The decision comes as part of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 social program launched by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.Women in governorates including Riyadh, Makkah, al-Qusaim, and al Madina can apply for the rank of soldier, Saudi's General Security division announced in a statement Sunday. Prince Mohammad launched the Vision 2030 initiative to wean the country off its major dependence on oil revenues while also diversifying its economy, which includes expanding economic opportunities for women.In order to become a soldier, however, a woman must fulfill 12 conditions, including: being of Saudi origin, raised in the Kingdom, unless her father had to live abroad because of a 'government-related responsibility.' In addition, applicants must be 25 to 35 years of age, hold at least a high school education, and must pass a mandatory medical check up.Women married to non-Saudis are precluded from applying as is anyone with a criminal record or who was previously employed in any government or military-related institution. An applicant's height must also not be less than 155 centimeters, with a good weight to height ratio.Earlier this month, Eqbal Darandari, a member of the Saudi Shoura Council, called for the conscription of women for a period of at least three months to a year adding that all citizens should be ready to serve their country, reports Al Arabiya When Saudi Arabia's General Directorate of Passports announced 140 jobs open to women, over 107,000 women applied.The Kingdom has witnessed a number of firsts in recent months. Just this week, the General Entertainment Authority announced plans for the construction of the country's first opera house.
UK police arrest medical worker on suspicion of baby murders  [SEP]  British police arrested a female health care worker Tuesday on suspicion of murdering eight babies and trying to kill six others at a hospital neonatal unit in northwestern England. Detectives began investigating the deaths of babies at the Countess of Chester Hospital in Chester more than a year ago, after the hospital reported a higher than expected mortality rate, which it could not explain, on the unit that cares for premature babies and infants needing special care. The hospital asked police to "rule out unnatural causes of death." The investigation initially focused on the deaths of eight babies. Police said Tuesday that the force is now investigating the deaths of 17 babies and 15 "non-fatal collapses" at the unit between March 2015 and July 2016. Cheshire Constabulary said officers arrested a female "health care professional" Tuesday morning on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. The force did not identify the woman or give details of her job. Detective Inspector Paul Hughes said the arrest was a "significant step forward" in a "highly complex and very sensitive investigation." After the spike in deaths the hospital stopped delivering babies before 32 weeks of pregnancy, transferring the expectant mothers to other hospitals. Before police were called in, a review by the Royal College of Pediatrics and Child Health found staffing gaps at the hospital for high-dependency and some intensive care patients but no definitive explanation for the baby deaths. Hospital medical director Ian Harvey said "asking the police to look into this was not something we did lightly, but we need to do everything we can to understand what has happened here and get the answers we and the families so desperately want."

Rugby -Super Rugby round 16  [SEP]  The Queensland Reds snatched a last-minute victory over the ACT Brumbies in an all-Australia Super Rugby clash played out in sodden conditions in Brisbane. Reds flyhalf Quade Cooper made amends for an earlier error by slotting his third penalty for the victory with the last kick of the game after a 71st minute try from replacement back Hamish Stewart had brought the home side back into a tight match. The narrow defeat left the Brumbies level with the Stormers on 34 points in the battle for the third seeding in the playoffs ahead of the South Africans' penultimate match of the season against Japan's Sunwolves on Saturday. The Brumbies, who went ahead with a penalty try and a Kyle Godwin five-pointer soon after half time, also lost flanker Chris Alcock, lock Rory Arnold and winger Aidan Toua to injury.
Philippine troops, suspected militants clash; 6 dead  [SEP]  MANILA, Philippines (AP) — At least six people have been killed in battle between Philippine forces and suspected Abu Sayyaf militants on a central resort island, far from the extremists’ southern jungle bases and in a region where the U.S. government has warned the gunmen may be conducting kidnappings, officials said. The national police chief said a soldier died, and the military chief of staff reported that at least five gunmen were killed in an ongoing gunbattle in Inabanga town in Bohol province. National police chief Director General Ronald dela Rosa said troops and policemen attacked the gunmen early Tuesday in coastal Inabanga, where the gunmen had arrived aboard three boats. The gunmen took cover in three houses as the firefight broke out. The more than 10 militants have either been forced out or killed in the two houses and the others were holed up and surrounded by government forces in the third house, dela Rosa told reporters. If it is proven that the gunmen were from Abu Sayyaf, it may be the group’s first known attempt to carry out ransom kidnappings deep into the heartland of the central Philippines, far from its jungle lairs in the southern provinces of Sulu and Basilan. Abu Sayyaf militants have crossed the sea border with Malaysia on powerful speedboats and kidnapped scores of foreign tourists in past years. “If we were not able to monitor this and engage them with our government forces, it’s a cause for alarm if they were able to carry out kidnappings,” dela Rosa said. Military chief of staff Gen. Eduardo Ano told The Associated Press that military intelligence operatives had been trying to track down the movements of the suspected militants, who first traveled from Sulu to southern Zamboanga peninsula. Intelligence later indicated the gunmen landed ashore in Inabangan, prompting military and police officials to deploy their forces, the official said. The U.S. Embassy recently advised Americans to take precautions amid “unsubstantiated yet credible information” of possible kidnappings by terrorists in Bohol, nearby Cebu province and other central areas. The United States and the Philippines have separately blacklisted the Abu Sayyaf as a terrorist organization for bombings, kidnappings for ransom and beheadings. Some Abu Sayyaf commanders have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group. President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered troops to destroy the extremists in Sulu and in outlying island provinces.
Several injured in shooting at Houston mall  [SEP]  Many have been rushed to hospital, assailant has been shot by police. A troubled lawyer opened fire on morning commuters in Houston on Monday, injuring at least nine people before being fatally shot by police, authorities said. Six victims were taken to hospitals and three were treated at the scene after being shot at while inside their vehicles in the wealthy neighbourhood of West University Place, acting Houston Police Chief Martha Montalvo told reporters. One of the victims was in critical condition and another was in serious condition. Ms. Montalvo declined to identify the suspect but said he was a lawyer and had concerns about his law firm. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, in Cuba on a trip to develop trade relations, told reporters, “The motivation appears to be a lawyer whose relationship with his law firm went bad.” The police bomb squad was securing the suspect’s car, which had numerous weapons in it and police were planning to search his house. Broken glass from shattered car windows littered a parking lot in an upscale shopping center near where the suspect fired 20 to 30 shots. An unidentified woman, standing next to a car with two bullet holes in the windshield, told a local television station she heard “the bullets literally whiz by my window.” Live video streams showed numerous police cars and ambulances in the area. There were also a few vehicles seen with bullet holes
Pope 'begs for God's forgiveness' for sexual abuse scandal  [SEP]  Pope Francis “begged for God’s forgiveness” on Sunday for multiple abuse scandals within the Irish church but faced accusations by a former Vatican official that he had personally ignored allegations against senior clergy. In front of 45,000 supporters at the rain-soaked Knock shrine in the west of Ireland, the pope sought forgiveness over the “open wound” of the church’s sexual abuse scandal and demanded “firm and decisive” measures to find “truth and justice”. At a later Mass to tens of thousands of flag-waving worshippers at Dublin’s Phoenix Park, the showpiece event of the two-day visit to the former Catholic stronghold, he also confessed to other abuses by the Irish church, including at its so-called “mother and baby” homes. But in the city centre around 5,000 abuse victims and their supporters braved the weather to attend the “Stand for Truth” rally. A woman dressed as a nun, with fake blood on her hands, and a man handing out homemade placards reading “the church protects pederasts” were among those protesting. “I think it’s obviously causing quite a lot of distress,” abuse victim and campaigner William Gorry said of the visit. “Healing is something that’s going to take a long, long time if it’s going to happen at all,” he told AFP. The scandal has dogged the visit, and intensified overnight when a former Vatican envoy to the US accused Francis of personally ignoring sexual abuse claims against prominent US cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who was forced to resign last month. Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano wrote in a letter published in the National Catholic Register that he had told Francis of the allegations in 2013, but that he had responded by lifting sanctions imposed on McCarrick by predecessor Pope Benedict. “He (Pope Francis) knew from at least June 23, 2013 that McCarrick was a serial predator,” wrote Vigano,” adding “he knew that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end.” The Vatican said it had no comment to make on the claims. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar on Saturday directly urged the pope to take action against abuses and ensure justice for victims worldwide. “Holy Father, I ask that you use your office and influence to ensure that this is done here in Ireland and across the world,” he said, calling the scandals a “stain” on the church and state. The pope met eight abuse victims on Saturday, including a woman assaulted by a priest when she was in hospital aged 13. Paul Jude Redmond, who was illegally adopted from a Church-run “mother and baby home” because his mother was unmarried, also met the pope. He said the pontiff appeared “genuinely shocked” by the stories of abuse. But at a news conference in Dublin on Saturday by the group Ending Clergy Abuse (ECA), victim Mark Vincent Healey said the pope’s speech in Dublin was a “total missed opportunity”. “We’re still waiting. We’re left with uncertain silence. When is he going to act? What is he going to do?” The pontiff is in Ireland to close the 2018 World Meeting of Families (WMOF) — a global Catholic gathering that addressed issues including the treatment of gay people in the Church. It is the first papal visit to Ireland since John Paul II spoke in front of 1.5 million people during a visit in 1979. The Church’s role and standing has been badly dented by the abuse scandals and the Irish have shed traditional Catholic mores, voting earlier this year to legalise abortion after approving same-sex marriage in 2015. In Tuam, a town in western Ireland not far from Knock, hundreds joined in a silent vigil on Sunday in solidarity with victims of the “mother and baby” homes — institutions accused of being punishment hostels for unwed pregnant women. “Significant quantities” of baby remains found in makeshift graves at the site of one such home in Tuam last year shocked the country. Multiple probes in Ireland have found Church leaders protected hundreds of predatory priests and former Irish president Mary McAleese revealed this month that the Vatican had sought to keep Church documents inaccessible to government investigators. The abuse scandals in Ireland are part of a worldwide crisis for the Vatican. A devastating report earlier this month accused more than 300 priests in the US state of Pennsylvania of abusing more than 1,000 children since the 1950s. The Pope was due to head back to Rome late Sunday.
The Latest: Pakistan PM condemns attack on Chinese Consulate  [SEP]  KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) — The Latest on the attack on the Chinese Consulate in the Pakistani city of Karachi (all times local): Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has "strongly condemned" the attack on the Chinese Consulate in the country's southern port city of Karachi, in which two police officers and all the three assailants were killed. Khan issued a statement, saying he has ordered a probe into Friday's attack. He described the assault as part of a conspiracy against Pakistan and China's economic and strategic cooperation. Pakistani separatists from the southwestern Baluchistan province claimed the consulate attack. Khan vowed in his statement that such incidents would never be able to undermine Pakistan's relations with China, which are "mightier than the Himalayas and deeper than the Arabian Sea." Khan lauded the Karachi police and the paramilitary ranger forces, saying they showed exceptional courage in defending the consulate and that the "nation salutes the martyrs." Pakistani police say a powerful bomb at an open-air food market in the country's northwest has killed at least 12 people, an attack just hours after armed separatists stormed the Chinese Consulate in the southern port city of Karachi. Local police official Tahir Ali says the market attack took place in the town of Klaya, in the Orakzai region of the Khyber Pukhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan. He said most of the victims were minority Shiite Muslims. More than 50 were wounded in the attack, some critically, triggering fears the death toll could rise further, Ali says the tragedy has prompted local authorities to declare an emergency at the region's hospitals to handle the situation. Orakzai has been the scene of militant attacks in recent years, mostly claimed by Pakistani Sunni militants. Pakistan's foreign minister says Pakistani security forces have foiled an attempt by militants to spread terror in attacking the Chinese Consulate in the southern port city of Karachi. Shah Mahmood Quershi described Friday's attack as a "conspiracy" against Pakistan and China, its longtime ally and friend. He blamed the "enemy of Pakistan" for the attack. He told reporters in the capital, Islamabad, that all the Chinese diplomats and staff members have been taken to a "safe place" following the attack. He says he has been in touch with them and that he will phone his Chinese counterpart to inform him in detail about the "successful operation in which Pakistani security forces sacrifices their lives to foil the conspiracy." Pakistani officials say three gunmen who stormed the Chinese Consulate in Pakistan's southern port city of Karachi are dead, after an intense shootout during which two police officers were killed by the attackers. Senior police official Ameer Ahmad Sheikh says all the Chinese diplomats and staff at the consulate were safe and were not harmed during the assault or the shootout onFriday. The Baluch Liberation Army, a separatist group based in the southwestern province of Baluchistan, claimed responsibility for the attack and released photos of the three attackers. Karachi, the capital of southern Sindh province, has a militant presence. Pakistani police say gunmen have stormed the Chinese Consulate in the country's southern port city of Karachi, triggering an intense shootout during which two police officers were killed. Smoke is rising from the building as the shootout continues. Mohammad Ashfaq, a local police chief, says more than two attackers stormed the consulate on Friday. He says security forces have surrounded the area. Local TV shows smoke rising from the building, which is also the residence of Chinese diplomats and other staff. Authorities say the attackers first opened fire at consulate guards and then managed to breach the main gate and enter the building. Ashfaq says security forces are trying to bring the situation under control but the shootout continues. Karachi, the capital of southern Sindh province, has a militant presence.
Two police officers shot and injured in Paris, reports say | Miami Herald  [SEP]  Paris police are warning people to avoid the area around the French capital’s grand Champs-Elysees after reports that two police officers were shot Thursday, with one dying. Many police vehicles can be seen on the avenue that passes many of the city’s most iconic landmarks. A witness identified only as Ines told French television station BFM that she heard a shooting, saw a man’s body on the ground and the area was quickly evacuated by police According to the BBC, the gunman has been killed by police. Paris has been hit with several terrorist attacks in recent years, and police told the Guardian that this latest shooting is “very probably” a terrorist act. CNN reports that one of the officers has been killed, while the other was “seriously injured.” The media outlet also reports the attacker has been “taken down.” Other media outlets are also reporting that the shooter has been shot by police. According to the Guardian, there were at least two attackers involved, and one is dead. Reuters also reports that one officer has been killed. There are also unconfirmed reports of another shooting victim, but it is unclear if that person was a bystander or another attacker. Paris police spokeswoman Johanna Primevert told The Associated Press that the attacker targeted police guarding the area near the Franklin Roosevelt subway station Thursday night at the center of the avenue popular with tourists. The shooting comes three days before the first round of France’s presidential elections. Earlier this week, police in Marseille arrested two men who were allegedly plotting an attack before the election, per Reuters. The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Why Turkey has gone after ISIS in Syria  [SEP]  (CNN) More than 80 ISIS targets were attacked in the first hours of "Operation Euphrates Shield" early Wednesday, officials say, as Turkish armor and warplanes targeted a key ISIS-held town across its border with Syria. Jarablus is one of the few towns in northern Syria that ISIS still controls and is a critical location for supplies, money and fighters coming into ISIS-held areas. In recent months, much of Turkey's firepower has been directed at the Kurdish separatist PKK in southeastern Turkey and across the border in northern Iraq. It has also occasionally shelled ISIS positions in northern Syria, but its last-known airstrikes against ISIS were in November last year. Why is Turkey doing this now? Turkish authorities have been pressed into taking action against ISIS by the surge of suicide bombings in Turkey, as well as the terror group's use of safe houses and "informal" financial services on Turkish soil. "Daesh should be completely cleansed from our borders, and we are ready to do that," Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Tuesday, using an Arabic acronym for ISIS. Ankara may also have calculated that ISIS is especially vulnerable, after many of its remaining fighters fled Manbij, another key stronghold in Syria. The town was liberated by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab forces backed by the United States. ISIS' lines of communication and resupply have now been disrupted and it's taken heavy losses across northern Syria in recent months. But Turkey is anxious that ISIS' vulnerability could provide an opportunity for their "other" enemy in northern Syria -- the Kurdish YPG militia -- who have taken several villages near Jarablus recently. What does Turkey want to achieve? Turkey has several aims. One is to degrade ISIS in this area -- to push the threat it poses away from the Turkish border and make infiltration harder. Beyond that, Turkey wants this part of Syria to become part of its sphere of influence. If it can clear this area of ISIS, it plans to inject Syrian rebel groups that it supports, according to officials. Several hundred are currently massed on the border, according to the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights. The advantage for Turkey in putting its "own" groups into this part of Syria is to stop the Kurdish advance in its tracks. Ankara sees the YPG as a terrorist group indistinguishable from the PKK, which it battles on a daily basis in south-eastern Turkey. The Syrian Kurds have made no secret of their desire to expel ISIS and link the two regions of northern Syria they already control. They would then oversee much of Syria's border with Turkey. Hence the words of Erdogan Wednesday: "Turkey is determined that Syria retains its territorial integrity and will take matters into its own hands if required to protect that unity." How much is Turkey working with coalition partners? "We are working together with the coalition regarding air support," Cavusoglu said Wednesday. In addition, it's likely that the US is providing intelligence and targeting data to Turkish forces using unmanned aerial vehicles from the Incirlik air base. The US has long urged Turkey to become more involved in operations against ISIS in northern Syria, but relations have been strained by the crackdown following the coup attempt in Turkey last month and a surge of anti-US sentiment in Turkey. Cooperating in a substantial effort to weaken ISIS -- just as Vice President Joe Biden arrives in Ankara -- is one way to overcome a troubled few weeks. Additionally, in light of the sudden rapprochement between Erdogan and President Vladimir Putin of Russia, the US wants to reinforce its partnership with Turkey. The US is also sending a message to the Syrian Kurds, its most effective partner on the ground in this region: that American support is not a blank check and that they should not provoke the Turks by moving on Jarablus. Will Turkey will get sucked in further? If the aim of the operation is to expel ISIS from Jarablus and surrounding areas, it's unlikely to be achieved in days. Manbij took weeks to clear, despite a ground offensive and hundreds of US airstrikes. One problem is the risk of substantial civilian casualties. ISIS frequently uses civilians as human shields, preventing them from leaving urban areas, to make targeting more difficult. Perhaps the greatest risk is that this incursion on the ground will spill over into conflict with Kurdish forces. But the Kurds will realize that with their light, outmoded weaponry, they are no match for Turkish tanks. The US is likely encouraging the YPG -- to which it indirectly supplies weapons and training -- to stay out of this. Additionally, Syrian Kurdish sources say they believe Turkey would like nothing better than a pretext to go after the YPG. But if the Kurds don't return to the eastern banks of the Euphrates -- Turkey's "red line" -- the operation against ISIS could evolve into something very different -- perhaps a broader operation that also focuses on the YPG. Turkish public opinion is likely to support this operation, in light of recent attacks blamed on ISIS, so long as its scope and duration is defined. But in Damascus, the Assad regime has bitterly criticized it as a "blatant breach to its sovereignty." The Syrian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that "substituting (ISIS) with other terrorist organizations backed directly by Turkey" is not "fighting terrorism."
US newspapers to Trump: We’re not enemies of the people  [SEP]  US newspapers to Trump: We’re not enemies of the people NEW YORK (AP) — Newspapers from Maine to Hawaii pushed back against President Donald Trump’s attacks on “fake news” Thursday with a coordinated series of editorials speaking up for a free and vigorous press. The Boston Globe, which set the campaign in motion by urging the unified voice, had estimated that some 350 newspapers would participate. They did across the breadth of the country. The Portland (Maine) Press-Herald said a free and independent press is the best defense against tyranny, while the Honolulu Star-Advertiser emphasized democracy’s need for a free press. “The true enemies of the people — and democracy — are those who try to suffocate truth by vilifying and demonizing the messenger,” wrote the Des Moines Register in Iowa. In St. Louis, the Post-Dispatch called journalists “the truest of patriots.” The Chicago Sun-Times said it believed most Americans know that Trump is talking nonsense. The Fayetteville Observer said it hoped Trump would stop, “but we’re not holding our breath.” “Rather, we hope all the president’s supporters will recognize what he’s doing — manipulating reality to get what he wants,” the North Carolina newspaper said. On Thursday morning, Trump again took to Twitter to denounce “fake news.” He wrote: “THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA IS THE OPPOSITION PARTY. It is very bad for our Great Country....BUT WE ARE WINNING!” The Morning News of Savannah, Georgia, said it was a confidant, not an enemy, to the people. “Like any true friend, we don’t always tell you want you want to hear,” the Morning News said. “Our news team presents the happenings and issues in this community through the lens of objectivity. And like any true friend, we refuse to mislead you. Our reporters and editors strive for fairness.” Some newspapers used history lessons to state their case. The Elizabethtown Advocate in Pennsylvania, for instance, compared free press in the United States to such rights promised but not delivered in the former Soviet Union. “If you haven’t already, please subscribe to your local papers,” said the Times, whose opinion section also summarized other editorials across the country. “Praise them when you think they’ve done a good job and criticize them when you think they could do better. We’re all in this together.” That last sentiment made some journalists skittish. Some newspapers, including the Wall Street Journal and the San Francisco Chronicle, wrote editorials explaining why they weren’t joining the Globe’s effort. The Chronicle wrote that one of its most important values is independence, and going along with the crowd went against that. Both the Chronicle and Baltimore Sun said that it plays into the hands of Trump and his supporters who think the media is out to get him. Nolan Finley, columnist and editorial page editor of The Detroit News, spoke up for the press but added a scolding. He said too many journalists are slipping opinion into their news reports, adding commentary and calling it context. “Donald Trump is not responsible for the eroding trust in the media,” Finley wrote. “He lacks the credibility to pull that off. The damage to our standing is self-inflicted.”
10 historic moments in relations between US, North Korea  [SEP]  SINGAPORE (AP) - President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are to meet in Singapore on Tuesday for a summit that will be the first of its kind between leaders of the rival nations. Ten other historic moments in relations between the United States and North Korea: The two countries fought on opposite sides of a three-year war in the early 1950s that killed millions of people, including 36,000 American soldiers. The war began in June 1950 when North Korean troops poured across the border at the 38th parallel and launched a surprise assault. A weak South Korean military was initially almost driven off the peninsula before the American-led U.N. forces pushed the invaders deep into North Korea. The Chinese military later intervened, pushing the U.N. forces back. The fighting ended with an armistice in July 1953. That armistice has yet to be replaced with a peace treaty, leaving the peninsula in a technical state of war. The United States still stations about 28,500 soldiers in South Korea. In January 1968, North Korean navy boats attacked and captured the USS Pueblo off the North’s east coast. One U.S. sailor was killed and 82 others were captured. They were held in North Korea for 11 months, beaten and interrogated before being released after the chief U.S. negotiator signed a statement acknowledging the ship illegally entered the North’s territorial waters. North Korea puts the Pueblo on display in Pyongyang, making it the only U.S. Navy ship held captive by a foreign country. In the summer of 1976, two American soldiers were hacked to death by ax-wielding North Korean soldiers during a fight over U.S. efforts to trim a poplar tree at Demilitarized Zone that bisects the Koreas. An enraged U.S. responded by flying nuclear-capable B-52 bombers toward the DMZ to intimidate North Korea. Rising animosities eased after then-North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of Kim Jong Un, expressed regret over the killing. It remains the most notorious bloodshed at the DMZ, which is strewn with mines and barbed-wire fences. In June 1994, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter travelled to North Korea via the DMZ and had two rounds of lengthy talks with Kim Il Sung in an effort to resolve an early round of nuclear confrontation. After returning to the South, Cater conveyed Kim Il Sung’s offer for an inter-Korean summit and South Korean President Kim Young-sam accepted. What could have been the Koreas’ first summit fizzed, however, after Kim Il Sung died of a heart attack in July 1994. His son Kim Jong Il inherited power, and he held the Koreas’ first summit in 2000 with then South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. In October 1994, the United States signed a landmark nuclear disarmament deal with North Korea, ending months of war fears triggered by the North’s threat to withdraw from the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and convert its stockpile of nuclear fuel into bombs. Under the pact called the “Agreed Framework,” the North froze its atomic activities and agreed to eventually dismantle its nuclear facilities in exchange for the construction of two light-water nuclear reactors for electricity generation and supply of oil. The deal collapsed in 2002, when U.S. officials accused North Korea of covertly running a nuclear program using enriched uranium. In October 2000, Kim Jong Il’s right-hand man and vice marshal, Jo Myong Rok, flew to the United States, becoming the most senior North Korean official to visit its wartime foe since the end of the Korean War. Jo met then-President Bill Clinton and delivered Kim’s personal letter. His trip came as the two countries were seeking to improve ties after a detente was fostered following the first-ever inter-Korean summit earlier that year. A few weeks after Jo’s trip, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made a reciprocal visit to Pyongyang to try to arrange a North Korea visit by Clinton. She met Kim Jong Il and they together watched the “Arirang” mass game spectacle that included a giant mosaic displaying a rocket flying into the sky. The reconciliatory mood between the two countries shifted dramatically after President George W. Bush took office in January 2001 with a tough policy on the North. Clinton eventually went to North Korea as a former president in 2009 to secure the freedom of two detained American journalists held there. The U.S. was brought back to the negotiating table with North Korea in 2003, this time under the framework of six-party talks that also involved South Korea, China, Russia and Japan. During the on-and-off talks that continued until 2008, North Korea halted nuclear activities again and disabled some key elements at its main nuclear complex in return for security, economic and energy benefits. But the talks broke down amid wrangling over how to verify its disarmament steps. North Korea officially pulled out the talks in 2009 to protest international condemnation over a prohibited long-range rocket launch. After taking power after his father Kim Jong Il’s death in late 2011, Kim Jong Un started carrying out an unusually large number of weapons tests as part of his stated objective of building nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching the U.S. mainland. In 2017, especially, the world saw fears of war on the Korean Peninsula escalating dramatically after North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test and three intercontinental ballistic missile test-launches. Kim and Trump traded crude personal insults and warlike threats to attack one another. Kim changed tactics in 2018, sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics in the South and holding a summit with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. Kim has offered to negotiate away his nuclear program if he’s provided with a reliable security guarantee from the United States. There is deep skepticism about whether Kim would fully give up his nukes, but Trump eventually agreed to meet him for a summit. Kim’s top lieutenant and former intelligence chief Kim Yong Chol travelled to the U.S. and with a personal letter to Trump, after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo went to Pyongyang and met the North Korean leader twice.
China targets $3 billion of US goods in tariff spat  [SEP]  The tensions reflect the dueling nationalistic ambitions of Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. U.S. efforts to boost exports of technology-based goods, begun under Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, conflict with China's plan for state-led development of global competitors in fields from robotics to electric cars. Foreign business groups complain Chinese regulators are trying to squeeze them out of promising industries. The Commerce Ministry announcement Friday made no mention of jetliners, soybeans or other products that are the biggest U.S. exports to China by value. That leaves Beijing room to take more drastic steps. Chinese officials are trying to figure out how to address U.S. concerns, said Jake Parker, vice-president for China operations of the U.S.-China Business Council, which represents American companies that do business with China. "Until the Trump administration articulates those concerns and how China can address them, it's going to be very, very difficult for China to make those changes," said Parker. Washington doesn't believe it needs to give Chinese leaders another list of requests because they already know what the United States wants, said a senior U.S. official, who briefed reporters on condition he not be identified further. He said Trump and Xi agreed last year on a 100-day agenda of trade-liberalization measures but Beijing failed to act on about half of them. Instead, the Trump administration wants Chinese leaders to address more basic structural issues that interfere with market forces, said the official. The official cited Beijing's "Made in China 2025" plan as "hugely problematic." It calls for creating Chinese competitors in electric cars, robots, artificial intelligence and other fields. Business groups complain it will hamper or outright block foreign access to those industries. The latest proposed Chinese tariffs would add a 25 per cent charge on pork and aluminum scrap, mirroring Trump's 25 per cent duty on steel, according to the Commerce Ministry. A second list of goods including wine, apples, ethanol and stainless steel pipe would be charged 15 per cent. Chinese purchases of those goods last year totalled $3 billion, the ministry said. The U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs also have irked Japan, America's closest ally in Asia. "We have repeatedly told the U.S. side that steel and aluminum imports from its ally Japan will not adversely affect America's national security, and that Japan should be excluded," said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga. China's top economic official, Premier Li Keqiang, appealed to Washington on Tuesday to "act rationally" and said, "we don't want to see a trade war." The United States buys little Chinese steel or aluminum, but analysts have said Beijing would feel obligated to take action to avoid looking weak. Beijing reported a trade surplus of $275.8 billion with the United States last year, or two-thirds of its global total. Washington reports different figures that put the gap at a record $375.2 billion. Trump's technology order is in response to "unfair and harmful acquisition of U.S. technology," said a statement by the U.S. Trade Representative's office. It said USTR would pursue a World Trade Organization case against Beijing's "discriminatory technology licensing." A USTR statement said possible measures include a 25 per cent tariff on Chinese-made aerospace, computer and information technology and machinery but gave no details. China is unlikely to respond until Washington acts but might launch an investigation of imports of U.S. corn and soybeans "as a warning shot," said Parker. He noted Beijing began a probe of U.S. sorghum in February after Trump announced the steel and aluminum tariffs. On Tuesday, the Chinese premier promised at a news conference Beijing will "open even wider" to imports and investment as part of efforts to make its state-dominated economy more productive. Li said Beijing would "fully open" manufacturing, with "no mandatory requirement for technology transfers." However, Chinese officials already insist companies aren't required to hand over technology, so it was unclear how policy might change. By Joe McDonald, The Associated Press
Somalia pirates: Anger fuels return of ship attacks  [SEP]  Locals say pirate attacks will continue and blame the government in Puntland for granting foreigners fishing permits. A volatile buildup of weapons and resentment along the northern Somali coast culminated in the hijack of an oil freighter this week, the first such seizure by Somali pirates since 2012, experts and locals say. Gunmen hijacked the Aris 13, a small oil tanker, on Monday and are demanding a ransom to release the ship and its eight Sri Lankan crew, the EU Naval Force that patrols the waters off Somalia said on Wednesday. Now shipping companies are scrambling to find out whether the attack is a one-off, or whether pirates could once again threaten one of the world's most important shipping lanes and cost the industry billions of dollars annually. The other side of Somalia's pirates Somali forces have been sent to try to free the tanker. But locals say the attacks will continue and blame their government in the semi-autonomous Puntland region for granting foreigners permits to fish in Somali waters. "Since the fish are drained by foreigners, my colleagues plan to go into the ocean to hijack other ships. We have no government to speak on our behalf," said fisherman Mohamed Ismail. Although Somalia remains mired in violence and poverty, the Horn of Africa nation has shown some small signs of progress in recent years despite a civil war lasting more than a quarter of a century. A return to piracy could derail those fragile gains. Monday's hijack followed a long hiatus in pirate attacks, with only four unsuccessful attempts in the past three years. The lull encouraged foreign fishing vessels to return to Somali waters, locals told Reuters news agency, fuelling resentment. "If you look at the sea at night, there are so many lights out there [from fishing vessels]. It looks like New York," complained one former Somali official who asked not to be named. The final straw, he said, was when seven Thai fishing vessels docked at Bosasso port last month. The ships paid the local government more than $672,000 for fishing licences, a government contract showed. The move infuriated locals who felt they would see neither fish nor the cash. "When I saw those ships come into Bosasso port in broad daylight, I knew there would be an attack," he said. "The fishermen became desperate." Only 14 foreign vessels are licensed to fish, including the seven Thai vessels, the Puntland government said. All others are illegal, said Ali Hirsi Salaad, director of Puntland's Ministry of Fishing. "Fisherman are right to complain," he said. Matt Bryden, the head of Nairobi-based think-tank Sahan Research, said coastal communities were rearming amid widespread anger at the failure to crack down on foreign fishing vessels. He displayed several photographs he said were of a recent shipment of assault weapons, saying that so many were arriving that in one area the price of a PKM machine gun had fallen from $13,000 in October to about $8,500 last month. "The price is going down because so many are being imported," he said. The same source sent him a photo of the sea's horizon at night, he said. The lights of at least 23 vessels that the man said were fishing boats glowed on the horizon. "Coastal communities are angry at the foreign vessels and at the authorities who they believe have licensed some of them," he said. A Bosasso-based weapons dealer said orders for rocket propelled grenades, machine guns, and ammunition had increased. Jonah Leff, a weapons tracing expert with conflict Armament Research, said many pirates had turned to smuggling. They take boatloads of people to Yemen and return with weapons, he said. "There's been an influx of weapons," he said.
Kurdish YPG says  [SEP]  BEIRUT, June 3 (Reuters) - A U.S.-backed operation by Syrian forces to capture Islamic State's Syrian "capital" of Raqqa will start in the next "few days", the spokesman for the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia said on Saturday. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias backed by the U.S.-led coalition, has been encircling Raqqa since November in a multi-phased campaign to drive Islamic State from the city where it has planned attacks on the West. The assault on Raqqa will pile more pressure on Islamic State's self-declared "caliphate" with the group facing defeat in the Iraqi city of Mosul and being forced into retreat across much of Syria, where Deir al-Zor is its last major foothold. "The forces reached the outskirts of the city, and the major operation will start ... in the coming few days," YPG spokesman Nouri Mahmoud told Reuters by phone. He was confirming a report citing the spokeswoman for the Raqqa campaign, Jihan Sheikh Ahmed, as indicating a new phase to storm Raqqa would start in the "coming few days". The remarks made in an interview with a local media outlet were circulated by an SDF-run Whatsapp group. A spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State said it would not comment on the timeline for the next phase of operations to retake the Syrian city, located on the River Euphrates some 90 km (56 miles) from the Turkish border. The spokesman, Colonel Ryan Dillon, said the SDF were "advancing closer and closer every day", having moved to within 3 km (less than two miles) of Raqqa to the north and east. To the west, the SDF were less than 10 km (six miles) away, he said in an email interview. The United States said on Tuesday it had started distributing arms to the YPG to help take Raqqa, part of a plan that has angered NATO-ally Turkey, which is worried by growing Kurdish influence in northern Syria. Turkey views the YPG as the Syrian extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has fought an insurgency in southeast Turkey since 1984 and is considered a terrorist group by the United States, Turkey and Europe. The U.S.-led coalition has said some 3,000 to 4,000 Islamic State fighters are thought to be holed up in Raqqa city, where they have erected defences against the anticipated assault. The U.S.-led coalition has provided air support and special forces to help the SDF operations near Raqqa. "The battle will not be easy," Mahmoud said. "Of course (IS) has tunnels, mines, car bombs, suicide bombers, and at the same time it is using civilians as human shields." Once Raqqa falls, Deir al-Zor province in eastern Syria will be Islamic State's last major foothold in Syria and Iraq. "Daesh will resist because Raqqa is its capital and if Raqqa goes that means the entire caliphate is gone," Mahmoud said. (Reporting by Tom Perry; Editing by Helen Popper)

Pope Francis removes two scandal-hit cardinals from his inner circle  [SEP]  POPE FRANCIS HAS removed two prominent cardinals from his inner circle months after they were tainted by paedophile scandals and ahead of a Church-wide meeting on the “protection of minors” next year. Australian Cardinal George Pell and Chilean Cardinal Francisco Javier Errazuriz were both removed from the so-called C9 Council of Cardinals, an international advice body set up by Francis himself, the Vatican said today. The last time the C9 met in September, Errazuriz, who is accused of ignoring reports of abuse in Chile, and Pell, who faces charges in Australia related to historical child sexual offences, were both absent, and the council said it was considering restructuring. Despite being removed from the C9, Pell, 77, remains in charge of Vatican finances, the third most powerful position in the Roman Catholic Church. The Church has been hit by a series of child abuse scandals in recent years, with widespread allegations of cover-ups, including against the pope himself. The pope clarified the composition of the C9 ahead of a February meeting with leaders of bishops’ conferences from around the world dealing with the “protection of minors”, to which victims of priest sex abuse have been invited. Cardinal George Pell departing the Melbourne Magistrates Court in Melbourne, May 2018. Source: AAP/PA Images The meeting of bishops from around the world will also have to deal with some Asian and African bishops conferences who say they are not concerned by the “Western” abuse problem. “February’s meeting can’t resolve all the problems, because there’s too much world diversity in the Church. The American (US) episcopacy is panicking, they want to be as radical (against sexual abuse) as possible, while Africans don’t want any measures taken,” said a source close to the pope. “A code of silence has been our culture for too long, February’s meeting should mark a new beginning for bishops’ responsibility, or even for a new control system,” the source said. Allegations in August from a conservative archbishop that the pope had ignored abuse suspicions concerning a prominent US cardinal have triggered an internal investigation into Vatican archives ordered by Pope Francis. They also confirmed a rift in the Church between some ultra-conservative Catholics and a pope they see as a dangerous progressive interested in social issues to the detriment of Church doctrine. The Church was also rocked in August by a devastating US report on child sex abuse which accused more than 300 “predator” priests of abusing more than 1,000 minors over seven decades in the state of Pennsylvania. The commission set up by Francis has said that the fight against abuse must be a Church priority and emphasised the importance of listening to victims. While Pell faces prosecution in Australia, he is also up for renewal in February as the Vatican’s finance chief. Francis has in the past preferred to give the accused the presumption of innocence and has therefore not named anyone to replace Pell, despite a senior Vatican official saying this week that Church expenses were growing “unacceptably”. Chilean Cardinal Errazuriz appears at the very least to have given Francis bad advice. The pope’s mistaken defence of a Chilean bishop accused of covering up for an old paedophile priest overshadowed his trip to the South American country in January and heaped embarrassment on the Church. Errazuriz, 85, met Francis last month and subsequently announced his “withdrawal” from the C9. A third cardinal, Democratic Republic of Congo’s Laurent Monsengwo, will also no longer attend C9 meetings, effectively reducing the body to a “C6″. Monsengwo, 79, has for years played an important political as well as spiritual role in the war-torn African nation, but recently gave up his position as archbishop of Kinshasa. Comments have been closed for legal reasons.
Jacob Wetterling suspect Danny Heinrich appearing in court t...  [SEP]  MINNEAPOLIS -- Danny Heinrich, the man who led authorities to the remains of Jacob Wetterling, is expected to appear in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis at 1 p.m. Tuesday, Sept. 6. A status conference in the child-pornography case against Heinich, 53, of Annandale, is set before Chief Judge John Tunheim. Heinrich has been charged with 25 counts of possessing and receiving child pornography; he pleaded not guilty to those charges in February and is to go to trial in October. Heinrich last year was named as a “person of interest” in the abduction of Jacob Wetterling, the 11-year-old St. Joseph boy who was abducted from a rural road near his house on Oct. 22, 1989, and never seen again. Heinrich has not been charged in that case, but authorities last summer searched his house for ties to the boy’s disappearance. Heinrich had been under increasing scrutiny as authorities have revisited Jacob’s abduction and investigated a string of sexual assaults on preteen and teen boys near Paynesville in the mid- to late 1980s; Jacob was taken less than a mile from his home in St. Joseph, which is about 20 miles from Paynesville. Heinrich lived in Paynesville with his father at the time of the abduction. Last Wednesday, Heinrich led a team of FBI agents and state and county investigators to a pasture near Paynesville where Wetterling’s skeletal remains were buried, according to a source with direct knowledge of the search. Investigators revisited the site again Friday for crime-scene purposes. The Stearns County Sheriff’s Office said Jacob’s remains were identified Saturday. Authorities expect to provide more details this week.
Forty-nine killed during Nepal plane crash landing  [SEP]  KATHMANDU, Nepal - A plane crash at Nepal's main airport killed 49 people among the 71 on board, police said Tuesday, after a recording indicated confusion over the landing direction before the plane, flying low and erratically, struck the ground and erupted in flames. The pilot did not follow the control tower's instructions and approached the airport's one runway from the wrong direction, the Kathmandu airport's general manager said. "The airplane was not properly aligned with the runway. The tower repeatedly asked if the pilot was OK and the reply was 'yes,"' Raj Kumar Chetri said. But the conversations between the pilot and air traffic controllers indicated confusion over which direction the plane should land. In the recording posted by air traffic monitoring website liveatc.net, conversation veers repeatedly about whether the pilot should land from the south or the north. Just before landing the pilot asks "Are we cleared to land?" Moments later, the controller comes back on, using a tone rarely heard in such conversations - perhaps even panic - and tells the pilot: "I say again, turn!" Seconds later, the controller orders fire trucks onto the runway. US-Bangla Airlines flight BS211 from Dhaka to Kathmandu was carrying 67 passengers and four crew members. Police spokesman Manoj Neupane said Tuesday that 49 people were confirmed to have been killed and 22 injured. They were being treated in several hospitals in Nepal's capital. Autopsies would be done at the Teaching Hospital morgue. The government has ordered an investigation into the crash. A statement from the prime minister's office said the six-member team headed by a former government secretary will gather the facts to determine the cause and prevent future crashes. The plane had circled Tribhuvan International Airport twice as it waited for clearance to land, Mohammed Selim, the airline's manager in Kathmandu, told Dhaka-based Somoy TV by telephone.
Egypt President Declares State of Emergency - Jewish Community News  [SEP]  Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi has declared a state of emergency for three months after two suicide bombings killed scores of Christians in two church attacks on Sunday. El-Sissi accused countries he didn’t name of fueling instability in Egypt, saying that “Egyptians have foiled plots and efforts by countries and fascist, terrorist organizations that tried to control Egypt.” The army chief-turned-president hasn’t detailed the legal measures needed to declare the state of emergency, but according to the Egyptian constitution, the parliament majority must vote in favor of the state of emergency. Egypt declared a state of emergency in the months that followed the military ouster of the Islamist President Mohammed Morsi when his supporters staged mass demonstrations that descended into violence.
Countries have no right to recognize Jerusalem as Israeli capital  [SEP]  “Jerusalem [al-Quds] should remain as it is now and not the capital of Israel,” Mahathir told Reuters on the sidelines of an event in Bangkok, adding, “Jerusalem [al-Quds] has always been under Palestine, so why are they taking the initiative to divide it not belonging to them, but to divide the Arabs and the Jews? They have no rights.” "Australia now recognizes West Jerusalem, being the seat of the Knesset and many of the institutions of government, is the capital of Israel," Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Saturday, adding that it will not move its embassy from Tel Aviv until a "peace" settlement is reached. Israel occupied Jerusalem al-Quds in 1967 in a move never recognized by the international community. The Palestinians want the city as the capital of their future state. Tensions have been running high in the occupied Palestinian territories and the Gaza Strip since December 2017, when US President Donald Trump decided to recognize Jerusalem al-Quds as Israel’s “capital” and relocate Washington’s embassy from Tel Aviv to the occupied city. On December 21 last year, the United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly voted in favor of a resolution that calls on the US to withdraw its controversial policy shift.
Gambian activists urge justice as President Yahya Jammeh finally cedes power  [SEP]  As Gambia’s defeated authoritarian ruler prepares to leave the country, human rights activists demand that he be held accountable for alleged abuses. Yahya Jammeh announced early Saturday he will cede power, after hours of last-ditch talks with regional leaders and the threat that a regional military force would forcibly remove him. Watch what else is making news: No date has been set for the return of Gambian President Adama Barrow, who beat Jammeh in last month’s election and who was sworn into office Thursday in neighboring Senegal, where he was for his safety. “The rule of fear” in Gambia had ended with Jammeh’s rule, said Barrow late Friday. Jammeh, who once vowed to rule for a billion years, could leave Gambia Saturday but may stay on for three days, according to those close to the negotiations mediated by Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz and Guinean President Alpha Conde. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to speak about the situation to the press. Jammeh’s agreement to step down brought an end to the political crisis in this tiny West African nation of 1.9 million, that attracts British and European tourists to its tropical weather and Atlantic beaches, promoted as “the Smiling Coast.” Gambian human rights activists are insisting that Jammeh be held accountable for alleged human rights abuses during his 22-year rule and that he not be able to keep funds illegally amassed. “Jammeh came as a pauper bearing guns. He should leave as a disrobed despot. The properties he seeks to protect belong to Gambians and Gambia and he must not be allowed to take them with him. He must leave our country without conditionalities,” said Jeggan Bahoum of the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy in Gambia. An online petition urged that Jammeh not be granted asylum and should instead be arrested for alleged human rights abuses. Famously mercurial Jammeh initially shocked Gambians by conceding his election loss to Barrow in December. But after human rights activists demanded his arrest for alleged abuses, Jammeh refused to accept his defeat and refused to leave power. Jammeh, who first seized power in a 1994 coup, has been holed up this week in his official residence in Banjul, increasingly isolated as he was abandoned by his security forces and several Cabinet members. The West African regional bloc, ECOWAS, pledged to remove Jammeh by force if he did not step down. The group assembled a multinational military force including tanks that rolled into Gambia Thursday. The force included troops from Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria, Togo and Mali, and they moved in after Barrow’s inauguration and a unanimous vote by the UN Security Council supporting the regional efforts. Fearing violence, about 45,000 people have fled Gambia for Senegal, according to the UN refugee agency. After days of uncertainty, Banjul was peaceful Saturday with life slowly returning to normal, although many shops remained closed. Jammeh’s announcement to relinquish power is a good first step, said Jeffrey Smith, executive director of Vanguard Africa. “For the Gambia to truly move on, President Barrow must reside in state house and begin the task of governing. In an ideal scenario, Jammeh will also face justice for the many crimes he has committed since 1994,” wrote Smith by email. “From the outset, ECOWAS played a proactive role in the Gambia, and I think their leadership should be applauded. The successful outcome represents an important precedent and hopefully builds momentum towards a more robust defense of democracy in the region and beyond.”
Afghanistan: US service members killed in bomb explosion  [SEP]  Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption US forces serving with Nato have been training Afghan forces since combat operations ended in 2014 Three US service members have been killed and three others wounded in an explosion near Ghazni in Afghanistan. A US civilian contractor was also hurt by the improvised explosive device, the Nato-led mission said in a statement. Officials would not give further detail until next of kin were notified, saying only that the injured were evacuated and receiving medical treatment. Taliban militants said they carried out the attack, their latest near the strategic city south of the capital. On Saturday, a US soldier was killed in Nimroz province in what appeared to be an accidental shooting, the Nato-led mission also announced on Tuesday. On 3 November, Utah mayor Brent Taylor was killed in an apparent insider attack while serving with the US Army National Guard to train Afghan security forces. Earlier this month, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said more than 28,000 Afghan police and soldiers had been killed since 2015. For the past year, US and Afghan officials had withheld such information as it was deemed too sensitive, reported the New York Times. In October, a local police chief was killed when a bodyguard opened fire on a group of US and Afghan officials in the southern Kandahar province. US General Scott Miller escaped unhurt in that attack, which was later claimed by the Taliban. A total of 13 US troops have been killed this year in Afghanistan, according to the Defense Post publication. Why are US troops in Afghanistan? American-led combat operations against the Taliban officially ended in 2014, but some US troops remain in the country to provide training and assistance to Afghan forces, which do most of the fighting. The Taliban's power and reach has surged since then - and the number of security personnel being killed has soared. Last year, US President Donald Trump signalled he would keep US boots on the ground indefinitely amid concerns that the Taliban was gaining ground. The US forces are part of the Nato-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, which has more than 16,000 personnel.
The science behind Cyclone Debbie  [SEP]  TROPICAL cyclone Debbie made landfall in Queensland as a category 4 cyclone with winds of more than 150kmh. The cyclone crossed the coast near Airlie Beach Tuesday afternoon. Reports of wind gusts in excess of 250km per hour and rainfall of hundreds of millimetres have been made in some areas along the central Queensland coast. Anomalously high moisture, warm ocean temperatures, and low environmental pressures seem to have created the conditions that allowed TC Debbie to form and grow in intensity. Tropical cyclones are low pressure systems that form over warm tropical oceans. The warmth and moisture of the oceans are what gives a cyclone its energy. The low pressure, which meteorologists measure in "hectopascals”, draws in the surrounding warm, moist air, which then rises into deep thunderstorm clouds. As the air is pulled into the centre of low pressure, Earth's rotation causes it to spin cyclonically and it continues to intensify. TC Debbie formed at the eastern end of an active monsoon trough extending from the Indian Ocean across the top of Australia and into the Coral Sea. On March 22, a large region of active thunderstorms began to organise into a weather disturbance off the eastern tip of Papua New Guinea. Over the following two days the thunderstorms organised about a circulation centre as sea level pressures began to drop and moist air converged into the area. By late on March 24 a tropical depression, a forerunner of a cyclone, had formed and begun to drift south, making a long S-shaped track. Tropical Cyclone Debbie was named on March 25. It then came under the influence of the subtropical ridge, a zone of stable high pressure that gives much of Australia's fine weather during the summer. This drove Debbie west-southwest towards the Queensland coast while it gradually intensified. Because of the relatively high amounts of moisture in the atmosphere, and relatively warm ocean waters, Debbie intensified to category 4 by 10 pm on March 27, with the strongest wind gusts reaching 225-280km per hour. On Tuesday afternoon Debbie was a strong category 4 cyclone with a central pressure of 943 hectopascals and surface sustained winds of 185 kilometres per hour. The Bureau of Meteorology downgraded TC Debbie to a category 3 at 4:00 pm EST. To put Debbie in context, there has been only one cyclone since 1980 to have made landfall in Queensland with a lower central pressure. That was Yasi in 2011.
NIH collaboration helps advance potential Zika treatments  [SEP]  Washington, DC - Researchers at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) recently identified compounds that potentially can be used to inhibit Zika virus replication and reduce its ability to kill brain cells. These compounds now can be studied by the broader research community to help combat the Zika public health crisis. NCATS is part of the National Institutes of Health. Using NCATS’ drug repurposing screening robots, researchers identified two classes of compounds effective against Zika: one is antiviral, and the other prevents Zika-related brain cell death. The compounds include emricasan, an investigational drug currently being evaluated in a clinical trial to reduce liver injury and fibrosis, and niclosamide, a U. S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for use in humans to treat worm infections. In addition, the researchers identified nine cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. CDK usually is involved in regulation of cellular processes as well as normal brain development, but the Zika virus can negatively affect this process. NCATS’ work was a collaborative effort with Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, (JHU) and Florida State University, Tallahassee, (FSU), and the study results were published in the August 29 issue of Nature Medicine. The NCATS screening effort builds on the initial research by JHU and FSU scientists, who discovered that the Zika virus infects brain cells early in development. Infection by the Zika virus may be related to fetal microcephaly, an abnormally small head resulting from an underdeveloped and/or damaged brain. The Zika virus has been reported in 60 countries and territories worldwide; currently, there are no vaccines or effective drug treatments. The virus is spread primarily through bites from infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, and in addition, can be transmitted from mother to child and through sexual contact. It also is associated with neurological diseases such as Guillain-Barré syndrome in infected adults. “The Zika virus poses a global health threat,” said Anton Simeonov, Ph.D., NCATS scientific director. “While we await the development of effective vaccines, which can take a significant amount of time, our identification of repurposed small molecule compounds may accelerate the translational process of finding a potential therapy.” NCATS researcher Wei Zheng, Ph.D., and his team led the drug repurposing screen to test three strains of Zika: Asian, African and Puerto Rican. The scientists first developed an assay (test) using caspase 3, a protein that causes brain cell death when infected by the virus. The next step was screening 6,000 FDA-approved and investigational compounds, which resulted in the identification of more than 100 promising compounds. The team then evaluated the protective effect of these compounds in brain cells after Zika virus infection. Three lead compounds, emiracsan, niclosamide and a CDK inhibitor known as PHA-690509, were identified as reducing neuronal cell death caused by Zika virus infection. These compounds were effective either in inhibiting the replication of Zika or in preventing the virus from killing brain cells. For example, emricasan prevents cell death, and niclosamide and the nine CDK inhibitors stop the virus’ replication. The team also found that emricasan, when combined with one of the CDK inhibitors, prevented both cell death and virus replication. In addition, the team noted that the CDK inhibitors may be useful in treating non-pregnant patients who face an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome and other conditions sparked by Zika infection. The researchers cautioned, however, that the use of emricasan and niclosamide during pregnancy for Zika infection will need to be evaluated in pre-clinical toxicology studies and clinical trials. “Using the NCATS drug repurposing platform for emerging infectious diseases can help rapidly identify potential treatments for urgent needs such as the Zika virus,” Zheng said. “While identifying promising compounds is a first step, our goal at NCATS is to facilitate the translation of these findings for evaluation in the clinic. The release of all the compound screening data in this publication and in the public PubChem database opens the door to the research community to do just that.” NCATS’ screening effort enabled the broader research team to quickly translate their earlier discoveries toward work to develop treatments for Zika virus infection. JHU is working on a mouse model to study the neuroprotective effects of the compounds identified from the screen and studying the mechanism of action of the lead compounds. FSU is testing the efficacy of these compounds in a Zika virus mouse model and is also studying the mechanism of action of the lead compounds. In addition to NCATS, FSU and JHU, the research was supported by Emory University, Atlanta; the Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund, Columbia; NIH’s National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke through grants NS048271 and NS095348, NS047344 and NS097206; and NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases through grant AI119530.
Cyprus President Anastasiades Beats Leftist Challenger, Wins Another 5-Year Term  [SEP]  Incumbent Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades defeated leftist challenger Stavros Malas and won another five-year term in a run-off election on Sunday. The 71-year-old conservative won 55.9 percent of the vote with 95 percent of votes counted. Malas conceded an hour after the polls closed, Reuters reported. Malas, a 50-year-old geneticist who served as the republic's health minister in the former left-wing administration, had also come ran against Anastasiades in 2013. But the suspense was tight. The office of the president of Cyprus is elected using a two-round voting system, and a first round saw Anastasiades win an inconclusive 34 percent of the vote and Malas win an unexpected 29 percent percent of the vote. With all second round votes counted, Anastasiades won 56 percent of the vote against Malas' 44 percent. The island in the Mediterranean has been divided since 1974, when "Turkish troops invaded following a Greek-backed coup," as NPR's Michele Kelemen has reported. The Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot communities are separated by a U.N. buffer zone, and "many attempts to reunite the island have failed." The vote took place barely seven months after the latest round of peace talks ended abruptly. Anastasiades steered the Cyprus' economy to recovery after a 2013 financial crisis, and has pledged to seek the resumption of U.N.-mediated peace talks. "A new era begins tomorrow," Anastasiades told supporters outside of his election campaign headquarters, reported Al Jazeera. "People demand cooperation and unity because this is the only way to solve the problems we're facing."

Here’s a blank one you can use for your guide to an 2017 NCAA Championship journey.
Jammeh’s Wife, Children Reportedly Flee Gambia  [SEP]  Yahya Jammeh’s wife of 17 years, Zeinab Suma Jammeh, and his children have reportedly fled The Gambia as regional forces threatened to forcefully evict the 51-year-old from office. The Economic Community of West Africa States and the African Union to quit power had threatened to stepped in if Jammeh did not handover power to Adama Barrow, the acclaimed winner of December 9, 2016 elections. Gambians and tourists were also leaving in droves. Bus parks were scenes of chaos as people boarded buses, packing suitcases onto trucks and hiring canoes to flee the capital of Banjul, as President Yahya Jammeh clung to power on the eve of his rival Barrow’s planned swearing in. The Banjul airport was also chaotic as many people struggled to board planes to fly out of the country Jammeh, a former soldier who once vowed to rule for “a billion years”, is refusing to step down, despite condemnation from regional leaders and threat of an imminent invasion by West African troops to enforce his election defeat. The parliament instead extended his tenure by three months, a day after it passed a state of emergency law for the same period. Residents in two Senegalese border towns reported heavy troop movements towards the frontier and a Senegalese military source confirmed the build up. At least eight ministers have so far resigned and it is unclear how many of his own armed forces will be willing to defend him once his mandate expires. But many Gambians are not waiting to find out. At the sandy Bundung Garage bus station in the capital, Banjul, women carrying infants strapped to their backs queued up to get the belongings they had salvaged onto buses bound for the southern border with Senegal. Men and children sat patiently amid piles of suitcases, rolled up foam mattresses, bags of rice, bottles of cooking oil. “The last three days we’ve been submerged,” said bus park manager Sonore Momodou Choi, his face shaded from the blazing sun by a fishing hat. “Normally we load three minibuses per day. This week we’re 25 a day, not including the bigger buses.” Jammeh declared a state of emergency on Tuesday, but a Banjul-based diplomat said it wasn’t clear what extra powers this would give his forces or if the president even had the authority to enforce it. Others fled on pirogues across the river that splits Africa’s smallest country down the middle. In Zinguinchor, in Senegal’s Casamance region south of Gambia, a Reuters witness saw 12 children crammed in the back of a van on a beach less a few hundred metres from the Gambian border next to a heap of belongings in plastic bags. “We were scared by what we saw on the news,” explained 14 year old Moussa Camara from Kafotang in Gambia. He crossed over in a pirogue with 27 other family members on Tuesday. At least 26,000 people have fled Gambia to Senegal fearing unrest, the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) said on Wednesday, citing Senegalese government figures.
20 dead in road accidents in Russia; 14 as bus catches fire  [SEP]  MOSCOW (AP) - Russian officials say at least 14 people have been killed after a bus caught fire following a nighttime collision with a truck that was being towed and six other people have been killed in separate road accidents. The bus crash took place early Sunday in Russia's central Tatarstan Republic. Footage from the scene showed the burnt-out shell of the bus. Russian investigators said a criminal case has been opened. In other deadly road accidents, four people died early Sunday after a car hit a tree near the city of Nizhny Novgorod, east of Moscow, and two teenagers were killed late Saturday when a truck plowed into a bus stop in the western Russian city of Bryansk.

Trump announces plans for Pentagon to create ‘Space Force'  [SEP]  WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump announced Monday he is directing the Pentagon to create a new “Space Force” as an independent military service branch aimed at ensuring American supremacy in space — though he may have limited power to develop a new military command. While Trump has previously talked about his desire for a space unit, he seemed to take those musings one step further, specifically ordering the Pentagon to begin the creation of a sixth branch of the American armed forces. “When it comes to defending America, it is not enough to merely have an American presence in space. We must have American dominance in space,” Trump said during remarks at the White House. “We are going to have the Air Force and we are going to have the Space Force, separate but equal.” Turning to seek out Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Trump said, “General Dunford, if you would carry that assignment out, I would be very greatly honored also ...Where’s General Dunford? General? Got it?” Dunford appeared to acknowledge the order, responding, “we got it.” But the directive seemed to take defense officials by surprise. Creating a new joint military command is largely the purview of Congress, which would have to provide the authority and any funding or shifting of money to a new unit. Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White said that the department understands the president’s guidance, and is working on the matter while taking into consideration the implications for intelligence operations for the other services. “Working with Congress, this will be a deliberate process with a great deal of input from multiple stakeholders,” she said. A senior congressional aide said that Trump’s order is consistent with efforts by members of Congress over the past two years to find a way to dedicate additional resources to the country’s warfighting in space. But the issue has been contested, and even Defense Secretary Jim Mattis expressed some early reluctance to creating a new military service citing the expense and broader effort to integrate warfighting. The Defense Department is already in the middle of a congressionally-mandated review of the space force issue. The study began in March, with an interim review due in August and a final report due December 31. It’s not clear if the president’s comments Monday were meant to override or influence that study. Decades ago, the military deemed space a critical war-fighting domain, creating the Colorado-based Air Force Space Command in 1982. It includes more than 36,000 personnel around the world that provide space and cyber capabilities for the Defense Department. And the Space and Missile Systems Center at Los Angeles Air Force Base in California, designs and buys most of the Pentagon’s space systems, while also overseeing satellite and other aircraft launches. In addition, a number of federal defense agencies control portions of the space program, including NASA and the National Reconnaissance Office, which develops and operates surveillance spacecraft and satellites for intelligence gathering. In a March document outlining the review, the Pentagon said it has already made organizational changes to beef up the stature of the space force, but is reviewing others. The document sent to Congress said the review will look at research, capabilities, acquisition and joint warfighting needs, and will assess “whether the Space Corps concept should be implemented.” The establishment of an independent space force was mentioned by Trump in a March speech to service members in California, but it has faced opposition since it could create an expensive new headquarters bureaucracy and trigger complex and divisive battles between the agencies that currently control part of the space mission. So far, the Pentagon doesn’t have any cost estimates for the development of a new command, or any description of how it would be set up or its impact on other defense and intelligence agencies. Ever since the Space Age started with the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik, there has been a military and national security aspect to space, even though there are treaties and a United Nations committee that explicitly talk about keeping space a place of peace. In the 1950s, President Dwight Eisenhower established two separate space programs — a civilian one that became NASA, and a military one. Trump more broadly envisioned a bright future for the U.S. space program, pledging to revive the country’s flagging efforts, return to the moon and eventually send a human mission that would reach Mars. The president framed space as a national security issue, saying he does not want “China and Russia and other countries leading us.” While the U.S. has dominated in space since the 1969 moon landing, China is making strong headway, while Russia is in decline. “My administration is reclaiming America’s heritage as the world’s greatest spacefaring nation,” Trump said in the East Room, joined by members of his space council. “The essence of the American character is to explore new horizons and to tame new frontiers.” The president also used the White House event to establish a new policy for reducing satellite clutter in space. The policy calls for providing a safe and secure environment up in orbit, as satellite traffic increases. It also sets up new guidelines for satellite design and operation, to avoid collisions and spacecraft breakups. The council’s executive secretary, Scott Pace, told reporters before the meeting that space is becoming increasingly congested and current guidelines are inadequate to address the challenge. Trump also encouraged SpaceX, Blue Origin and other nontraditional aerospace companies led by wealthy U.S. entrepreneurs to beat NASA to Mars. “Just go ahead, if you beat us to Mars, we’ll be very happy, and you’ll be even more famous,” he said. “As long as it’s an American rich person, that’s good, OK? They can beat us. We’ll save a little money, and they can beat us, and we’re taking full credit for it, don’t worry about it.” Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Last straw for McDonald’s, Burger King in Mumbai plastic ban | Malay Mail  [SEP]  MUMBAI, June 26 — Burger King, McDonald’s and Starbucks are among dozens of companies fined for violating a new ban on single-use plastics in India’s commercial capital Mumbai, an official said today. The rules, in force since Saturday, prohibit the use of disposable plastic items such as bags, cutlery, cups and bottles under a certain size. Businesses and residents face fines of between 5,000 rupees (approx. RM294) for a first-time offence to 25,000 rupees (approx. RM1,477) or even three months in jail for repeat offending. Some 250 officials, wearing blue uniforms and dubbed Mumbai’s “anti-plastic squad”, have been deployed to carry out inspections of restaurants and shops across the teeming coastal city of 20 million. Nidhi Choudhari, a deputy municipal commissioner in charge of enforcing the ban, said 660,000 rupees (approx. RM39,000) in fines had been collected during the first three days. She said 132 premises had been issued with penalties including outlets of Burger King, McDonald’s and Starbucks. A branch of Godrej Nature’s Basket, a high-end Indian supermarket, had also been penalised, Choudhari added. “All were fined for using banned plastic straws and disposable cutlery etc,” she told AFP. A spokesperson for Starbucks in India said the company complies with local laws in all of its markets and was committed to “environmental sustainability”. Hardcastle Restaurants, which runs the McDonald’s franchise in Mumbai, said it had “successfully transitioned from plastic to eco-friendly and biodegradable alternatives” such as wooden cutlery. Authorities hope the ban will help clean up Mumbai’s beaches and streets, which like other cities in India are awash with vast mountains of plastic rubbish. Plastic has also been blamed for blocking drains and contributing to flooding during the city’s four-month-long summer monsoon. Authorities first announced the ban — which covers the whole of Maharashtra state, of which Mumbai is the capital — three months ago to allow businesses to prepare. The majority of India’s 29 states have a full or partial ban on single-use plastics but the law is rarely enforced. Choudhari said more than 8,000 businesses had been searched in Mumbai alone and at least 700 kilogrammes (1,500 pounds) of plastic seized. Small traders, however, have claimed that the crackdown threatens their livelihoods. Retailers associations say a confusion over what is and isn’t allowed has led small grocery stores to remain closed for fear of being fined. The Plastic Bags Manufacturers Association of India estimates that 300,000 people employed in the industry could lose their jobs. The United Nations warned earlier this month that the world could be awash with 12 billion tonnes of plastic trash by the middle of the century if use is maintained at current levels. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently pledged to make India, which was the host of this year’s International Environment Day, free of single-use plastic by 2022. — AFP
New UK interior minister vows to resolve immigration scandal  [SEP]  LONDON (AP) — Britain's new interior minister vowed Monday to sort out an immigration scandal shaking the government, saying that as the child of immigrants he was angered by the mistreatment of long-term residents from the Caribbean. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said he would do "whatever it takes" to resolve the status of all those who have become innocent casualties of the Conservative government's tough immigration policies. "We will do right by the Windrush generation," Javid told lawmakers in the House of Commons. Prime Minister Theresa May appointed Javid to the key job Monday, hours after predecessor Amber Rudd resigned over her role in what has become known as the Windrush scandal. The furor began weeks ago when the Guardian newspaper reported that some people from the Caribbean who have lived in Britain for decades had been refused medical care or threatened with deportation because they couldn't produce paperwork proving their right to reside in the country. Those affected are known as the "Windrush generation" after the ship Empire Windrush, which in 1948 brought hundreds of Caribbean immigrants to a Britain seeking nurses, railway workers and others to help it rebuild after the devastation of World War II. They and many subsequent Commonwealth immigrants had an automatic right to settle in the U.K. But some have now been denied housing, jobs or medical treatment because of requirements that employers and doctors check people's immigration status. Others have been told by the government that they are in Britain illegally and must leave. Outrage at their treatment has piled pressure on May, who was home secretary between 2010 and 2016 and introduced tough immigration policies intended to make Britain a "hostile environment" for unauthorized migrants. "It is the prime minister who has created the fundamental reasons for the Windrush scandal," said Joanna Cherry, home affairs spokeswoman for the opposition Scottish National Party. Javid, the son of Pakistani immigrants, is the first politician from an ethnic minority to hold one of the four top jobs in Britain's government — prime minister, finance minister, foreign secretary and home secretary. "Like the Caribbean Windrush generation, my parents came to this country from the Commonwealth in the 1960s," Javid said. "They too came to help rebuild this country and offer all that they had." Javid said that when he saw the plight of the Windrush migrants, "I thought that it could be my mum, my brother, my uncle or even me." He distanced himself from the phrase "hostile environment," saying "it is a phrase that is unhelpful and it does not represent our values as a country." Immigration is a divisive issue in Britain, and reducing the number of newcomers was a major factor for many voters who in 2016 backed leaving the European Union. The Conservative government has an oft-stated but long-unmet goal of reducing net immigration below 100,000 people a year, less than half the current level. Still, the treatment of the Windrush generation has sparked dismay across the political spectrum in Britain. Rudd and May both apologized repeatedly, saying that all pre-1973 Commonwealth immigrants who don't already have British citizenship will get it and those affected will get compensation. But Rudd's position worsened after she told lawmakers last week that the government didn't have targets for deporting people — only for a 2017 memo to emerge that mentioned specific targets for "enforced removals." Rudd said she didn't see the memo, but The Guardian later published a leaked letter she wrote to the prime minister discussing an aim of increasing removals by 10 percent. In a resignation letter to the prime minister, Rudd said she had "inadvertently" misled lawmakers. May said she accepted that Rudd had spoken "in good faith" and was sorry to see her resign. The Windrush scandal is also causing anxiety for the 3 million European Union citizens living in Britain who are concerned about their immigration status after the country leaves the EU next March. The British government says they will be allowed to stay.
'Ren & Stimpy' creator John Kricfalusi accused of preying on teens  [SEP]  Two women have come forward alleging John Kricfalusi, creator of The Ren & Stimpy Show, preyed on them when they were underage. In a story published by Buzzfeed News on Thursday, Robyn Byrd and Katie Rice relay stories of being groomed as teenage fans of the popular early '90s cartoon show, only to find themselves pursued sexually by Kricfalusi, now 62. Byrd says she wrote Kricfalusi a fan letter at age 13 and was elated when the animator then 39, responded. He sent her toys and visited her at the Arizona trailer park where she lived. When she was 16, she says, he flew her to his home in Los Angeles and touched her sexually. Buzzfeed News writes that In the summer of 1997, before her senior year of high school, he flew Byrd to Los Angeles again, offering her an internship at his studio. She lived with him as his 16-year-old girlfriend and intern and after she finished high school, Byrd moved in with him at age 17. A lawyer for Kricfalusi admitted to Buzzfeed News that "for a brief time, 25 years ago, he had a 16-year-old girlfriend" and detailed a period of mental illness. Katie Rice, who also had dreams of being an animator as a teen, says Kricfalusi befriended her when she was 14, even attending her 15th birthday party. He was 40. Kricfalusi eventually hired her to work for him, beginning a long span of sexual harassment. Rice ultimately left, she says, after he made a joke about raping her and she found child pornography on his computer. Through an attorney, Kricfalusi told Buzzfeed News he has never possessed child porn. In a statement to Buzzfeed News, Kricfalusi's lawyer responded to the allegations in full. “The 1990s were a time of mental and emotional fragility for Mr. Kricfalusi, especially after losing Ren & Stimpy, his most prized creation. For a brief time, 25 years ago, he had a 16-year-old girlfriend. Over the years John struggled with what were eventually diagnosed mental illnesses in 2008. To that point, for nearly three decades he had relied primarily on alcohol to self-medicate. "Since that time he has worked feverishly on his mental health issues, and has been successful in stabilizing his life over the last decade. This achievement has allowed John the opportunity to grow and mature in ways he’d never had a chance at before.” According to the Los Angeles Times, Nickelodeon fired Kricfalusi in 1992 during the second season of Ren & Stimpy's five-season run, citing failure to meet delivery deadlines. Kricfalusi's short-lived Adult Party Cartoon ran on TNN in the early 2000s. TNN, a Viacom property, which has undergone name changes and is now The Paramount Network, told USA TODAY in a statement it "never received any claims of sexual harassment (or other misconduct) against John Kricfalusi." Nickelodeon declined to comment. Ren & Stimpy reruns still play on weeknights on TeenNick, which is part of Nickelodeon. Kricfalusi most recently made art for Miley Cyrus’s 2014 Bangerz tour and screened a new animated short, Cans Without Labels, at a film festival in 2016. Earlier this week, Nickelodeon cut ties with Dan Schneider, the television producer behind many of the network's most iconic and enduring programs, including All That, iCarly, Drake & Josh, Zoey 101, Victorious, Kenan & Kel and Henry Danger.
Why John Cena Bowed Out Of WWE Crown Jewel In Saudi Arabia  [SEP]  “What an honor and a privilege it is to be allowed to be part of an event like today. Regardless of what is going on in my universe, I was not going to miss this event for anything in the world. I want to send a genuine thank you to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for its unmatched hospitality that extends far beyond this evening. I also want to say once again thank all of you for allowing me to be part of something so special.” Five months ago, John Cena stood in the middle of a ring in King Abdullah International Stadium with sweat dripping from his head and a smile beaming ear to ear. The 16-time World Champion and face of World Wrestling Entertainment had just disposed of Triple H at The Greatest Royal Rumble in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Moments after the referee raised his hand in victory, Cena grabbed the microphone to address the 60,000 fans on-hand to witness the historic event. Slowly and deliberately, he paid homage to the country nestled along the Arabian Peninsula, and every word was met with thunderous applause. His words had been carefully scripted, but seemed to flow effortlessly nonetheless. Cena has never been thought of as anything less than a company man and has often gone above and beyond during a near 20-year career to cast WWE in the best light possible whenever asked. That night in Jeddah would be no different. >>MORE: 16 Things You Didn’t Know About WWE Superstar John Cena But when the WWE returns to Saudi Arabia for Crown Jewel on Friday, everything will be different. An encore performance would risk irrevocable damage to Cena’s skyrocketing career outside of the ring. Many compare the WrestleMania main eventer’s trajectory to that of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, who has become a dominant force in Hollywood and top global box office attraction since hanging up his boots. For Cena, committing to the controversial show is not worth gambling the starring roles, national television appearances, and a spot on the New York Times best-seller list. Not to mention the millions of dollars that come with all of them. The 41-year-old is one of two top stars in the company who have put their foot down and are refusing to participate. Both he and Daniel Bryan were written off the show this week after reportedly informing WWE executives that they had no intention of performing at King Saud University Stadium. Indeed, the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in early October has changed everything. In the face of overwhelming evidence, Saudi officials have confessed that the killing of the frequent critic of crown prince Mohammad bin Salman at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey was premeditated. And it’s unfathomable that such a gruesome and heinous act was carried out without the prior knowledge of MBS himself. A week ago, WWE officials opted to proceed with the event, despite a barrage of media scrutiny and mounting international pressure. But Cena and Bryan reportedly informed WWE of their decisions prior to that. >>MORE: WWE’s Controversial Crown Jewel Event In Saudi Arabia To Move Forward Multiple other talents and crew members have anonymously expressed their reservations about participating through the media but are traveling to Saudi Arabia nonetheless. The company says they have been listening to those concerns. “As always, we maintain an open line of communication with our performers and will address each situation accordingly,” WWE said in a statement. Interestingly, the biggest name in the history of pro wrestling will make his return on the show. Hulk Hogan will host Crown Jewel, according to multiple reports. The wrestling legend had been shunned by the company since racially insensitive remarks he made were surfaced in 2015. At the time, he was stripped of his standing in the WWE Hall of Fame, and the company essentially erased him from their history, washing away many of the most iconic moments in the history of sports entertainment in the process. Hogan was reinstated to the WWE Hall of Fame earlier this year. Chuck Carroll is former pro wrestling announcer and referee turned sports media personality. He once appeared on Monday Night RAW when he presented Robert Griffin III with a WWE title belt in the Redskins locker room.
Italian Emma Morano, last known survivor of 19th century, dies at 117  [SEP]  Emma Morano, born on November 29 1899, died at her home in Verbania, in northern Italy, Italian media report ROME, Italy – Emma Morano, an Italian woman believed to have been the oldest person alive and the last survivor of the 19th century, died Saturday, April 15, at the age of 117, Italian media reported. Morano, born on November 29 1899, died at her home in Verbania, in northern Italy, the reports said. "She had an extraordinary life, and we will always remember her strength to move forward in life," said Silvia Marchionini, the mayor of Verbania, a small village of some 2,000 residents. According to the US-based Gerontology Research Group (GRG), Morano ceded the crown of the world's oldest human being to Jamaican Violet Brown, who was born on March 10, 1900. Morano's death, at the age of 117 years and 137 days, means there is no one living known to have been born before 1900. Her first love died in World War I, but she married later and left her violent husband just before the Second World War and shortly after the death in infancy of her only son. That was 30 years before divorce became legal in Italy. She had clung to her independence, only taking on a full-time carer a couple of years ago, though she had not left her small two-room apartment for 20 years. She had been bed-bound during her latter years. In an interview with Agence France-Presse last year, she put her longevity down to her diet. "I eat two eggs a day, and that's it. And cookies. But I do not eat much because I have no teeth," she said in her home at the time, where the Guinness World Records certificate declaring her to be the oldest person alive held pride of place on a marble-topped chest of drawers. She also refused to be taken to hospital, with the exception of a cataract operation. Her Eyesight did become very poor and she latterly spent much of her days sleeping. But she kept her sense of humor till the end. "How does my hair look," she asked before blowing out the candles on her 117th birthday cake last year. "What impresses me most is her memory. She forgets nothing," Yamile Vergara, her nurse for over 40 years, said at the time. "Her sense of humor is her therapy". The eldest of 8 children, Morano outlived all of her younger siblings. Robert Young, director of the Los Angeles-based GRG's Supercentenarian Research and Database Division, said he had been following Morano 's progress for the past seven years, calling her an example of "super-aging individuals who seem to age at a slower rate than normal – maybe even a few percentage points slower, but enough to make a difference". The world longevity record, he noted, remained with French woman Jeanne Calment, who died at 122 in 1997, having outlived both her daughter and grandson. "That's superconfirmed," Young said. Emma Morano goes into the record books as the fifth longest life ever verified. In 1900, when Violet Brown was born, Jamaica was part of the British West Indies, so her records are from the British government, in Queen Victoria's time. "Unless a surprise candidate comes out of the trees, she is the oldest living Victorian," said Young. – Rappler.com
Islamic State says it launched rocket attack on Egypt navy vessel  [SEP]  CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt’s Islamic State affiliate said on Thursday it fired a rocket at an Egyptian naval vessel in the Mediterranean Sea near the coast of Israel and the Gaza Strip. The militant group Sinai Province has focused mainly on attacking Egyptian soldiers and police in the Sinai peninsula, killing hundreds since the army toppled Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in 2013 after mass protests against his rule. Photographs distributed online by the group appeared to show a rocket heading towards a ship and setting it ablaze on impact. Reuters could not verify the militants’ version of events. The Egyptian military said in a statement that a coastguard launch had exchanged shots with “terrorist elements”, causing the vessel to catch fire. It said there was no loss of life. Such incidents at sea are rare, though Egypt is battling an increasingly brazen Islamist insurgency in the Sinai that lies between Israel, the Gaza Strip and the Suez Canal. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has said militancy poses an existential threat to Egypt, the most populous Arab country. As army chief, Sisi overthrew Mursi and then launched a crackdown on Islamists, which has weakened his foes in the mainstream Muslim Brotherhood movement but failed to neutralize Sinai-based militants. Sinai Province, the most lethal militant group in Egypt, last year pledged loyalty to Islamic State, which controls large tracts of territory in Syria and Iraq and has a presence in Egypt’s neighbor Libya. It has recently carried out high profile attacks, which prompted the drafting of a sweeping counter-terrorism law. On July 1, 100 militants and at least 17 members of the security forces were killed in a single day of clashes and attacks claimed by Sinai Province, authorities said. The car bomb assassination of Egypt’s top prosecutor in Cairo last month has also raised concerns that the insurgency is spreading. A Reuters witness in Gaza saw a plume of dark grey smoke rising from a boat off the coast. Other witnesses in the Palestinian enclave said they heard explosions and gunfire. Military sources said the suspected militants had fled after firing on the vessel. Later in the day a small bomb exploded in a residential area of the upscale Cairo neighborhood of Heliopolis, wounding a police officer, security sources said. State television, meanwhile, announced the resignation of the Cairo police chief. It did not elaborate.
Mulvaney Tells Congress He Would Vote Against His Own Budget  [SEP]  Mick Mulvaney, President Donald Trump's budget director, told lawmakers at a Senate budget hearing Tuesday that were he still in Congress, he would not vote for the $4.4 trillion proposal he designed. Mulvaney, a former member of the House of Representatives who oversees the administration's budget priorities, faced a grilling from senators over the White House's 2019 budget, which would increase military spending, fund a new border wall and slash entitlement spending, among other priorities. "As a member of Congress representing the 5th district of South Carolina I probably would have found enough shortcomings in this to vote against it," said Mulvaney, who also serves as the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. "But I'm the director of the Office of Management and Budget, and my job is to fund the president's priorities, which is exactly what we did." Mulvaney was elected to the House in 2011 before he was tapped to serve as Trump's budget czar last year. Mulvaney has raised concerns in the past about the nation's debt and deficit. He told CBS's "Face The Nation" on Sunday that the two-year spending deal the president recently signed could be “very dangerous” for the deficit.
15 killed by cattle rustlers in northwestern Nigeria: Police  [SEP]  LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) — A police spokesman says at least 15 people have been killed by cattle rustlers who attacked a village in Nigeria's northwestern state of Zamfara. Muhammad Shehu tells The Associated Press the victims were killed late Friday in Zakuna village in what appeared to be a reprisal attack. Shehu says the cattle rustlers had been repelled in an attack earlier in the day but regrouped. Cattle rustlers have killed scores of people in Zamfara state since January amid growing tensions in the area. Insecurity remains a major problem in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country. In the northeast, security forces continue to battle the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram, which still carries out deadly suicide bombings and mass abductions.
Huge crater discovered hiding under Greenland ice is bigger than Washington, D.C.  [SEP]  An international team of researchers say they've discovered an impact crater of vast proportions hiding beneath more than a half-mile of ice in Greenland. More than 19 miles wide and about 1,000 feet deep, the huge bowl-shaped depression is bigger than Washington, D.C., and one of the 25 biggest craters ever discovered on Earth. It's also the first crater to have been discovered under a continental ice sheet. The crater formed when a meteorite more than half a mile wide smashed into an area that is now covered by the Hiawatha Glacier in northwestern Greenland, the researchers say in a paper describing their discovery. The researchers can't pinpoint the age of the crater. But its well-preserved condition suggests that it formed "after ice began to cover Greenland, so younger than three million years old and possibly as recently as 12,000 years ago," Kurt Kjaer, a professor at the Center for GeoGenetics at the Natural History Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen and the leader of the team, said in a written statement. Whatever the age of the crater, its discovery serves as a reminder that Earth still has a few secrets up its sleeve. "There is still so much more about our landscape that we have yet to understand," said Joe MacGregor, a glaciologist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and a member of the scientific team. "That's particularly true of the polar regions because so much is covered by ice." The researchers first spotted evidence of the crater in 2015 when they noticed an unusual feature on a topographical map made from data obtained by NASA aircraft that had surveyed the area with ice-penetrating radar. They spent the next three years confirming the discovery, using satellite imagery and additional aerial surveys made with a newer, more advanced radar system. "Radar sounding of ice sheets is a decades-old technology now, but the system we used to study Hiawatha Glacier is the most sophisticated yet deployed to survey a glacier," MacGregor told NBC News MACH in an email. In their final step to confirm the discovery, the scientists visited the area in 2016 and 2017 to collect samples of sediments that had washed out from under the glacier. The samples included bits of quartz with internal structures that were deformed by intense pressure. This so-called shocked quartz has been found in other impact craters as well as in areas where underground nuclear tests have been conducted. Its presence helped convince the researchers that the strange feature on the map really was an impact crater. Other scientists want more evidence. “I can say what they are presenting as shock quartz is definitely shock quartz,” Ludovic Ferriere, an impact crater expert at the Natural History Museum in Vienna, told National Geographic. "I think they have something here," he added, "but they make strong conclusions based on very preliminary data." Clark Chapman, a retired planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, expressed similar skepticism. He said in an email that while it was "plausible that the feature is an impact crater," it was hard to tell for sure because the landform is buried so deep beneath the ice and can't be directly reached. In response to the criticism, MacGregor said the researchers hope to return to the area to conduct additional research but acknowledged the difficulty of drilling through the ice and into the underlying bedrock to obtain more evidence. That would be a difficult process that could take several years, he said. But he said the existing evidence was sufficient and that — given the shape of the geologic feature under the ice and the sediment samples recovered nearby — there was only a "very slim" chance that the feature under the ice is not an impact crater. "The simplest explanation of our observations is that the glacier overlies an impact crater," he said.

Israel-Gaza border falls quiet after botched Israeli operation  [SEP]  GAZA/JERUSALEM: The Israel-Gaza border fell quiet on Monday after a botched Israeli undercover operation in the Gaza Strip led to fighting that killed a Hamas commander, six other Palestinian militants and an Israeli colonel. Palestinians fired 17 rockets into southern Israel late on Sunday in response to the incursion and air strikes, which Hamas, the dominant armed group in Gaza, said were intended to cover the retreat of a car used by the Israeli troops. There were no reports of injuries or damage in Israel, but the military said a lieutenant-colonel, identified only as "M", had been killed in the raid and another officer wounded. Hamas said the Israeli actions dealt a blow to Egyptian, Qatari and UN efforts to broker a long-term ceasefire between the Palestinian group and Israel and ease an Israeli blockade that has deepened economic hardship in Gaza. But neither side appeared eager to pursue broader conflict. Hamas received US$15 million in Qatari-donated cash via Israel on Friday to pay for civil servants' salaries and fuel to address Gaza's energy crisis. No new rocket launches were reported on Monday morning. Violence has flared regularly along the Israel-Gaza border since Palestinians began protests there on Mar 30 to demand rights to land lost to Israel in the 1948 war of its creation. Israeli gunfire has killed more than 220 Palestinians since the start of the demonstrations, which have included breaches of Israel's border fence. Hamas said that during Sunday's fighting, assailants in a passing vehicle opened fire on a group of its armed men, killing one of its local commanders, Nour Baraka. A pursuit ensued and witnesses said Israeli aircraft fired more than 40 missiles into the area. Palestinian officials said that in addition to Baraka, five other Hamas men and a member of the Popular Resistance Committees were killed. In an apparent attempt to defuse tensions, Israel's chief military spokesman said the special forces had not been dispatched to assassinate Hamas commanders, a tactic that led to wider conflict in the past and which has largely been abandoned. The spokesman, Brigadier-General Ronen Manelis, told Army Radio that covert missions were mounted frequently, comments that suggested the Israeli force may have been gathering intelligence. "During the operation, it found itself in a very complex situation, faced by enemy forces. The (Israeli) force, including Lieutenant-Colonel M., kept its cool, returned fire and evacuated itself together with the (help of the) air force back into Israel," Manelis said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a visit to Paris, where he attended World War One commemorations with other world leaders. He returned home early on Monday.
Japan toasts Takuma Sato after Indy 500 triumph  [SEP]  Formula One misfit Takuma Sato was the toast of Japan on Monday after becoming the first driver from his country to win the storied Indianapolis 500. The 40-year-old, once the butt of jokes in Formula One after several high-speed crashes, roared to victory Sunday to claim one of motor racing's biggest prizes, holding off Brazil's three-time winner Helio Castroneves in a dramatic climax. Evening editions of Monday's Japanese newspapers carried front-page photos of Sato standing on his car with his hands aloft, while others carried pictures of him pouring milk over his head in the traditional Brickyard celebration. "The best moment of my racing life," blazed a Tokyo Shimbun headline, quoting Sato after he had stolen the thunder of temporary Andretti Autosport teammate Fernando Alonso, the two-time Formula One world champion. Even Japan's normally straight-laced economic daily the Nikkei Shimbun got mildly excited, trumpeting "Japan's first-ever victory". Sato himself could barely contain his joy after winning the Indy 500 at his eighth attempt. "It's unbelievable," he told local media. "It's so special just to be racing in front of 35,000 fans. "For Japan, for the team and for (engine suppliers) Honda, this is a special victory." Sato dedicated his victory to the people of northeastern Japan still recovering from the deadly tsunami of 2011 which killed more than 18,000 people. "I can't begin to thank the Japanese fans," he said. "It's been a long road. Japan is still struggling to recover (from the disaster) so I hope I can give the children something to dream about." In contrast to Sunday's thrilling win, Sato's last-lap dash to grab the lead from Dario Franchitti in 2012 was the stuff of nightmares, ending with the Japanese driver in a wall. That incident did little to dispel the image of Sato, lingering since his Formula One days, as an accident waiting to happen. The Japanese spent seven seasons in F1 but notably incurred the wrath of several of the sport's top drivers, including Michael Schumacher, while former Toyota boss Tsutomu Tomita branded him "reckless'. That was all forgotten on Sunday, however, as Sato exorcised his demons with a superb drive. "I knew I could do it," he said. "I was waiting for the moment and the last two laps, the car worked beautifully."
Saudi World Cup players land safely after apparent engine fire  [SEP]  "The fire was merely an accident" read one tweet from the national team's verified account while another said the team was "heading to their residence safely." Video circulating on social media showed what appeared to be a fire on the wing of an aircraft. A series of follow up posts showed Saudi players calmly disembarking the plane and then later arriving at a hotel in Rostov-on-Don. The plane was was provided by the the International Air Transport Association (IATA) organizational committee for the teams participating in the World Cup, the Saudi Football Federation later said in a statement posted to Twitter.
Mail Bombing Suspect Identity Confirmed: 56-Year-Old with Arrest Record  [SEP]  A South Florida man with a past criminal record was arrested on Friday in connection to the explosive devices sent to prominent Democrats this week. “A law enforcement official identified the suspect as Cesar Sayoc, Jr., 56, of Aventura, Fla, just north of Miami,” The New York Times reported. Sayoc has a criminal record dating back to 1991 that includes felony theft, drug and fraud charges, as well as threatening to use a bomb in 2002. His most recent arrest was in 2015 for a probation violation, according to South Florida’s Sun Sentinal. On Friday, authorities tracked him down to the parking lot of a shopping center in Plantation, Florida at 11 a.m. Eastern, according to The Washington Post. Sayoc is a registered Republican, who is originally from New York. The Department of Justice plans to hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m. Eastern to discuss the investigation and arrest. Fox News reported that federal authorities had been focusing on Florida as the locations where are the majority of the 12 packages had originated. “Some of the packages went through the mail,” Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen earlier told Fox News. “They originated, some of them, from Florida. I am confident that this person or people will be brought to justice.” “The envelopes and packaging materials likely contained a treasure trove of DNA information. Tiny bits of genetic material — traces of sweat, skin cells, saliva, hair or fingerprints – are typically used as a roadmap to the suspect’s door, investigators and bomb experts say,” Fox reported. Photos of the van, believed to belong to Sayoc, have popped up online. Federal authorities took possession of it Friday. The van was covered with stickers, including those in support of President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. RELATED: Sarah: Trump No More Responsible for Bombs Than Bernie Was for Scalise Shooting Trump addressed Sayoc’s arrest in remarks at the White House, saying: “We must never allow political violence to take root in America.” He promised “swift and certain justice” and said the suspect would be prosecuted “to the fullest extent of the law.” Trump praised the FBI, DOJ, the Secret Service, the New York Police Department and all law enforcement agencies involved for quickly finding the suspect.

Ottawa, Washington to ban offshore oil and gas licences in Arctic waters  [SEP]  The Liberal government has joined with U.S. President Barack Obama to restrict oil and gas development in Arctic waters, and regulated fisheries and shipping lanes as the ice cover recedes as a result of climate change. In a joint release Tuesday, the two governments said the measures would ensure “a strong, sustainable and viable Arctic economy and ecosystem.” For his part, Mr. Obama designated the vast majority of U.S. waters off Alaska in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas as “indefinitely” off limits to oil and gas leasing, though President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans who control Congress will no doubt look to reverse that decision. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government will designate all Canadian waters in the Arctic as indefinitely off-limits to future oil and gas licensing, a ban that will be reviewed every five years. Existing industry leases remain in place but it is not clear whether producers will be able to gain regulatory approval for drilling. Major oil companies have slammed the brakes on Arctic exploration, owing to shaky economics and technical challenges. Last year, Imperial Oil Ltd. together with partners Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP PLC suspended their effort to win regulatory approval to an exploration program in the Canadian portion of the Beaufort Sea. The companies had planned to drill in water depths up to 1,500 metres about 175 kilometres north of Tuktoyaktuk, N.W.T. An initial well was planned for the summer of 2020 at the earliest. However, the partners said they needed more time to study the Arctic’s harsh conditions. Imperial has sought to extend the life of permits that are set to expire in 2019 and 2020 to 16 years, up from nine currently. One of the biggest obstacles is meeting National Energy Board requirements that compel companies to drill a so-called relief well in the same season as a producing one in order to have the ability to cap any possible blowout. Imperial and U.S. oil major Chevron Corp. had both sought exemptions from the rule, arguing it was not feasible given the short northern drilling season. Chevron also cited weak oil prices when it scrapped its own exploration program in 2014. It could take more than a decade before such plans are revisited, given current projections for future prices, said John Hogg, president of Skybattle Resources Ltd. in Calgary. “If oil was north of $75 and stable, I think that they could start looking at it again,” he said. “There’s a potential for billion-barrel oil fields out there, so I don’t see the super-majors ever losing sight of the fact that they’ve acquired the seismic [data]. They know where they’d like to drill.”
Argentina seeking credit line from IMF  [SEP]  President Mauricio Macri says Argentina has begun talks with the International Monetary Fund about a credit line following sharp devaluation of its currency. Macri said Tuesday that he's in talks with the head of the IMF to obtain a credit line to combat economic woes and a difficult "global scenario." Argentina was forced to impose three recent interest rate hikes to halt a sharp devaluation of its peso. The peso fell to a historic low versus the U.S. dollar and Argentina's debt sank in price last week after a string of monetary and fiscal policy decisions that have been criticized by investors. The government's woes began in December when investors began doubting its commitment to curb consumer prices after it announced a rise in its inflation target to 15 percent.
Trump may be floating a plan to fire Jeff Sessions, potentially jeopardizing Mueller's Russia probe  [SEP]  • President Donald Trump is drawing up a plan to fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions, according to a Vanity Fair report. • Trump's opinion of Sessions took a nosedive after Sessions recused himself last year from the FBI's Russia investigation. • Trump is said to be considering replacing Sessions with Scott Pruitt, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator. • Should he become the attorney general, Pruitt could theoretically fire the special counsel Robert Mueller. President Donald Trump has been formulating a plan to fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Vanity Fair reported on Wednesday. Sessions has been a target of Trump's ire since he recused himself last March from the FBI's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 US election, following reports that he was not forthcoming during his Senate confirmation hearing about his contacts with Russian officials during the campaign. Sessions' recusal is a key point of frustration for Trump, who once reportedly asked why he couldn't order "my guys" at the "Trump Justice Department" to do what he wanted. When the Russia investigation began picking up steam last summer, so did Trump's attacks on his hand-picked attorney general, whom he called "weak" and "beleaguered" in a string of tweets. He also repeatedly suggested Sessions should replace Andrew McCabe as deputy FBI director. McCabe was forced out of the FBI earlier this year amid an internal investigation into his handling of the bureau's investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server as secretary of state. On Wednesday, The New York Times reported that Sessions was weighing whether to fire McCabe over allegations of misconduct days before he's set to retire. Trump's tweets last summer came soon after he acknowledged in an interview with The Times that he would not have nominated Sessions to be attorney general had he known Sessions would recuse himself from the Russia investigation. "Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job, and I would have picked somebody else," Trump told the newspaper. Sessions said over the weekend that he believed he made the right decision by stepping aside from the Russia investigation. Robert Mueller, the special counsel leading the Russia probe, is believed to be focusing on the period last summer when Trump ramped up his attempts to pressure Sessions to carry out his suggestions. That inquiry makes up one thread of Mueller's investigation into whether Trump sought to obstruct justice when he fired James Comey as FBI director last May. The White House initially said Comey was fired because of the way he handled the Clinton investigation. But Trump later said on national television that he fired Comey in part because of "this Russia thing." He also reportedly told two top Russian government officials that dismissing the FBI director had taken "great pressure" off of him. After Comey's firing, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller as the special counsel in charge of the Russia investigation. Typically, such an appointment falls to the attorney general, but Sessions did not do so because of his recusal. Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, could replace Sessions if he is fired. Carolyn Kaster/AP Should Sessions be fired, Trump is mulling replacing him with Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Vanity Fair reported. Though he is already a Cabinet secretary, Pruitt would need to go through a second Senate confirmation hearing because he would be moving to a different department. This type of rapid Cabinet shuffling is unprecedented in US history. Trump also nominated Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, as his new secretary of state after firing Rex Tillerson on Monday. Pompeo's second confirmation hearing will most likely be in April. If Pruitt were to become the attorney general, he would not be recused from the Russia investigation and could theoretically fire the special counsel.
Knife-wielding man shot dead in Brussels ‘terror attack’  [SEP]  BRUSSELS — Belgian soldiers shot a man dead in downtown Brussels on Friday evening after he attacked the troops with a knife in what prosecutors described as a "terror attack." Spokesperson Esther Natus of the federal prosecutor's office, which handles terrorism investigations, said the man twice shouted "Allahu akbar," Arabic for "God is great," as he ran at the soldiers. "We do consider it a terror attack," Natus said. She declined to identify the man or confirm whether he was known to police, saying only that "the suspect is dead" and one of the soldiers was slightly wounded. Brussels Mayor Philippe Close said three soldiers came under attack and one had been hospitalized. Federal Police spokesperson Jonathan Pfunde also confirmed some details of the incident and said the attacker had been "neutralized." Belgium's anti-terror crisis centre tweeted that the situation was "under control." "All our support is with our soldiers," Prime Minister Charles Michel said via Twitter. "Our security services remain on alert. We are following the situation closely." Associated Press television images showed that police sealed off a main street near the Grand Place, a central square that is a popular tourist site. A man who lives near where the incident took place on Boulevard Emile Jacquemain said he saw the attacker lying in the street in the aftermath. "I live right in front of the station. It was already blocked by police at the scene and there was a man lying on the ground. The police said he had been shot by soldiers," said Thomas da Silva Rosa, a public affairs consultant.
Fed Vice Chairman Fischer to resign for ‘personal reasons’  [SEP]  WASHINGTON — Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer will resign next month for personal reasons, leaving a fourth vacancy on the seven-member Fed governing board. Fischer, 73, has been a member of the board since May 2014. He previously served as governor of the Bank of Israel from 2005 through 2013. His term as Vice Chairman expires next June. His resignation will provide President Donald Trump with another opportunity to reshape the Fed. Trump has nominated Randal Quarles for one of the vacancies as vice chairman for bank supervision. Janet Yellen’s own term as Fed Chair expires in February, and Trump has not indicated whether he will keep or replace her.
Under New Leader, Gambia Cancels Withdrawal From International Criminal Court  [SEP]  As Gambia's new president Adama Barrow settles into his new role, he is also taking steps to resuscitate international ties cut off by his predecessor Yahya Jammeh, including membership to the International Criminal Court and the Commonwealth of Nations. The tiny West African nation has now formally informed the United Nations that it is reversing its request to withdraw from the International Criminal Court, made by Jammeh last October. The new government issued a statement announcing its reversal on state television, Reuters reported. "As a new government that has committed itself to the promotion of human rights ... we reaffirm The Gambia's commitment to the principles enshrined in the Rome Statue of the International Criminal Court," the government said. Jammeh's withdrawal from the ICC had not yet taken hold — according to the terms of the Rome Statute, a state's withdrawal goes into effect a year after initial notification. At the time, Gambia had accused the court of being biased against Africans, with one government minister going so far as to describe it as the "International Caucasian Court," as The Two-Way reported. Gambia, like South Africa and Burundi, accused the court of ignoring crimes of non-African nations and took steps to withdraw late last year. Here's more from our previous reporting: "Every person tried by the ICC since the treaty creating it was adopted in 1998 has been African. "Other war crimes trials have been carried out by ad hoc tribunals created after a specific conflict, such as those created for Yugoslavia and Cambodia, or for the Nuremberg trials conducted after World War II." Clément Capo-Chichi, Africa regional coordinator with the Coalition for the International Criminal Court, told The Associated Press that the move is a "crucial victory for victims of grave crimes and the rule of law." Barrow's road to the presidency was extremely tumultuous. In December's presidential election he defeated Jammeh, the leader of Gambia for 22 years. But then Jammeh refused to step down, eventually resulting in West African military troops crossing Gambia's borders. After Barrow was sworn into office in neighboring Senegal, Jammeh eventually succumbed to massive international pressure and left the country. He fled to Equatorial Guinea – incidentally, a country that is not a member state of the ICC. Now, the new Gambian government is also receiving high-profile diplomatic visits and pledges of international support. U.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson paid Barrow a visit Tuesday, which the BBC describes as "the first to the Gambia by a British foreign secretary." On the agenda: Gambia's request to rejoin the Commonwealth of Nations, an international organization comprised of 52 nations that were once British colonies. The former leader pulled Gambia out of the Commonwealth in 2013, according to a statement from the organization. Now, a Commonwealth spokesperson said it welcomed the move: "We looked forward to the country's eventual return because it was part of our very close knit family and our doors have always remained open." The European Union has also declared a "new chapter of relations with The Gambia." It froze assistance nearly three years ago, according to the BBC. But last week, EU Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development Neven Mimica traveled to Gambia and announced a $79 million package of immediate support. Jammeh had a dismal human rights record. Barrow appears to be taking steps to change that pattern. As Reuters reported, "police opened their first investigation on Monday into unresolved deaths and disappearances under Jammeh." In a recent press conference, Barrow also stated that he intends to convene a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to address human rights violations of his predecessor. He was also candid about the scope of obstacles he faces: "There was a government here for 22 years. 22 years is a long time. And we are able to change the government after 22 years, so obviously there will be a lot of challenges. To look at all the system, and make a complete overhaul. I think that is a big challenge to my new government."
TV anchor, photojournalist killed when tree falls on vehicle  [SEP]  TRYON, NC – A North Carolina state trooper says a tree fell across a highway, crushing a vehicle from a South Carolina television station and killing a TV anchor and photojournalist. Master Trooper Murico Stephens says the tree struck the WYFF-TV vehicle around 2:30 p.m. Monday on U.S. Highway 176 near Tryon. The area received heavy rain from the fringes of Subtropical Storm Alberto. WYFF-TV says anchor Mike McCormick and photojournalist Aaron Smeltzer were heading to a story when they were killed. A fire chief in North Carolina says he spoke to the TV anchor and his photojournalist out of South Carolina 10 minutes before they were struck and killed by a falling tree. Tryon Fire Chief Geoffrey Tennant’s voice broke Monday as he talked about recognizing the WYFF-TV vehicle under the large tree and the two men dead inside on U.S. Highway 176 near Tryon. Tennant said at a news conference that WYFF-TV anchor Mike McCormick and photojournalist Aaron Smeltzer told him to be safe as Subtropical Storm Alberto was expected to bring more flooding and mudslides to Polk County. Tennant says he told the TV crew to be safe, too. Tennant thinks the roots of the 3-foot (91-centimeter) diameter tree were loosened in ground saturated by a week’s worth of rain. The fringes of Alberto brought up to 2 inches (5 centimeters) of rain to the area Monday. Anchor Carol Goldsmith said on air that McCormick and Smeltzer were “beloved members of our team — our family.” The tree fell in Polk County not far from where a landslide killed a woman in her home on May 19 after heavy rains.
The Latest: Presidents, lawmakers laud McCain as patriot  [SEP]  WASHINGTON (AP) - The Latest on the death of Sen. John McCain (all times local): Sen. John McCain is being remembered for his service in war and in Congress by presidents and lawmakers. The longtime Arizona Republican died Saturday after a yearlong battle with brain cancer. President Donald Trump has offered his "deepest sympathies and respect" to McCain's family. The man who defeated McCain for the presidency in 2008, Barack Obama, says they shared a fidelity to American ideals. McCain's opponent for the GOP nomination in 2000, George W. Bush, calls his former political rival a "man of deep conviction and a patriot of the highest order." McCain is expected to be honored in Arizona and Washington before being buried, likely this coming week, at the U.S. Naval Academy Cemetery in Annapolis, Maryland. Bush is among those expected to speak at McCain's funeral.

Frenchman admits killing girl, 9, who vanished from Alps wedding  [SEP]  A former military dog trainer has confessed to "unintentionally" killing a nine-year-old girl whose disappearance from a wedding party in the Alps last year prompted nationwide concern and months of fruitless searching. Investigators at last found Maelys De Araujo's skull and some other remains on Wednesday in a snow-covered ravine six months after she went missing, according to Grenoble prosecutor Jean-Yves Coquillat. Police were led to the remote site by chief suspect Nordahl Lelandais, who was arrested and charged after her disappearance but had repeatedly denied wrongdoing. He was a guest at the same wedding in Pont-de-Beauvoisin, near the French mountain city of Chambery. Lelandais decided to come clean on Wednesday after investigators found traces of the girl's blood in the boot of Lelandais's car, the prosecutor told reporters. Lelandais told investigators that he killed her accidentally, hid the body near his house and then returned to the wedding party. He later dumped the child's body in the remote ravine. His lawyer said Lelandais had let children at the wedding party look at dogs he had in his car. After Maelys went missing, police questioned more than 200 potential witnesses, and hundreds of volunteers helped search the area for days. Police dogs found the girl's scent but lost it in the wedding hall car park, suggesting she may have been forced into a vehicle or got into one voluntarily. In his confession, Lelandais did not explain the circumstances of the girl's death, the prosecutor said. "Lelandais asked investigation judges to question him today, because he had revelations to make," the prosecutor said. Afterwards, the prosecutor said, Lelandais apologised to the girl and her parents. His lawyer Alain Jakubowicz described surprise at hearing Lelandais's confession of Maelys's "accidental death", but did not give further details about what happened. The lawyer said he was dropping his request for Lelandais's release. "I'm a father. Nothing worse can happen to you as a parent," he said, choking up. Lelandais is also now suspected of killing a soldier months before in the same region.
Mass graves with 166 bodies found in eastern Mexico  [SEP]  MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The bodies of 166 people have been found in the Mexican state of Veracruz, prosecutors said on Thursday, the latest in a string of grim discoveries made in the eastern region in recent years. State attorney general Jorge Winckler told a news conference that investigators discovered the bodies in 32 graves in the central part of the state after an Aug. 8 tip from an unidentified person that they had been dumped there. Veracruz has long been wracked by violent crime, and is an important trafficking route for drug gangs moving narcotics north towards the U.S. border. Winckler did not reveal the precise location of the graves. Analysis of the remains indicated the bodies had probably not been there for more than two years, he said. In March 2017, Winckler announced the discovery of more than 250 skulls in unmarked graves in the state.
‘Darkness and evil prevail’ as Duterte critic arrested in Philippines  [SEP]  Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte’s fiercest critic in Congress has been arrested after the president revoked his 2011 amnesty for a failed coup attempt and revived rebellion charges against him. Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte’s fiercest critic in Congress has been arrested after the president revoked his 2011 amnesty for a failed coup attempt and revived rebellion charges against him. Senator Antonio Trillanes IV walked out of the Senate, where he has taken refuge for weeks, and was taken by police to their headquarters in Makati city, where his fingerprints and mugshot were taken. After being booked by police, he was escorted to a nearby court and posted bail, trailed by a host of journalists. “Democracy lost today,” he told reporters shortly before his arrest. “Darkness and evil prevailed in our country. Whatever happens in the future will be in the hands of the Filipino people.” Known for outbursts against his critics, Mr Duterte has long expressed anger against Mr Trillanes, who has accused him of large-scale corruption, involvement in illegal drugs and extrajudicial killings in an anti-drug crackdown that has left thousands of suspects dead since he took office in 2016. The president has denied the allegations. Mr Trillanes, a former navy officer, was jailed for more than seven years for involvement in at least three army uprisings, including a 2003 mutiny against then president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo when he and other young officers rigged part of a road in the Makati financial district with bombs and took over an upscale residential building. After being given amnesty under Mr Duterte’s predecessor, Benigno Aquino III, Mr Trillanes successfully petitioned two Philippine courts to dismiss rebellion and coup cases, allowing him to later run for public office. Mr Duterte said he voided Mr Trillanes’ amnesty last month because the senator had failed to file a formal amnesty request and acknowledge guilt. The senator has strongly denied the president’s claims and has provided news reports and defence department documents to counter them. The Department of Justice asked two courts to issue warrants for Mr Trillanes’s arrest and resume criminal proceedings against him. One of the courts issued the arrest warrant on Tuesday. Aside from the rebellion and coup-related charges in the two courts, Mr Duterte has also ordered the military to resume an inquiry into the senator’s role in the mutinies. Legal experts and the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, the country’s largest lawyers’ group, have expressed alarm over the legal moves against Mr Trillanes for offences that were cancelled by the 2011 amnesty. The lawyers’ group said the move “runs roughshod over the constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy” – holding a person to answer twice for the same offence. The president has also accused Mr Trillanes, without offering evidence, of plotting with other opposition politicians, including the Liberal Party and leftist groups, to oust him. Mr Trillanes and opposition groups have dismissed the claim as a lie and asked Mr Duterte to focus instead on addressing poverty, inflation, rice shortages, traffic jams and a decline in the value of the peso currency. Human Rights Watch said Mr Trillanes’s arrest “is part of the persecution of critics of the Duterte administration, the latest in the relentless campaign to silence those who dared to challenge the president’s murderous ‘drug war'”. Under Mr Duterte, another opposition senator has been jailed on illegal drug charges, a critical Supreme Court chief justice has been ousted by fellow judges, and foreign critics, including an Australian nun, have been barred from entering the Philippines or threatened with deportation.
How To Help Those Affected By Hurricane Florence  [SEP]  Floodwaters keep rising in the Carolinas as post-Tropical Cyclone Florence continues to dump rain on the region. The dangerous storm has already left more than 30 dead and displaced thousands of others, leaving them without electricity or shelter. In the aftermath of Florence, North and South Carolina officials are encouraging people to volunteer or donate if they can. Here's a guide to how to help. Cash is king after a disaster, says Julia Brooks, a researcher with the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative. The initiative analyzes and improves the ways in which communities and professionals respond to emergencies. Brooks has studied dozens of disasters, and said that often people's inclination is to donate supplies, but doing so can actually hinder recovery efforts. "[Supplies] often clog up transportation systems; they become a burden on first responders in the area to manage, sort, warehouse and distribute, and often they aren't even the things that people need on the ground," Brooks said. "The exception is, when credible groups on the ground are requesting specific things and are saying that they are set up to receive them." When in doubt, she says, donating cash is better. With that in mind, people who are looking to donate should be wary of who they are donating to and should research on any organizations before donating to it. Charity Navigator scores charities based on their financial reports and can help guide decisions on whether or not to donate to various organizations. Most people are familiar with major organizations like the American Red Cross, the United Way and the Salvation Army. Here are some other reputable, national organizations also accepting donations: Gleaning for the World — Gleaning for the World provides surplus medical and essential supplies from corporate donors for humanitarian efforts worldwide. The organization began accepting donations for Hurricane Florence prior to the storm making landfall. People can make cash donations on its website, which will be used to support the distribution of donated supplies. The organization has a score of 84 out of 100 on Charity Navigator. GlobalGiving --This organization's Hurricane Florence Relief Fund will initially support immediate needs for food, fuel, water, hygiene products and shelter, then transition to longer-term recovery efforts. GlobalGiving works by funding the relief efforts of vetted local organizations. It has a 96 rating on Charity Navigator. Donors Choose -- Donors Choose is currently accepting cash donations to "help teachers care for their students and restock their classrooms with materials like books, furniture, classroom supplies, technology, and therapy resources" in areas hit by the hurricane. The organization has a score of 96 out of 100 on Charity Navigator. International Medical Corps — A global nonprofit, International Medical Corps specializes in providing healthcare and medical supplies to disaster stricken regions. They are currently on the ground in North Carolina and providing medical treatment and are asking for financial support. The organization has a score of 84 out of 100 on Charity Navigator. GoFundMe — GoFundMe has set up a landing page that aggregates verified campaigns intended to help those affected by Hurricane Florence. Campaigns have been started by organizations such as the Task Force 75 Inc. NFP, which is a volunteer disaster response team mainly made up of U.S. military veterans who believe that their service to the country and its citizens has not ended. Operation BBQ Relief -- Operation BBQ Relief provides meals for both displaced residents and emergency personnel. According the organization's website, they have prepared equipment and resources and are ready to move into hurricane affected areas as soon as it is safe. They are asking for cash donations as well as volunteers. The group was founded in May 2011. World Hope International — The Virginia based charity World Hope International is on the ground in affected areas and accepting donations. The group is working with their church partners to distribute supplies and has a score of 92 out of 100 on Charity Navigator. Local organizations often have a more intimate knowledge of local conditions and the best ways to address community issues. In terms of whether to donate locally or nationally, Brooks said, "It really depends. I wouldn't say it's better to find a national or a local organization, it's good to find a credible organization." North Carolina has created a list of "Voluntary Organizations Active in a Disaster," which lists some local organizations. We've highlighted a few of these, as well as other credible local organizations in North and South Carolina: The North Carolina Disaster Relief Fund — Set up and managed by the state's government, the fund is accepting funds as well as volunteers. Contributions will help with immediate unmet needs of Hurricane Florence victims. In addition to donating online, you can text Florence to 20222 or mail your contribution to: North Carolina Disaster Relief Fund, 20312 Mail Service Center, Raleigh, N.C. 27699. One SC Fund -- Set up by the former governor of South Carolina and current ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley along with a community foundation, the One SC Fund provides grants to nonprofits to fund relief and recovery efforts in state-declared emergencies, like Hurricane Florence. Hearts With Hands — Based in Asheville, N.C., Hearts With Hands is an "outreach ministry" nonprofit that was established in 1992 after Hurricane Andrew struck Florida and focuses on hurricane relief. They are accepting cash donations and have a specific list of needed in-kind goods on their website, such as wash clothes, travel size toiletries and razors. Foundation For The Carolinas — The foundation has created a hurricane response fund that is being used to funnel money to nonprofits in North and South Carolina. The foundation has a score of 94 out of 100 on Charity Navigator. Lutheran Services Carolinas — Lutheran Services Carolinas is a faith-based organization that has locations across North and South Carolina. They are accepting donations for "long-term recovery." Baptists on Mission — Money donated to Baptists on Mission will assist 2nd Baptist Church in Washington, N.C. and Temple Baptist Church in New Bern, N.C. in providing meals for those affected by the storm, among other things. The group is also asking for volunteers. World Central Kitchen — The World Central Kitchen was founded by chef Jose Andres after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. Using a food truck to deliver food to New Hanover, Columbus, Brunswick and Pender counties in North Carolina, the World Central Kitchen in Wilmington is partnership between Andres and a local Wilmington, N.C. Chef Keith Rhodes. They are accepting monetary donations. Diaper Bank of North Carolina — Founded by parents Michelle and Gregory Old in 2013, the Diaper Bank distributes over 200,000 diapers per month state-wide with branches across North Carolina. They also provide access to basic necessities for families in shelters. They have an Amazon Wishlist asking for children's underwear, toilet paper, feminine products, and diapers. Loaves and Fishes — Based out of Charlotte, N.C., and servicing Mecklenburg County, Loaves and Fishes supplies families experiencing a short-term crisis a week's worth of groceries. The organization reports that, as of Tuesday, it is operating on a regular schedule. The organization is accepting cash donations online and supply donations can be dropped off at any of their pantry locations as well as their warehouse. Feeding the Carolinas — Established in September 2016, Feeding the Carolinas is an alliance of the NC State Association and the SC State Association, representing all nine food banks in the Carolinas plus a food recovery organization. They are working with Feeding America and are accepting donations at local food banks. Otherwise, you can donate monetarily on their website. Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina -- Operating for over 35 years, the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina works with a network of over 800 partners in the state. They're accepting donations at drop off sites within those six towns, as well as monetary donations online. Harvest Hope Food Banks -- This South Carolina organization feeds hungry individuals and families in the Midlands, Pee Dee and greater Greenville regions. They are also working with Feeding America, and refer those who want to donate supplies to their Amazon Wish List. They also accept food and supply donations at various locations, or accept monetary donations online. Local police -- For those within driving distance, police and sheriff's departments in Hurricane Florence affected areas are accepting donations of bottled water, nonperishable food items, cleaning supplies and hygiene items. The South Carolina Law Enforcement Officers' Association has tweeted a list of drop-off locations. Some animal shelters are rescuing and taking in a surplus of animals from areas affected by the storm. Atlanta Humane Society — Staffers have worked with shelters on the Carolina coast, making arrangements to ensure that animals are out of harm's way. They are currently accepting monetary donations, which will be matched until September 30. Coastal Animal Rescue — Coastal Animal Rescue is a no-kill shelter with a veterinary clinic that has taken in dozens of dogs and cats and gave them treatment. "We took in as many as we possibly could, and some are still staying with us now because people can't take them back," said Barbara Cook, a volunteer at Coastal Animal Rescue. Cook mentioned that some of the animals were pets that had been abandoned or left behind by their owners as the storm approached. But, not all animals were able to get out of the path of the storm. Pender County Animal Shelter — In Pender County, floodwaters have overtaken Interstate-40, and the animal shelter has been filling up fast. However, the shelter is required by law to euthanize animals if the number of animals coming in exceeds the space they have to hold them and they cannot find suitable relocation options for the animals. Jewell Horton, the shelter manager, has said that she wants to avoid euthanizing animals, and asked for help. "Unfortunately right now, the infrastructure is so bad because of the storm that we can't accept online payments," she said. Currently, she said that the county is cut off by floodwaters, but she asked people to mail donations, pet food, kennels and other supplies in the hopes that roads will reopen soon. Other shelters helping animals affected by the storm are the Charleston Animal Society, which evacuated over 40 dogs from Myrtle Beach, S.C., Brother Wolf Animal Rescue, the Greenville Humane Society, which has an Amazon wishlist, and the Humane Society of Charlotte. As a result of canceled blood drives in affected states, the American Red Cross is reporting a shortage in the local blood supply and encouraging residents of non-impacted areas in Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia to donate blood. Appointments can be made online. If you are a local or are planning to travel to the Carolinas for relief efforts, you can also donate time. Some of the organizations already listed are accepting volunteers. The state of North Carolina has also set up an online form to enlist volunteers. South Carolina is asking that volunteers not self-deploy and if they wish to assist in relief efforts they sign up through a site maintained by the United Way Association of South Carolina. Finally, for those who want to help but don't have a lot of time to spare, owners of the Amazon Echo smart speaker can say, "Alexa, donate to Hurricane Florence disaster relief," which will send money to the Red Cross, so long as you have a valid payment method in your Amazon account with voice purchasing enabled.
Shy 1 rebound, triple-double watch for Westbrook continues  [SEP]  MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Fans stood on their feet, urging Russell Westbrook to grab the one rebound needed to separate himself from Oscar Robertson and grab an NBA record that has stood for 55 years. Westbrook wound up scoring 45 points, tying his career-high with eight 3-pointers, handing out 10 assists and grabbing just nine rebounds in Oklahoma City’s 103-100 win over Memphis on Wednesday night. So the triple-double watch continues for another game. “Obviously, people came to see that, but it happens like that,” Westbrook said. “We got a lot of games left. We got the win. That’s the most important part to me.” Not to the fans standing throughout the lower bowl in the final minute. Some like 14-year-old Ashton Wyatt of Paragould, Arkansas, came with his family to see both his hero and an NBA record. Kyle Cox, 24, of Memphis has been a Thunder fan since the franchise relocated from Seattle and could hardly sleep Tuesday night after Westbrook tied Robertson’s single-season mark of 41 triple-doubles, set in 1961-62. “It’s incredible, and he’s played his heart out, so I think he deserves it,” said Cox, who bought his tickets for this game two months ago. Instead, fans will have to wait until Friday night when the Thunder visit Phoenix to see if Westbrook notches his 42nd triple-double after a thrilling performance where he scored 11 of Oklahoma City’s final 14 points. “We held him from getting a triple-double,” Memphis coach David Fizdale said. “So take that Russell Westbrook.” Thunder coach Billy Donovan set his own personal mark with his 100th career victory, and the Thunder pushed their lead over Memphis for the No. 6 seed in the West to 3 ½ games. Westbrook’s historic pace was all anyone really wanted to talk about before and after the game. A lifelong basketball fan, Donovan certainly appreciates what his star guard has managed to do this season from his spot on the sideline. “For what Oscar Robertson did back in the ’60s, for that to stand as long as it has, I think really shows how difficult something like that is,” Donovan said. “And I think for Russell, he’s a unique talent that he gets an opportunity every night because of his ability to impact the game in a lot of different ways.” Westbrook already has done so much in a spectacular season: — More triple-doubles this season than 10 NBA teams have in their entire history. — Needs only six more assists over the Thunder’s final four games to join Robertson as the only players in league history to average a triple-double for the season. Robertson averaged 30.8 points, 12.5 rebounds and 11.4 assists for the Cincinnati Royals in 1961-62. For comparison, Karl Malone in 1989-90 was the last player in the NBA to average 30-plus points and 10-plus rebounds in a season, while Tiny Archibald in 1972-73 as the last to average 30-plus points and 10-plus assists for a season. — Trails only Jason Kidd (107), Magic Johnson (138) and Roberson (181) while being tied with Wilt Chamberlain with 78 for his career. Grizzlies swingman Vince Carter, in his 19th NBA season, said Westbrook is “playing out of his mind.” Carter recalled when some suggested Kidd could reach Robertson’s record and remembered a playoff series where Kidd averaged a triple-double over six or seven games. “He’s doing it over the course of the season,” Carter said of Westbrook. “It’s pretty impressive.” If Westbrook can’t reach the milestone at Phoenix, he could also get there on the road at Denver and Minnesota, or when the Thunder close the regular season at home against the Nuggets. “Once the regular season ends and the playoffs start, it’s not a topic of conversation anymore,” Donovan said. “So there’s only six more days of this.”
Plane hits Melbourne mall, all on board presumed dead | Mindanao Examiner Regional Newspaper  [SEP]  Five people were believed killed when a light plane crashed into a shopping mall on Tuesday in the Australian city of Melbourne, officials said. The five were on a twin-engine Beechcraft Super King Air that crashed about 45 minutes before the Direct Factory Outlet mall in suburban Essendon was to open, Police Minister Lisa Neville said. The victims were believed to be US citizens but the US embassy to Australia would not comment on their nationality, only saying it was working with local authorities. “We extend our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of all those who died in today’s tragic crash,” an embassy statement said. “We are unable to confirm any details about the nationality or identity of any of the victims. The US embassy in Canberra and the consulate in Melbourne are working closely with local authorities to assist in any way possible,” it said. Police Assistant Commissioner Stephen Leane also declined to say whether the four passengers were Americans. The plane had taken off from Melbourne’s second-biggest airport at Essendon on a chartered flight to King Island, 255km to the south, officials said. Leane said it appeared that no one aboard the plane had survived. No one on the ground was injured. “Looking at the fireball, it is incredibly lucky that no one was at the back of those stores or in the car park of the stores, that no one was even hurt,” Leane said. A pilot reported a “catastrophic engine failure” moments before the plane crashed into a storage area at the rear of the mall, police said. Police and paramedics rushed to the crash site, where firefighters doused the flames. A witness who gave his name as Jason told Australian Broadcasting Corp. he was passing the mall in a taxi when the plane crashed. “I saw this plane coming in really low and fast. I couldn’t see the impact but when it hit the building there was a massive fireball,” he said. “I could feel the heat through the window of the taxi, and then a wheel – it looked like a plane wheel – bounced on the road and hit the front of the taxi as we were driving along,” he said.(Al Jazeera)
UPDATE 2-Six dead after blast at Czech refinery  [SEP]  PRAGUE, March 22 (Reuters) - An explosion killed six people at a refinery in the Czech Republic on Thursday, rescue officials said. Two other people were taken to hospital with serious injuries, a fire department spokeswoman told Czech Television. The blast occurred at Unipetrol’s plant in Kralupy nad Vltavou about 30 km (19 miles) north of Prague. “There was an explosion at the storage tank but no subsequent fire in the Kralupy refinery,” Unipetrol spokesman Pavel Kaidl said. “The situation is under control and there is no other danger. There was no leakage of dangerous substances.” The mayor of Kralupy told Czech Television the blast occurred during cleaning of the storage tank. Unipetrol had been preparing the refinery for maintenance and an upgrade scheduled to run from March 27 to May 9. The facility has an annual capacity of 3.2 million tonnes of oil. In August 2015, a blast and fire at Unipetrol’s Litvinov facility knocked the refinery out for more than a year. In February, Poland’s PKN Orlen said it had raised its stake in Unipetrol to more than 90 percent from 63 percent, meeting a threshold to take full control and delist the company from the Prague stock exchange.
Ex-Trump campaign adviser sentenced to 14 days in prison  [SEP]  WASHINGTON (AP) — George Papadopoulos, the Trump campaign adviser who triggered the Russia investigation, was sentenced to 14 days in prison Friday after he told a judge he was "deeply embarrassed and ashamed" for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian intermediaries. Papadopoulos, the first campaign aide sentenced in special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing investigation, acknowledged that his actions hindered an investigation of national importance, a move that the judge in his case said resulted in the 31-year-old putting his own self-interest above that of his country. "I made a dreadful mistake, but I am a good man who is eager for redemption," Papadopoulos said. The punishment was far less than the maximum six-month sentence sought by the government but more than the probation that Papadopoulos and his lawyers had asked for. Papadopoulos, who served as a foreign policy adviser to President Donald Trump's campaign, has been a central figure in the Russia investigation dating back before Mueller's May 2017 appointment. He was the first to plead guilty in Mueller's probe and is now the first Trump campaign adviser to be sentenced. His case was also the first to detail a member of the Trump campaign having knowledge of Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election while it was ongoing. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss said Papadopoulos' deception was "not a noble lie" and said he had lied because he wanted a job in the Trump administration and didn't want to jeopardize that possibility by being tied to the Russia investigation. "In some ways it constitutes a calculated exercise of self-interest over the national interest," the judge said. Moss noted that many similar cases resulted in probation but said he imposed a sentence of incarceration partly to send a message to the public that they can't lie to the FBI. The sentence drew a quick response from Trump on Twitter, as he scoffed at the two weeks of prison time by comparing it to an unverified cost figure for the Mueller probe. "14 days for $28 MILLION - $2 MILLION a day, No Collusion. A great day for America!" the president tweeted. Memos authored by House Republicans and Democrats , now declassified, show that information about Papadopoulos' contacts with Russian intermediaries triggered the FBI's counterintelligence investigation in July 2016 into potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. That probe was later taken over by Mueller. According to a sweeping indictment handed up this summer, Russian intelligence had stolen emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign and other Democratic groups by April 2016, the same month Papadopoulos was told by a professor that Russian officials had told him they had "dirt" on Clinton in the form of "thousands of emails." Papadopoulos later used his connections with the Maltese professor, Joseph Mifsud, and other Russian nationals in an attempt to broker a meeting between then-candidate Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He admitted last year to lying to the FBI about those contacts with Russians and Russian intermediaries, false statements that prosecutors say caused irreparable harm to the investigation during its early months. Prosecutors say those false statements, made during a January 2017 interview with federal investigators, led the FBI to miss an opportunity to interview Mifsud while he was in the United States in early 2017. In court Friday, prosecutor Andrew Goldstein said Papadopoulos' cooperation "didn't come close to the standard of substantial assistance." "It was at best begrudging efforts to cooperate and we don't think they were substantial or significant in any regard," he said. He said Papadopoulos' deception required investigators to scour more than 100,000 emails and gigabytes of data to reconstruct the timeline of his contacts with Russians and Russian intermediaries. Even after his arrest and plea agreement last year, Goldstein said, Papadopoulos continued to be difficult, only providing information after being confronted with documents such as emails and text messages. In response, defense lawyer Thomas Breen said his client was "remorseful" that his lies impeded the investigation. Papadopoulos lied because he was torn between wanting to cooperate and wanting to remain loyal to a president whose administration he hoped to join, Breen said. His client was also affected by Trump's cries of "fake news" and his casting of the Russia investigation as a "witch hunt" just days before his FBI interview. "The president of the United States hindered this investigation more than George Papadopoulos ever could," Breen said. Breen described his client as a "patriot," who wasn't trying to help Russia. But he acknowledged that Papadopoulos was unsophisticated, naive and even a "fool" for having made contacts with Russia intermediaries during the campaign. Breen said his client's primary interest was brokering a meeting between Trump and Putin, a move he believed the campaign supported. In court papers, Breen wrote that during a March 2016 meeting attended by Papadopoulos, Trump nodded with approval at the idea, and then-Senator Jeff Sessions "appeared to like" it and said the campaign "should look into it." That clashes with what Sessions, a key campaign aide and now Trump's attorney general, told the House Judiciary Committee last November. In that testimony, Sessions said he resisted the idea of any Russia meeting proposed by Papadopoulos. Outside the courthouse Friday, Breen said Papadopoulos didn't recall ever telling anyone in the campaign about the fact that Russia had dirt on Clinton in the form of emails. Breen also rejected the idea that Papadopoulos was the victim of a witch hunt or prosecutorial misconduct. "We have seen no such thing. We have seen no entrapment. We have seen no set up by U.S. intelligence people," he said, noting that he also had no reason to believe that Papadopoulos was the subject of a warrant obtained under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Asked if Papadopoulos still remained loyal to Trump, Breen smiled wryly and paused for a beat. "We don't talk politics," he said.
Probe as Greece's ambassador to Brazil disappears  [SEP]  Police in Rio de Janeiro are investigating the disappearance of Greece's ambassador to Brazil. Kyriakos Amoiridis was last seen on Monday night, police said, although no specific location has been revealed. Neither Greece's embassy in the capital Brasilia nor the Greek consulate in Rio have replied to requests for information on the ambassador's whereabouts. According to the website of the Greek embassy, Mr Amoiridis started his career as diplomat in 1985 in Athens and became Greece's top diplomat in Brazil in 2016. He was Greece's ambassador to Libya and worked as consul in Rio.
EU orders Ireland to recoup up to €13bn in unpaid taxes from Apple  [SEP]  Ireland has been ordered to recoup up to €13 billion from US tech company Apple in unpaid taxes in a landmark ruling by the European Commission this morning. The EU’s powerful competition arm said on Tuesday that Apple had been granted selective treatment by Ireland through two tax rulings granted to the company in 1991 and 2007 by Irish tax authorities. That treatment allowed Apple to avoid taxation on almost all profits generated by sales of its products in the EU single market, because Apple recorded the sales in Ireland rather than where products were sold, the commission said. This was achieved by funnelling sales through a “so-called” head office in Ireland with “no employees, no premises and no real activities,” commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. In a statement, the commission said it “substantially and artificially” lowered the tax paid by Apple in Ireland since 1991, giving Apple a “significant advantage” over other businesses subject to the same national taxation rules. “Member states cannot give tax benefits to selected companies – this is illegal under EU state aid rules,” said Ms Vestager. “The commission’s investigation concluded that Ireland granted illegal tax benefits to Apple, which enabled it to pay substantially less tax than other businesses over many years. In fact, this selective treatment allowed Apple to pay an effective corporate tax rate of 1 per cent on its European profits in 2003, down to 0.005 per cent in 2014.” Apple said it would appeal and it was confident the decision would be overturned. While the precise figure will be worked out by the Irish Revenue Commissioners, the commission estimates that the total money recovered will amount to about € 13 billion – far in excess of what had been envisaged by Irish authorities. The US treasury said it declined to comment on specific cases, but expressed disappointment that the commission was “acting unilaterally and departing from the important progress the US, the EU, and the rest of the international community have made together to combat tax avoidance”. “As we have said, we believe that retroactive tax assessments by the commission are unfair, contrary to well-established legal principles, and call into question the tax rules of individual member states,” the treasury said in a statement. “The commission’s actions could threaten to undermine foreign investment, the business climate in Europe, and the important spirit of economic partnership between the US and the EU. We will continue to monitor these cases as they progress, and we will continue to work with the commission toward our shared objective of preventing the erosion of our corporate tax bases.” Though the Apple case follows similar cases against Fiat, Amazon, and Starbucks, the total tax liability is by far the largest judgment handed down by the EU’s competition division in relation to a member state’s tax arrangements. In contrast to the multibillion-euro figure proposed, the commission ordered the Netherlands to recover between €20 and €30 million from Starbucks, and Luxembourg to recover the same amount from Fiat. The EU’s powerful anti-trust arm, which typically rules on mergers and acquisitions, has increasingly turned its attention to corporate tax arrangements in recent years, focusing particularly on transfer pricing arrangements. Minister for Finance Michael Noonan is to seek Cabinet approval to appeal the decision to the European courts, a process that is likely to take up to four years. In the interim, Apple will be obliged to pay the tax shortfall to the Irish exchequer. It is expected the money will be held in a frozen account. Reacting to the announcement, Mr Noonan said the decision left him with “no choice” but to appeal the decision. “This is necessary to defend the integrity of our tax system; to provide tax certainty to business; and to challenge the encroachment of EU state aid rules into the sovereign member state competence of taxation.” Today’s findings follow more than three years of investigations by the European Commission into Ireland’s tax arrangements with Apple, since it first sought information from Dublin in June 2013. A year later, the commission launched its investigation, arguing that its preliminary assessment was that Ireland had illegally granted selective treatment to Apple, in breach of EU state aid law. Irish officials insisted on Tuesday that the full amount of tax due by Apple has been paid, arguing that, because most of Apple’s profits were not generated in Ireland, they could not be taxed in Ireland. The kind of “stateless”, non-resident companies that were investigated by the commission have since been phased out by the Irish government, which means that the Apple judgment is unlikely to impact on Apple’s future tax arrangements in Ireland. Much of the commission’s investigation focused on how Irish Revenue officials calculated “transfer pricing” arrangements for Apple in two separate tax rulings offered to the company. Also known as advance pricing arrangements, transfer pricing governs how transactions between different entities of a corporation are priced, a process that can have implications for profit allocation and the company’s tax bill. The commission believes that the Revenue Commissioners did not apply the proper “arm’s length principle” when calculating the transfer pricing arrangements for Apple. But officials briefed on the matter believe that because transfer pricing is notoriously difficult to price – the OECD outlines five different methodologies for calculating transfer pricing – the commission’s case can be tested in court. However, minutes from meetings between Apple and the Revenue Commissioners in 1990 and 1991 supplied by Revenue to the European Commission as part of the investigation show how a transfer pricing figure was negotiated between the two parties. The commission has argued that this arrangement was motivated by employment considerations. MEP Brian Hayes said credibility of the business environment in Ireland, along with its ability to attract foreign direct investment here, was on the line, and the taxation system should not be targeted for reasons of “anti-American bias”. He accused the commission of overstepping its role and mandate, and said the ultimate decision in this case must be taken by the European Court of Justice. “It’s in Ireland’s long-term interest that the Government appeals this,” he said “The figure of €13 billion shows just how politically motivated this decision was. This was a clear statement that the commission wanted to hit US multinationals hard with this announcement.” Oxfam Ireland chief executive Jim Clarken called on the Government to shut down tax loopholes and reassure citizens that “sweetheart deals” with companies or individuals are a thing of the past. “Ireland has benefited from multinational investment but all companies should operate here under rules which are fair and which do not benefit some companies over others,” he said. “Deals that exempt companies from paying their legitimate share of tax mean the ordinary taxpayers have to foot the bill. Today’s announcement comes a week after a US treasury White Paper strongly criticised the European Commission’s recent investigations into the tax affairs of US multinationals. The issue has soured EU-US relations, amid accusations from Washington that Brussels is unfairly targeting US companies, a charge the European Commission denies. The commission’s findings mark the latest move by the European Commission to clamp down on corporate tax avoidance, a priority prompted by revelations such as the Luxembourg Leaks and Panama Papers scandals. A revised proposal on a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB), to which Ireland has traditionally been opposed, is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
Pacquiao KOs Matthysse to win WBA title  [SEP]  Manny Pacquiao produced a dominant display to stun Lucas Matthysse with a seventh round knockout and claim the WBA welterweight title. The Filipino boxing legend looked focused and busy from the opening bell and had the 15,000 fans at the Axiata Arena on their feet when he sent his Argentine opponent to the canvas three times with an array of clubbing blows. The southpaw dropped Matthysse for the final time with a brutal uppercut and the win. He hailed Pacquiao as a "great legend" and said he will take a break after his loss. "This is part of boxing. You win some, you lose some," Matthysse said. It was Pacquiao's first victory inside the distance since 2009 and improves the eight-division world champion's record to 60-7-2. The 39-year-old rebounded from his disappointing loss last year to Australian Jeff Horn and his victory could extend his boxing career that had taken a back seat to his political life as a Filipino senator. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad also attended the fight, the biggest boxing match in the country since 1975 heavyweight clash between Muhammad Ali and Australian Joe Bugner.
Villanova wins national championship in dominating fashion, thwarting Michigan"s late run with back-to-back 3s and a wink  [SEP]  • Villanova won its second men's basketball title in three years with a dominating win over Michigan in the NCAA Tournament championship game. • The third-seeded Wolverines looked strong early, but after they took an early lead, it was nearly all Wildcats over the final 30 minutes. • Michigan did make a mini-run in the second half, but the star of the game, Donte DiVincenzo, quickly put an end to that with back-to-back 3-pointers and a wink. Villanova has won the NCAA men's basketball championship for the second time in three years, and it did it in dominating fashion, 79-62, on Monday night. Things looked good early for Michigan as the Wolverines jumped out to a 21-14 lead midway through the first half. But over the next 20 minutes, Villanova outscored Michigan 37-12. Michigan tried to fight its way back in, pulling within 12 after going on a modest 11-5 run with under 10 minutes to play. But Nova quickly answered with back-to-back 3-pointers by Donte DiVincenzo that erupted the Wildcats' fan base and seemed to take the air out of the Wolverines and their fans. DiVincenzo, who finished with 31 points off the bench, even had a Michael Jordan-like wink for somebody at the broadcast table after the second dagger. All that was left was the celebration.
S.Korea's Moon says analysing N.Korea missile, could have been ICBM  [SEP]  South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said on Tuesday the military is analysing a North Korean missile launched earlier in the day with the possibility that it may have been an intercontinental ballistic missile-class (ICBM) rocket. Moon said in opening remarks at a national security council meeting at the Blue House that he was deeply disappointed North Korea had launched the missile only days after he and U.S. President Donald Trump called for restraint. The South Korean president added he strongly condemned the missile launch that violates United Nations Security Council resolutions and ignores international warnings.

Photos and video emerges of tense standoff between police and eco-activists in France as violence flares for 2nd day --  [SEP]  Violence is flaring in western France for the second day as police attempt to raze an anarchist commune on the site of an abandoned airport.Law enforcement officials were mobilized for evictions in Notre-Dame-des-Landes commune, 20km from the city of Nantes on Monday. Some 250 activists occupied the 1,650-hectare site, once reserved for a proposed airport, calling it their "Zone a Defendre" (Zone to be Defended).On Tuesday, tensions continued with Molotov cocktails flying through clouds of tear gas, local media reported. The protesters set up barricades made of tires and electricity poles in an effort to keep the police at bay."Things are going to be more complicated [on Tuesday], the Pays-de-la-Loire regional prefect said, adding that on Monday police deployed some 2,500 officers to evict the camp residents.RT's Charlotte Dubenskij and the Ruptly crew were caught up in the action amid the standoff between police officers and eco-squatters.Environmental activists have protested against the construction of the airport in Notre-Dame-des-Landes since 2008. Supporters of the project argued it would boost economic development in Pays-de-la-Loire, while opponents claimed it was too environmentally unfriendly.After long debates, French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced in January that France would abandon the project."This is the logical decision given the dead-end in which this project has found itself," Philippe stated. Authorities later ordered the activists to evacuate the area by March 31 or otherwise face eviction.
Ethnic clashes in northeastern Congo kill more than 40 people  [SEP]  GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo, March 2 (Reuters) - E thnic clashes between Hema herders and Lendu farmers in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo's Ituri province have killed more than 40 people, local officials said on Friday, in the second such incident in a month. Tensions between the two groups have largely laid dormant since a 1998-2003 war, when thousands died in fighting between the two groups, but have flared again in recent months due to disputes over land. At least 30 people were killed in two days of clashes last month between armed Hema and Lendu. Militia activity has increased across eastern Congo's borderlands with Uganda and Rwanda in the past year, stoked in part by President Joseph Kabila's refusal to step down at the end of his constitutional mandate in December 2016. Alfred Ndrabu, a member of the Catholic church's Justice and Peace Commission in Ituri, said a colleague in the village of Maze had counted 49 bodies from Thursday's clashes, which continued into Friday morning. "The Lendu and their allies attacked the village of Maze," Ndrabu told Reuters. "They were pushed back by security forces ... They returned with reinforcements ... which was when they perpetrated the carnage." Jean-Bosco Lalo, an activist based in the provincial capital of Bunia, said his organisation, had so far recorded 43 deaths. He did not say who had initiated the violence. "It was a case of reprisals by the two communities," said local army spokesman Jules Ngongo, who did not yet have a death toll. "According to our information, there were cases of people being decapitated." Millions of people died during conflicts in Ituri and elsewhere in eastern Congo around the turn of the century, mostly from hunger and disease. Three warlords from Ituri have been tried by the International Criminal Court - and two of them convicted - for their roles in those conflicts. Another is currently on trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity. (Additional reporting by Amedee Mwarabu Writing by Aaron Ross Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg)
Who will get the Literature Nobel this year?  [SEP]  In the 115 years since its inception, the Prize has gone to just 14 women. In the last three years, Japanese author Haruki Murakami’s name was thrown around when the Nobel Prize date was announced. The name came up more due to bookmaker Ladbrokes' yearly betting list, which usually has the top 10 contenders, at least according to the betting world, for the most coveted prize in literature. Of course, the constant clamour of the author's fans adds to the attention every year. This year too, Murakami’s name has cropped up in the top 10 of Ladbrokes' list. Touted as a favourite by Ladbrokes, he is only upstaged by Kenyan Ngugi Wa Thiong'o. American Don DeLillo too has jumped up in the stakes, right behind Syrian poet Adunis. Another favourite, Philip Roth, is currently in the fifth position. Murakami or DeLillo not winning the Nobel until now is not surprising. After all, this is the prize that had famously ignored Tolstoy, Ibsen, James Joyce, Henry James and even Cormac Mc Carthy, not to mention the countless non-English writers who have been overlooked. American fans have long accused the Prize of ignoring their writers, when in fact, their country has the second highest number of laureates. If the Prize could be accused of anything, it could be Anglo- and Euro-centricism. For not all great writing is in English or originates in France, which has the most number of laureates. But, if a group that has consistently been ignored, it is women. In the 115 years since its inception, the Nobel Prize in Literature has gone to just 14 women. It is still a higher number of women awardees than any other Nobel Prize has had so far. This year too, no woman writer’s name is in the reckoning, even at Ladbrokes, the only exception being Joyce Carol Oates. She too isn’t in the top 10. Even Bob Dylan beat her there, and he isn’t even primarily a writer. Last year’s award to Svetlana Alexeivich was a shock win, and perhaps more such wins are needed to even the score.
England vs Colombia: Match preview, prediction and facts  [SEP]  Gareth Southgate's men take on an exciting Colombian outfit for a place in the quarter-final at the Spartak Stadium in Moscow. They meet tomorrow in what will be the eighth knockout tie of the World Cup. England were shockingly eliminated in the group stages in the last World Cup but till now have done enough to convince their fans to dream of the World Cup finals. Colombia have not impressed but they have the team to beat England on their day. Dele Alli is fit for the match and might feature in the starting XI. Ruben Loftus-Cheek has performed well in the last two games. But the extra experience and potency of the Tottenham Hotspur man should see him get the nod. He has scored five goals from just two games and holds the key to England's success. If he is able to take England to the final, he will surely end up as the golden boot winner. He missed a few chances against Tunisia in England's first group match but displayed a sublime performance against Panama. He holds the key for England to create chances. His driving runs will be really crucial against shaky Colombian backline. England's fans will be hoping that 'Messi' Lingard continues his good run of form. England required an injury time goal from Harry Kane to get all the three points against Tunisia but completely dominated their second game against Panama. Southgate decided to play his reserve team against Belgium which became the cause of their first defeat in this World Cup. Colombia will monitor the fitness of star midfielder James Rodriguez, who hobbled out of the previous match against Senegal. Qunitero scored a clever goal from a free-kick, whereas Falcao also scored his first ever goal in the World Cup. Midfielder Abel Aguilar missed their last game with a muscle problem but has trained normally in the build-up to this match and is expected to be available. From barely featuring for Barcelona last season, Yerry Mina has risen to the occasion and remained solid in defence and also scored some important goals, while Radamel Falcao is finally beginning to enjoy playing at a World Cup. Mina's primary responsibility will be to remain tight in defence and give no space to Harry Kane to shoot or run. The Colombian striker will have to be as clinical as he can get against England. He will not get many chances to score against a solid defence pair of Harry Maguire and John Stones. Had a poor start to the World Cup campaign when they got beaten by Japan but showed good character to defeat Poland with a heavy scoreline of 3-0. Quintero has been in good form and will have the responsibility to create chances if James Rodriguez is not able to recover in time. Their experienced striker will have the responsibility to score goals especially after getting his first World Cup goal in the group match. England is unbeaten against Colombia in five previous meetings. Michael Owen scored a hat-trick when they last played, which England won 3-2 in New Jersey in 2005. The Three Lions beat Colombia 2-0 in their only previous World Cup encounter thanks to goals from Darren Anderton and David Beckham in the group stage of the 1998 tournament. If Kane finds the net against Colombia, he will become the first player to score in six consecutive appearances for the Three Lions since Tommy Lawton back in 1939. England will be favourites heading into this game, especially if Harry Kane can keep up his scoring record so far at the tournament.
Bolton meets with SKorea, Japan national security advisers  [SEP]  WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s new national security adviser held talks Thursday with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts, as the U.S. gears up for an unprecedented summit with North Korea. John Bolton met with Chung Eui-yong, the South Korean official who last month announced outside the White House Trump’s surprise decision to meet with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un. The summit is slated for May or June. South Korea’s president is due to meet Kim this month. Bolton met separately Thursday with Shotaro Yachi of Japan whose prime minister will meet Trump at the White House on Tuesday. A spokesman at the National Security Council says Chung and Yachi are the first national security advisers to meet with Bolton since he took office on Monday.
Man who confessed to 90 murders says 2 of them happened in St. Louis area  [SEP]  ST. LOUIS — The man who has confessed to 90 murders from coast to coast says he committed two of the crimes in the St. Louis area. Samuel Little is suspected in dozens of deaths. The 78-year-old is sitting in a Texas jail and has confessed to 90 murders so far, according to the Texas Rangers. The FBI is working with law enforcement agencies all over the U.S. in an attempt to match up his confessions with actual cases. Little said his murder spree started in the 1970 and didn’t stop until 2005. Two of the murders he confessed to are in the Metro East area—in East St. Louis and Granite City, Illinois. Little said between 1976 and 1979 he met a 26-year-old woman in St. Louis. Her name might have been “Jo” he told FBI agents. Little said he killed her in Granite City. Little said he also killed another woman during that three-year span. Again, he said he met her in St. Louis, but killed her across the river in East St. Louis. So far, law enforcement agencies have not been able to verify either of these confessions. READ MORE: New details emerge in Angie Housman murder case The FBI did confirm, however, that Little served time for assaulting a woman in Missouri, but didn't specify when he was imprisoned in the state or for how long. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said Samuel Little, convicted in 2014 of three killings, confessed to 90 murders dating back to 1970 in exchange for moving to a new prison. Authorities have corroborated 34 of the killings with several others awaiting confirmation, according to a statement from the FBI. If all his confessions are confirmed, he could be among the most prolific serial killers in U.S. history. Click here for the FBI's full list of confessions and an interactive map "Law enforcement has only recently begun unraveling the true extent of his crimes," said the FBI's statement. The FBI is working with Texas Rangers, the Department of Justice, and multiple state and local law enforcement agencies to corroborate Little's confessions. Little, 78, was arrested in 2012 in a shelter in Kentucky, then extradited to California on a narcotics charge. Los Angeles police obtained a DNA match to Little on three unsolved murders in the area in 1987 and 1989 and was charged with three counts of murder. In 2014, he was sentenced to three consecutive life sentences without parole. As Little was awaiting trial in Los Angeles, authorities in at least nine other states began scouring cold case files to see if Little may be connected. According to the FBI's statement, Little confessed to killings in 16 states — including Florida, Tennessee, Ohio, Louisiana and Mississippi — during an interview in May with Texas Ranger James Holland. "He went through city and state and gave Ranger Holland the number of people he killed in each place. Jackson, Mississippi — one; Cincinnati, Ohio — one; Phoenix, Arizona — three; Las Vegas, Nevada, — one," said Christina Palazzolo, a crime analyst with the FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension Program, in a statement released Tuesday.
Strasbourg Christmas market gunman shot dead by French police  [SEP]  STRASBOURG - The gunman who killed three people at a Christmas market in Strasbourg was shot dead by French police on Thursday as the Islamic State jihadist group claimed him as one of its "soldiers". More than 700 French security forces had been hunting for 29-year-old Cherif Chekatt since the bloodshed on Tuesday night, the latest in a string of jihadist attacks to rock France. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said three police tried to question Chekatt after spotting him on the street in the Neudorf area of the northeastern French city where he grew up, but he opened fire. "They immediately returned fire and neutralised the assailant," Castaner said. A source close to the investigation said a woman spotted a man fitting Chekatt's description with a wounded arm on Thursday afternoon and alerted authorities, who sealed off the area and used a helicopter with thermal cameras to hunt for the suspect. People gathered at the police cordon where Chekatt was shot and applauded, some shouting "bravo!", a source said. "It's really a huge relief," said Alain Fontanel, a local official in the mayor's office, describing the anxiety that locals had felt since Tuesday's attack. "We didn't really feel very safe," one 18-year-old local named Arthur told AFP. The propaganda wing of the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack. The perpetrator of "the attack in the city of Strasbourg... is one of the soldiers of the Islamic State and carried out the operation in response to calls to target nationals of the coalition" against IS, the Amaq agency said in a message posted on Twitter. Chekatt, who lived in a rundown apartment block a short drive from the city centre, was flagged by French security forces in 2015 as a possible Islamic extremist. France has been hit by a wave of attacks from people claiming allegiance to al-Qaeda or IS since 2015, which have claimed the lives of nearly 250 people, according to an AFP toll. It is also not the first time a Christmas market has been targeted in Europe. In 2016, a jihadist attacked a Christmas market in Berlin and went on the run through the Netherlands and France before being shot and killed three days later in northern Italy. Defiant local authorities insisted the Strasbourg Christmas market would reopen as usual on Friday. Chekatt was believed to have been wounded after exchanging fire with soldiers during the attack, but managed to escape and had not been seen since fleeing the scene on Tuesday. Police in several other countries had joined the hunt for the career criminal with at least 27 convictions in four European states. Officers who had already detained Chekatt's parents and two brothers on Wednesday took a fifth person into custody for questioning on Thursday. French President Emmanuel Macron thanked security forces in a tweet and vowed: "Our commitment against terrorism is total." He earlier expressed "the solidarity of the whole country" towards the victims. "It is not only France that has been hit... but a great European city as well," he added, referring to the seat of the European parliament in the eastern French city that lies on the border with Germany. Strasbourg's location in the heart of western Europe means that Germany, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg can be easily reached by car or train, making the search for Chekatt more complicated. Swiss police had reinforced border checks, while German authorities also widely published the photo of the suspect, which showed him with dark hair, a short beard and a mark on his forehead. As police hunted Chekatt, the French government urged "yellow vest" protesters angry over French economic reforms not to hold another round of demonstrations this weekend, given the strain on the country's security forces. Government spokesperson Benjamin Griveaux called on the anti-government protesters to be "reasonable" after nearly four weeks of often violent demonstrations that have led the government to offer a range of financial relief to low earners. "Our security forces have been deployed extensively these past few weeks," Griveaux told CNews television. "It would be better if everyone could go about their business calmly on Saturday, before the year-end celebrations with their families, instead of demonstrating and putting our security forces to work once again." The yellow-vest protesters, known for their fluorescent high-visibility jackets, had called for a fifth round of protests this Saturday. The protests began on 17 November over fuel tax increases, but snowballed into a revolt over living standards as well as Macron's perceived indifference to the problems of ordinary citizens.
Roche's Tecentriq boosts survival in triple-negative breast cancer  [SEP]  ZURICH/MUNICH (Reuters) - An immunotherapy cocktail from Roche helped slow a type of breast cancer where new treatments have proven elusive, data released on Saturday showed, offering positive news for the Swiss drugmaker as it chases medicines produced by its rivals. Women with advanced triple-negative breast cancer lived a median 7.2 months without their disease worsening (PFS) with Roche’s Tecentriq plus chemotherapy as an initial treatment, compared with 5.5 months for those getting chemotherapy alone. Overall survival (OS) data from the IMpassion 130 study is not yet mature, but Roche Chief Medical Officer Sally Horning told Reuters she had reason for optimism. Patients getting the Tecentriq cocktail lived a median 21.3 months, so far, compared to 17.6 months for those on chemotherapy, she said. Horning said these results offered new hope for people struggling with a difficult disease where patients and doctors desperately need new treatment options. “It’s really extraordinary to see a survival benefit of any kind in triple-negative breast cancer,” she said. “We’re quite excited about the degree of effect.” Tecentriq’s benefit was greater among the roughly 40 percent of triple-negative breast cancer patients in its study whose tumors had high levels of a protein known as PD-L1, that helps tumors avoid immune system detection, Horning added. Interim OS data for that group showed patients lived a median of 25 months, compared to just 15.5 months on chemotherapy. Roche has filed with regulators for approval. Triple-negative tumors, which affect 15 percent of breast cancer patients, have no hormone receptors or HER2 receptors, so patients do not benefit from hormone therapy or HER2-targeting drugs like Roche’s $7 billion-per-year blockbuster Herceptin or GlaxoSmithKline’s Tykerb. Roche in July announced the 902-patient study had showed Tecentriq to chemotherapy boosted outcomes, but the specific data was released at the European Society for Medical Oncology’s annual conference in Munich on Saturday. [nL8N1TY0IQ] With Roche’s Tecentriq trailing immunotherapies from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb in the main form of lung cancer, Chief Executive Severin Schwan is pursuing smaller but still lucrative treatment areas where he can gain an approval head start. So far, Tecentriq’s sales are up 50 percent over the first nine months to 524 million Swiss francs ($528 million), but that is a fraction of sales generated by blockbuster checkpoint inhibitors from Merck’s Keytruda and Bristol’s Opdivo. Triple-negative breast cancer offers an opportunity, as does small cell lung cancer, where Roche also has a chance to be first to win the blessings of the regulators. [nL8N1WB4M8] “Roche has more of a niche approach and is seeking to have clearly defined markets with dedicated studies,” Gregoire Biollaz, fund manager at Pictet Asset Management, told Reuters. Roche, the biggest maker of cancer drugs, needs Tecentriq to be a success. Roche’s three biggest cancer drugs Avastin, Herceptin and Rituxan earn $21 billion in annual sales, but patent expirations are already exposing them to competition from cheaper copies made by rivals. Rivals are also pressing on with cancer drug development. Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb are testing their own immunotherapy combinations against triple-negative disease, including with partners.
Sporadic Clashes Erupt In Mosul A Day After Iraq's Prime Minister Declared 'Total Victory' Over Islamic State Group  [SEP]  MOSUL, Iraq (AP) — Sporadic clashes erupted in Mosul on Tuesday, a day after Iraq’s prime minister declared “total victory” over the Islamic State group, with several airstrikes hitting the Old City neighborhood that was the scene of the fierce battle’s final days. Plumes of smoke rose into the air as IS mortar shells landed near Iraqi positions and heavy gunfire could be heard on the western edge of the Old City. At times heavy, the clashes underscored the dangers still posed by the militants after Iraqi forces announced they retook full control of Mosul, the country’s second-largest city, three years after it was seized by extremists bent on building a global caliphate. Meanwhile, Amnesty International warned in a report released Tuesday that the conflict in Mosul has created a “civilian catastrophe,” with the extremists carrying out forced displacement, summary killings and using civilians as human shields. The report also detailed violations by Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led coalition. “The scale and gravity of the loss of civilian lives during the military operation to retake Mosul must immediately be publicly acknowledged at the highest levels of government in Iraq and states that are part of the U.S.-led coalition,” said Lynn Maalouf, the research director for Mideast at Amnesty. The report, which covers the first five months of this year, noted how IS fighters moved civilians with them around the city, preventing them from escaping, creating battle spaces with dense civilian populations while “Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led coalition failed to adapt their tactics.” The Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led coalition “continued to use imprecise, explosive weapons with wide area effects in densely populated urban environments,” Amnesty stated, adding that some violations may constitute war crimes. On Monday evening, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi came to Mosul for the second day in a row to declare “total victory,” flanked by his senior military leadership at a small base on the edge of the Old City. But he also alluded to the brutality of the conflict, saying the triumph had been achieved “by the blood of our martyrs.” In Geneva, the U.N. human rights chief urged Iraq’s government to ensure that human rights will be respected in post-IS Mosul. Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein described Mosul’s fall as the “turning point” in the conflict against IS, but warned the group continues to subject people to “daily horrors” in its remaining strongholds of Tal Afar, west of Mosul, and Hawijah, north of Baghdad. “Horrific though the crimes of ISIL are, there is no place for vengeance,” said Zeid, who is a Jordanian prince, using an alternative acronym for the Islamic State group. He cited allegations of threats of collective punishment and forced evictions in Mosul by Iraqi security forces and their allies. He also cited three years of rights violations during IS’ control of Mosul, including abuses like sexual slavery of women and girls that “have left deep scars on Iraqi society.” In Baghdad, Shiite politician Karim al-Nouri warned that defeating IS in Mosul doesn’t mean that “terrorism” is finished and urged the government to review its policies for dealing with Sunni areas of the country to “avoid previous mistakes that led to the emergence” of IS. The government needs to work on “removing fears of marginalization and terrorism affiliation in Sunni areas,” said al-Nouri, a senior member of Badr Organization. He said he believes the Iraqi security forces should stay in Mosul until it is fully secure, before handing over to local forces. Lawmaker Intisar al-Jabouri from Nineveh province, where Mosul is the capital, said that uprooting IS’ “extremism ideology” was key for a peaceful future in Mosul, which reeled under the extremists’ harsh rule for three years. She urged Baghdad to invest in “good relations” between the residents and the security forces and take all “necessary measures to prevent terrorism groups from returning to Mosul.” While Mosul fell to the Islamic State group in a matter of days in 2014, the campaign to retake the city, which began last October, has lasted nearly nine months. For more than two years before the operation started, Iraqi forces backed by coalition airstrikes slowly clawed back territory from IS elsewhere in Iraq, and tens of thousands of Iraqi troops went through a massive coalition training program. The IS defeat in Mosul dealt a huge blow to the group’s so-called Islamic “caliphate” — territory that the militants seized, spanning large swaths of both Iraq and Syria — but also killed thousands, left entire neighborhoods in ruins and displaced nearly 900,000 from their homes. Thousands of civilians are estimated to have been killed in the fight for the city, according to the provincial council of Nineveh, where Mosul is the capital — a toll that does not include those still believed buried under collapsed buildings. Iraq’s military does not release official casualty numbers for soldiers killed in combat. A statement late Monday from IS claimed its fighters were still attacking Iraqi soldiers in the al-Maydan area of Mosul’s Old City, purportedly killing and wounding many and seizing weapons and ammunition. “The soldiers of the caliphate in Mosul continue to accomplish epics until they achieve either victory or martyrdom,” it said. Also Monday, the United Nations said that of the more than 897,000 people displaced from Mosul, thousands will probably not be able to return because of “extensive damage caused during the conflict.” “Make no mistake, this victory alone does not eliminate ISIS, and there’s still a tough fight ahead,” Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the top U.S. commander in Iraq said in a recorded video from Baghdad following al-Abadi’s statement. ISIS is another acronym for IS, also referred to as Daesh, an Arabic name. “The coalition will continue to support our Iraqi partners until ISIS is defeated in Iraq,” Townsend added, calling on Iraqis to unite and prevent a return of the conditions that allowed the extremists’ rise more than three years ago.
'You were the devil incarnate' - Judge sentences former UK coach to 30 years jail for abusing young footballers  [SEP]  A former English youth soccer coach was jailed Monday for 30 years for abusing 12 young footballers after the judge called him the "devil incarnate." former English football coach and recruiter Barry Bennell appears in a Duval County courtroom in Jacksonville in 1995. Barry Bennell, a former coach at Crewe and scout for Manchester City, was convicted at Liverpool Crown Court of 50 child sexual offences committed between 1979 and 1991. "Your behaviour towards these boys in grooming and seducing them before subjecting them to, in some cases, the most most serious, degrading and humiliating abuse was sheer evil," Judge Clement Goldstone told the 64-year-old Bennell. Bennell looked at the floor and nodded as the judge sentenced him. Some members of the public began to applaud as he was sent down, but were stopped by the judge. Goldstone said Bennell had appeared to his victims as a God. "In reality, you were the devil incarnate," the judge added. "You stole their childhoods and their innocence to satisfy your own perversion." Goldstone said Bennell's abuse had destroyed the enthusiasm his victims had for playing football and had led to them suffering problems including suicidal thoughts, alcoholism and depression. Bennell has already served three jail terms, totaling 15 years, for similar offences involving 16 other victims in England and the United States.
Trump: Don’t call unless the barbarians are at the gates  [SEP]  As the inauguration of Donald Trump as 45th president of the United States draws unavoidably nearer, the world is undoubtedly looking at his benchmark first 100 days in office with trepidation. His unpredictability is the only thing predictable in Trump’s neophyte political repertoire, often tweeted in 140 characters or fewer and just as often incendiary to the Washington establishment. Trump’s latest affront to the power players was his tossing aside of daily security briefings, telling the American public that once a week would suffice, and that if the fan was suddenly hit with a crisis, he was just down the hall. In other words, he had better things to do than sit through tedious daily briefings that drone on in a loop tape of security techno-babble with very little that is new or pressing. Anyone who has been in government, and tapped into high-level lines of communication, knows this to be largely true. There is no question, however, that Trump’s first 100 days has already begun, because he is laying out what has his silks in a twist, providing ample warning of what he wants to see changed. Earlier this week, for example, he slammed another major defence contractor, this time Lockheed Martin, for its cost overruns in the F-35 fighter jet program. Canada should take note of this clarion call. “The F-35 program and cost is out of control,” tweeted Trump. “Billions of dollars can be saved on military purchases after Jan. 20.” This had Lockheed Martin scrambling its jets, and explaining it was spending millions in research in order to cut costs. Score it as a direct hit for Trump. On the Russian front, Trump dismisses as “ridiculous” reports from anonymous CIA sources, without released evidence, that Russia somehow interfered in the president election in his favour. Naturally, he did it with another tweet. “Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia-CIA card?” asked Trump. “It would be called conspiracy theory.” This was preceded by a statement from Trump’s team that slagged the CIA for being the “same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.” So much for friendly relations between the next president and America’s spy agency. Not to let Russian matters rest, or the news die down, Trump wound up his critics even more on Tuesday by naming Exxon Mobile CEO Rex Tillerson, another non-politico but with strong ties to the Kremlin, as his secretary of state. Again, he did it with a tweet. More gas was poured on the enflamed media Monday when Russian spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stood up at a Moscow press conference and praised the then-potential appointment of Tillerson, who was honoured with the communist country’s friendship award in 2013 for his business dealings in the oil-gas sector. But, as Peskov warned, “There is a big difference between being secretary of state, and being head of a (large) company.” So the game’s already well afoot. Inauguration day, Jan. 20, is just 35 days away.
The 'crazy' threats of Boris Johnson  [SEP]  We now have the full house. Michael Gove has described Theresa May’s plan for a post-Brexit customs partnership as “bonkers.” Jacob Rees-Mogg has called it “cretinous” and now Boris Johnson has labelled it “crazy.” The language may be that of the playground (a point Nicky Morgan made at the weekend) but it points to a mountain of trouble for the Prime Minister. Johnson, of course, has been here before only to back down. Remember when he said Brussels could “go whistle” for its divorce bill? Theresa May may conclude the Brexiteers have cried wolf once too often . But the passions within the Tory ranks have warmed with the unseasonably hot May weather and there is a growing sense the row over customs could be the issue on which Johnson finally snaps. Certainly, given the strength of his opposition to the proposed customs partnership, it is difficult to see how he can retreat if Mrs May decides to persevere with the scheme. And then what? Would he and other Brexiteers resign? And if so, does he have the numbers to make the ballot paper? On one issue Mr Johnson is right. The customs partnership does not adequately resolve the Irish border question. But nor does his preferred option of maximum facilitation. Which is why both have been rejected by Brussels. The EU27 must be looking on and wondering at the sheer amateurism of a Government that charged at full throttle into Brexit without any preparation, incapable of a collective stance and only the faintest of ideas of what the end goal would be. This afternoon the world could become a more dangerous place. Despite the pleading from Emmanuel Macron, Angela Merkel and Theresa May, at 7pm UK time Donald Trump is expected to announce he is effectively collapsing the Iran nuclear deal. It is not entirely clear why the US president dislikes the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action that brought Iran in from the cold beyond the fact it was the signature work of Barack Obama. Which may be why the heads of state are struggling to convince Trump of the sanctity of the deal – this isn’t a rational decision, it’s an emotional one based on low sentiments. In this regard sending Boris Johnson to play the court jester on Fox News in a last ditch attempt to appeal to the President is not entirely senseless. It may be demeaning to have to indulge in Trump’s reality TV style of politics but Johnson does not have much dignity left to lose and if it had swayed the president then the ultimate good was more than worth the price. Despite Benjamin Netanyahu’s theatrics last week the Iran deal is working. Tehran’s nuclear programme is now the most heavily monitored in the world and the inspectors insist it is abiding by the conditions. The key question for the Trump administration is if you are going to sabotage a successful piece of diplomacy then what are you going to put in its place? So far, there has been no answer. 9.45am Ross McEwan the boss of RBS is grilled by the Scottish Affairs committee on bank closures. 11am – Backbench debate led by Labour MP Ann Coffey on children missing from care homes. 2.30pm – Immigration minister Caroline Nokes is quizzed by the Home Affairs committee on immigration and detention.

Serbia talks up armed intervention as Kosovo OKs new army  [SEP]  Serbia talks up armed intervention as Kosovo OKs new army PRISTINA, Kosovo (AP) — Serbia threatened a possible armed intervention in Kosovo after the Kosovo parliament on Friday overwhelmingly approved the formation of an army. Belgrade called the move a "direct threat to peace and stability" in the Balkans and lashed out at the United States for supporting it. While NATO's chief called the action by Kosovo "ill-timed," the U.S. approved it as "Kosovo's sovereign right" as an independent nation that unilaterally broke away from Serbia in 2008. All 107 lawmakers present in the 120-seat Kosovo parliament voted in favor of passing three draft laws to expand an existing 4,000 Kosovo Security Force and turn it into a regular, lightly armed army. Ethnic Serb lawmakers boycotted the vote. Serbia insists the new army violates a U.N. resolution that ended Serbia's bloody crackdown on Kosovar separatists in 1998-1999. It has warned bluntly that it may respond with an armed intervention in its former province, with Prime Minister Ana Brnabic saying that's "one of the options on the table." On Friday, Nikola Selakovic, an adviser to the Serbian president, said the country could send in armed forces or declare Kosovo an occupied territory. Serbian Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic said Serbia will seek an urgent session of the U.N. Security Council over the issue. The Security Council held closed consultations late Friday on the format of a meeting, possibly on Monday or Tuesday. Council diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity because talks were private, said Russia, a close ally of Serbia, wants an open meeting to be addressed by Serbia's president while European nations want a closed session. The decision will be made by Ivory Coast's U.N. ambassador, the current council president, the diplomats said. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres affirmed the U.N.'s desire to maintain the Kosovo Force as the body that ensures the safety of Kosovo, U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said late Friday. He said "the secretary-general calls on all parties concerned to exercise restraint and refrain from actions that could raise tensions and cause a further setback in the European Union-facilitated dialogue for the normalization of relations between Belgrade and Pristina." Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic visited Serbian troops near the border with Kosovo and later Vucic addressed the nation, denouncing the United States for its apparent support of a Kosovo army and praising allies Russia and China for their opposition to the move. He said that Kosovo and its "sponsor" — the U.S. — want to "quash" the Serbs, but that he won't allow it. Vucic says Serbia has been "brought to the edge" by Kosovo's decision and now has no choice but to "defend" itself. It was one of the strongest anti-American outbursts by Vucic, a former pro-Russian ultranationalist turned alleged pro-EU reformer. Any Serbian armed intervention in Kosovo would mean a direct confrontation with thousands of NATO-led peacekeepers, including U.S. soldiers, who have been stationed in Kosovo since 1999. Russia denounced the move to form a Kosovo army, saying the ethnic Albanian force must be "disbanded" by NATO in Kosovo. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, a move not recognized by Belgrade or Russia. Tensions have remained high between the two sides, and NATO and the European Union — which has led yearslong talks to improve ties between the Balkan neighbors — expressed regret that Kosovo decided to go ahead with the army formation. "I reiterate my call on both Pristina and Belgrade to remain calm and refrain from any statements or actions which may lead to escalation," NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said. He said the alliance remains committed "to a safe and secure environment in Kosovo and to stability in the wider Western Balkans." He said they will "re-examine the level of NATO's engagement with the Kosovo Security Force." The new army will preserve its current name — Kosovo Security Force — but now has a new mandate. In about a decade the army expects to have 5,000 troops and 3,000 reservists, and a 98 million-euro ($111 million) annual budget. It will handle crisis response and civil protection operations — essentially what the current paramilitary force, which is lightly armed, does. Its main tasks would be search and rescue, explosive ordnance disposal, firefighting and hazardous material disposal. It's not immediately clear how much more equipment or weapons the new army will have or need compared with the current force. Seeking to reassure Serbia and the international community, Kosovo's Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj said the new army "will never be used against them (Serbs)." He added: "Serbia's army will now have a partner — Kosovo's army — in the partnership for peace process." Serbia fears the move's main purpose is to chase the Serb minority out of Kosovo's Serbian-dominated north, a claim strongly denied by the government in Pristina. Kosovo President Hashim Thaci said that the new army will be "multiethnic, professional and will serve all citizens, peace in Kosovo, the region and wherever in the world, when asked." He called on a return to dialogue for normalizing ties with Serbia. The United States hailed Kosovo's parliament vote to form a new army as a first step and reaffirmed "its support for the gradual transition ... to a force with a territorial defense mandate, as is Kosovo's sovereign right." A U.S. embassy statement in Pristina urged Kosovo to continue "close coordination with NATO allies and partners and to engage in outreach to minority communities." "Regional stability requires that Kosovo make genuine efforts to normalize relations with its neighbor Serbia, and we encourage both sides to take immediate steps to lower tensions and create conditions for rapid progress on the dialogue," it said. In a sign of defiance, Serbs in northern Kosovo displayed Serbian flags on their streets and balconies. NATO-led peacekeepers deployed on a bridge in the ethnically divided northern town of Mitrovica to keep the peace. Kosovo's 1998-1999 war ended with a 78-day NATO air campaign in June 1999 that stopped a bloody Serbian crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatists. Semini reported from Tirana, Albania.

The Latest: Venezuelan firefighters dispute official version  [SEP]  The Latest on explosions at speech given by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro (all times local): Firefighters at the scene of an explosion that Venezuelan officials call an attack on President Nicolas Maduro are disputing the government's version of events. Three officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case say the incident was actually a gas tank explosion inside an apartment. Smoke could be seen coming out of a building window at the site of the incident. Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez said that several drones armed with explosives detonated near Maduro as he was delivering a speech. He characterized it as an attack aimed at the embattled president, who was recently elected to a new term in office despite a crippling economic and humanitarian crisis. Venezuela's government says several explosions heard at a military event were an attempted attack on President Nicolas Maduro. Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez said in a live broadcast Saturday that several drone-like devices with explosives detonated near the president. He said Maduro is safe and unharmed but that seven people were injured. Firefighters near the scene are disputing the government's version of events.
NASA’s TESS Space Telescope Has Spotted Its First Exoplanet  [SEP]  Image: Science and Engineering Research Council J survey/C. X. Huang et al., 2018 Say hello to Pi Mensae c—a small, Earth-like planet located nearly 60 light-years from our Solar System. It’s probably not able to sustain life, but it’ll go down in history as the first exoplanet detected by NASA’s new TESS satellite. NASA launched the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) on April 18, 2018, and it began operations on July 25. In an early test of its powers, the satellite nabbed its first light image on August 7, which we finally got to see this past Monday. Advertisement As its name suggests, TESS is a planet-hunting satellite. Using its four 10-centimeter optical telescopes, the satellite repeatedly scans wide fields of space, and monitors the brightness of candidate stars. This data is then analyzed by astronomers, who look for periodic dips in a star’s brightness—a possible sign of an orbiting, or transiting, exoplanet passing in front of the star. It would now appear that TESS has made its first finding of this kind. “Here, we report on the discovery of a transiting planet around Pi Mensae, exactly the type of planet TESS was designed to detect,” write the authors in their preprint paper, which was uploaded to the arXiv server yesterday. Advertisement Image: C. X. Huang et al., 2018 Pi Mensae, also known as HD 39091, is an unusually bright yellow subgiant (dwarf) star. This star is visible to the naked eye and is located nearly 60 light-years from Earth. Based on data gathered from July 25 to August 22, the TESS team has concluded that Pi Mensae c, as the newly discovered planet is called, is a super-Earth. It’s about 2.14 times Earth’s radius and 4.82 times Earth’s mass. Sadly, Pi Mensae c is way too close to its host star to support life. A single year on this planet lasts just 6.27 days. The planet may be uninhabitable, but its discovery is a positive sign that TESS is doing what it was built to do. Advertisement “TESS has begun to fulfill its promise to enlarge the collection of small, transiting planets orbiting bright stars,” write the authors in the study. “Such stars enable precise measurements of that planet’s mass and radius.” This is the second planet to have been detected around Pi Mensae. Back in 2001, astronomers spotted an absolutely huge planet in this system, Pi Mensae b, which is nearly 10 times the mass of Jupiter, and the largest planet known to astronomers. This planet is so big that its surface likely glows, leading some astronomers to think it’s more a brown dwarf, a kind of failed star, than a planet. It’s also in an eccentric, or highly elliptical, orbit, taking 5.7 years to revolve around its host star. Advertisement The preliminary survey of Pi Mensae c suggests it contains water, methane, hydrogen, and helium, in addition to a rocky, iron core. That’s pretty much all we know about this planet, but the authors of the new study say future observations made by the Gaia spacecraft and the yet-to-be-completed James Webb Space Telescope will likely reveal more about this relatively nearby exoplanet. These observations may be far off, but astronomers won’t have to wait long for another opportunity to study this star and its planets. TESS is scheduled to collect five additional months of data from this system, allowing the team to improve its knowledge of Pi Mensae c and to search for additional transiting planets. Advertisement This is the first of what should be a slew of TESS discoveries. The mission is supposed to last for two years, during which time 500,000 stars will be studied. If all goes according to expectations, the space telescope could uncover as many as 1,000 new exoplanets. So that’s one down, 999 to go. [arXiv]
U.S. calls for "strategic patience" after strikes near Kobani  [SEP]  The airstrikes destroyed an armored personnel carrier, armed vehicles and artillery belonging to the militant group, which had threatened to overrun the town on the Turkish border, the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a statement. Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said it was essential to take a long-term view of the conflict. The group may take Kobani or other towns, he said. While airstrikes were effective, military power alone would not be enough. "People need to understand we need a little strategic patience here. This group is not going to go away tomorrow, and Kobani may fall. We can't predict whether it will or it won't," Kirby said in an interview with CNN. "There will be other towns that they will threaten, and there will be other towns that they will take. It is going to take a little bit of time." The United States has launched airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq since August 8 and in Syria since Sept. 23, sometimes with partners in an international coalition that President Barack Obama has sought to build against the group. The airstrikes on Kobani were part of nine overall strikes in Syria conducted over the last two days with the United Arab Emirates, using bomber, fighter, and remotely piloted aircraft, CENTCOM said. It said all the aircraft left the area safely. The strikes near Kobani stalled the militant group, which had appeared set to seize the town after a three-week assault that sent tens of thousands of Kurdish residents fleeing over the Turkish border. U.S.-led airstrikes in the area redoubled after the Islamic State hoisted its black flag on the eastern edge of Kobani on Monday. Two other strikes near Raqqa, the group's de facto capital in Syria, hit a training camp for the militants and the group's fighters there, according to CENTCOM. Another strike near Deir al-Zor destroyed a tank, it said. The United States, Britain and the Netherlands also conducted five strikes on targets in Iraq on Tuesday and Wednesday using fighters and drones. Kirby said strikes in Syria were "a little more strategic in nature" than those in Iraq. "The campaign inside Syria is really designed to get at this group's ability to sustain, to recruit, to train, to equip, to finance itself," he said. In Iraq, the airstrikes have focused on specific fighting units, aimed at halting advances by the militants or aiding Kurdish or Iraqi government forces trying to retake territory on the ground. Kobani, on the Turkish border, "is not necessarily a strategically significant border town for ISIL because that border is porous already," Kirby said, referring to the group by one of its acronyms. Obama has ruled out the use of U.S. combat troops in the fight against Islamic State. The military strategy combines an air campaign with ground operations by local forces. Kurds, who live in many of the areas of northern Syria and Iraq that have been taken over by Islamic State fighters, as well as parts of southeast Turkey, have been pressuring the Turkish government to intervene to defend Kobani. The United States is also trying to get Turkey, its NATO partner, to engage more generally in the fight against Islamic State.
SKorea news agency: NKorea threatens to cancel US summit  [SEP]  SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - South Korea's Yonhap News Agency says North Korea is canceling a high-level meeting between the two countries and is threatening also to cancel a summit with the United States due to ongoing military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea. The two Koreas were set to hold a meeting Wednesday at a border village to discuss setting up military and Red Cross talks to reduce border tension and restart reunions between families separated by the Korean War. Yonhap says North Korea's Korean Central News Agency reported that Wednesday's meeting was canceled and that Pyongyang was questioning whether next month's summit between North Korea's Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump can also take place as planned. Yonhap says the two-week military exercise between the U.S. and South Korea started Friday.
While Trump backs up on climate change, Canada's oilsands see upside of reducing carbon  [SEP]  The gutting by Donald Trump of his predecessor’s climate-change initiatives is stirring debate about whether Canadian governments should decelerate their own green agendas, particularly if they make Canadian oil and gas less competitive. As promised, Trump signed an executive order Tuesday to suspend, rescind or flag for review more than a half-dozen measures in an effort to boost domestic fossil fuel production, which environmental groups are planning to challenge in court, and which they hope Canada won’t follow. Truth is, Canada’s oilsands sector, until recently the most vilified of fossil fuels, is too far down the road of de-carbonization to back up. Indeed, it’s pushing hard on innovations that reduce greenhouse gas emissions because in many cases they also make the deposits more resilient by reducing costs. As a recent study by CIBC World Markets put it, there is “considerable impetus” by the industry to improve its emissions intensity. “The goal for oilsands producers today is to lower supply costs and improve environmental stewardship while supporting oilsands development,” according to the study by Arthur Grayfer, Mark Zalucky and Trevor Bryan. The efforts reflect broader acceptance by the oil and gas community that it needs to up its game because society’s goals have changed, and if it doesn’t do it, it will be replaced by greener energy sources. As Darren Woods, the new CEO of Exxon Mobil Corp., said during IHS CERAWeek in Houston earlier this month: “We understand the risks associated with fossil fuels, and we think we can help mitigate those risks through technology.” In the oilsands industry, decarbonization can be achieved by a spectrum of applications, from doing things better with less steel and fewer energy inputs, to radical new recovery schemes, according to the CIBC report. “Our analysis suggests that in the next five years, greenfield oilsands development will be able to earn a 15 per cent rate of return in a US$50 a barrel oil world, and that Alberta’s emission cap may not hinder development in the next decade as conventional thinking believes, both of which point to the belief that oilsands (and not just higher quality oilsands) will not necessarily be a stranded resource.” Among the technologies under implementation, Imperial Oil Ltd. will likely be the first to use a combination of steam and solvent at its Aspen project, with a final investment decision anticipated this year, the report says. Suncor Energy Inc. is working on other innovations, including re-engineering SAGD from the ground up to do it more simply and cheaper, and testing driverless trucks in its mining operations, resulting in efficiency gains by improving safety, minimizing downtime, lowering maintenance work and reducing kilometers driven. Another study by the Canadian Energy Research Institute highlights six emerging technologies that can be deployed in the next five to seven years to significantly reduce costs and GHG emissions in the oilsands, enabling the sector to beat Alberta’s newly implemented emissions cap of 100 megatonnes a year. Without the technologies — which use various combinations of solvent, CO2, and steam injection — CERI estimates the cap would be reached by 2028. Instead, the institute estimates the technologies have the potential to reduce bitumen supply cost by 34 to 40 per cent, reduce fuel-derived emissions from insitu oilsands production by more than 80 per cent and delay the time until the emissions cap is reached by several decades. “Emissions and cost-reduction objectives are not adversely related,” the study finds. “For example, by choosing to implement the minimum cost objective configuration, dramatic emissions cuts are made as a result.” In conventional oil and gas, Canadian operators are implementing their own strategies to stay competitive, by pushing down costs and being innovative. While prepared to do the work, the Canadian sector’s greater concerns are around government initiatives that are more about appeasing fossil fuel opponents than results — such as increasing the regulatory burden for project reviews, and carbon taxes. Instead, Trump has promised to cut red tape, corporate taxes and could introduce a border adjustment tax that could increase the cost of Canadian oil and gas exported to the U.S. In a report to clients based on meetings with several major Canadian oil and gas companies last week, Citi analysts said industry executives seem confident the Canadian government will step in if Trump implements a border adjustment tax. And as far as the carbon tax, “there is hope the government could look to revenue-neutral options for the tax to mitigate potential impacts on industry activity and the Canadian economy.” It’s hard to say which climate-change approach — Trump’s contrarian, or Canada’s conformist — will prevail. The good news is that climate-change outrage is moving south.
Air Canada breach may impact 20,000 customers  [SEP]  MONTREAL — Some 20,000 Air Canada customers woke up Wednesday to learn their personal information may have been compromised after a breach in the airline's mobile app that prompted a lockdown on all 1.7 million accounts until their passwords could be changed. Air Canada said it detected unusual login activity between Aug. 22 and Aug. 24 and tried to block the hacking attempt, locking the app accounts as an additional measure, according to a notice on its website. Mobile app users also received an email alerting them as to whether their account had been affected. The app stores basic information including a user's name, email and phone number. Any credit card data is encrypted and would be protected from a breach, Air Canada said. But Aeroplan numbers, passport numbers, birth dates, nationalities and countries of residence could have been accessed if users saved them in their account profile, the company said. "Some data, such as names or emails, may have been visible if an unauthorized user was able to gain access to an account," spokeswoman Isabelle Arthur said in an email. The risk of a third party obtaining a passport in someone else's name is low if the user still has their passport and supporting documents, according to the federal government. Users can reactivate their account along stricter password guidelines by following instructions emailed to them or prompts when logging in. Some users reported problems with the process on social media, likely due to the volume of customers trying to unlock their account.
Austria: 5 monks assaulted at Vienna church  [SEP]  Police found the monks tied up, one of them with head injuries, nearly three hours later. They were aged between 56 and 68, and it appeared that the others had tried to intervene after one of the assailants — described as speaking with a foreign accent — attacked the oldest monk, the Austria Press Agency reported.
Rain sets off Indonesia landslide, killing 9 with 34 missing  [SEP]  JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Soldiers, police and residents fanned out across a damaged Indonesian village Tuesday, searching in the mud for possible victims of a landslide caused by torrential rain that killed at least nine people and left 34 others missing. Tons of mud that rolled from the surrounding hills late Monday buried 30 houses in Sirnaresmi village of West Java's Sukabumi district. Sixty people who were displaced have fled to a temporary shelter, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman. He said more than 500 rescuers have retrieved eight bodies from mounds of mud and pulled out four injured people, including an infant who died in the hospital. They are still searching for 34 villagers said to still be missing. Authorities struggled to get tractors and other heavy equipment over washed-out roads as heavy rain was hampering search efforts, Nugroho said. Television footage showed hundreds of police, soldiers and residents digging through debris with their hands, shovels and hoes. "Lack of equipment, bad weather and blackout hampered our rescue efforts for those who are still missing and feared dead," said Nugroho. Seasonal rains and high tides in recent days have caused dozens of landslides and widespread flooding across much of Indonesia, a chain of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile flood plains near rivers. The landslide occurred during New Year's Eve celebrations less than two weeks after a deadly volcano and tsunami disaster. On Dec. 22, the Anak Krakatau volcano in the Sunda Strait erupted and partially collapsed into the sea, causing a tsunami that killed 437 people on Java and Sumatra islands. At least 16 people still missing and more than 33,700 residents were displaced.
Norway's Carlsen beats US rival to keep chess crown  [SEP]  Carlsen in action against Curuana on Wednesday. Photo: Tolga Akmen / AFP Three-time chess champion Magnus Carlsen on Wednesday successfully defended his world title after demolishing US hopeful Fabiano Caruana in a winner-takes-all finale. The 27-year-old Norwegian won three successive rapid-chess tiebreakers in a display of intuition and guile that overwhelmed the 26-year-old American in London. The fearless performance will go a long way to cementing his claim to be history's greatest player -- a title some still award to Soviet-Russian legend Garry Kasparov. Kasparov himself appeared in awe of Carlsen's display in a format that has seen many grandmasters before him wilt under the mental strain. "Carlsen's consistent level of play in rapid chess is phenomenal," Kasparov tweeted. "We all play worse as we play faster and faster, but his ratio may be the smallest ever, perhaps only a 15 percent drop off. Huge advantage in this format." The games marked a complete departure from the string of draws played out in their original 12-match series which began on November 9. Yet those tense tugs of war were a testament to the prodigious skills of the American Italian. The first US contender since Bobby Fischer beat the Soviet Union's Boris Spassky at height of the Cold War in 1972 is the game's second-ranked player. Caruana has spent most of his career in Carlsen's shadow but is rated only three points below the Norwegian's leading 2,835 points. Chess experts said Carlsen appeared to be rattled by the Miami-born yoga lover in a memorable game 10. Carlsen was only too happy to agree to draws in the final two matches -- the last one from a winning position that saw Kasparov shake his head in disbelief. "In light of this shocking draw offer from Magnus in a superior position with more time, I reconsider my evaluation of him being the favourite in rapids," Kasparov tweeted after Monday's match. "Tiebreaks require tremendous nerves and he seems to be losing his." But Carlsen seemed determined to decide things in Wednesday's rapid-chess tiebreakers -- a format that saw him beat Sergey Karjakin in the 2016 title match in New York. Caruana admitted that he was "relieved" to still be in the contest after Monday's 12-match scare. "I'm mainly relieved. When you feel like you're sort of on the brink of defeat, or at least you have a very dangerous position, then of course it's quite good." But Carlsen never appeared to lose faith in skills that saw him dubbed the "Mozart of chess" by The Washington Post after becoming a grandmaster at the age of 13. "I think I have very good chances," Carlsen told reporters after Monday's game.

France's Emmanuel Macron tries to repair damage after army chief quit  [SEP]  ISTRES, France (AFP) - President Emmanuel Macron attempted Thursday (July 20) to mend fences with the military after the resignation of the armed forces chief in a row over budget cuts for which France's new leader has drawn criticism. General Pierre de Villiers quit on Wednesday (July 19) after being publicly slapped down by Macron for protesting the government's plans to slash 850 million euros (S$1,350 million) from this year's defence budget. His resignation capped a week-long spat, during which Macron made clear he would brook no insubordination as commander-in-chief, drawing a mix of criticism and respect. On Thursday, he reassured the troops that they had his support despite the spending cuts. Saying he "deeply respected" the military, which is engaged in operations against jihadists in Syria, Iraq and West Africa while also defending against attacks on home soil, Macron said: "I know what the nation owes you." He also repeated his promise to hike the defence budget by over a billion euros in 2018, in line with his promise to raise defence spending to 2 per cent of GDP - about 50 billion euros - by 2025. De Villiers, a highly respected figure who prided himself on speaking truth to power, riled Macron after telling a parliamentary committee last week he would not allow the armed forces to be "screwed". France's youngest-ever president, who has sought to project an image of authority since taking office in May, responded forcefully on the eve of the annual Bastille Day military parade. Rebuking 60-year-old de Villiers, without naming him, for the "undignified" public spat, he told a gathering of military top brass: "I am your boss". On Wednesday, he held that line, insisting it was "not the job of the head of the armed forces" to question the defence budget. In his resignation statement De Villiers said the spending cuts threatened the military's ability "to guarantee the protection of France and the French people." General Francois Lecointre, a 55-year-old veteran of the wars in the Balkans, has replaced him. The French opposition held Macron chiefly responsible for the row, which many commentators saw as the first misstep of the centrist's presidency. The conservative Le Figaro daily accused the president of "shooting himself in the foot" in behaving "like a little departmental head who is obliged to remind everyone who's boss". The leftist Liberation newspaper said Macron's "little authoritarian fit" could be a sign he was drunk on power and said he was time for him "to grow up a bit". Macron's defence cuts - part of a 4.5-billion-euro reduction in spending aimed at bringing France's budget deficit within EU limits - were viewed by the military as a betrayal after his strong show of support for the armed forces during his first weeks in office. Macron's first foreign trip was to Mali, where he meet French troops engaged in counter-terrorism operations. Earlier this month, he was photographed being winched action man-style onto a nuclear submarine from a helicopter. Retired general Dominique Trinquand, who advised Macron during his election campaign, said the row had clouded an otherwise "remarkable" debut with the military. "This is a hitch that will probably be a bit difficult to get past," he told AFP. Nuclear-armed France and Britain are the biggest military powers in the European Union. French forces are currently taking part in strikes against Islamic State jihadists in Syria and Iraq and 4,000 French soldiers are involved in counter-terrorism efforts in west and central Africa. At home, 7,000 soldiers are deployed to patrol the streets after a series of terror attacks that have killed more than 230 people since 2015.

WTC subway station reopens for first time since 9/11 attacks  [SEP]  NEW YORK (AP) - A New York City subway station has reopened for the first time since it was destroyed in the World Trade Center attack 17 years ago. Cheers erupted as the first train rolled into the new WTC Cortlandt station at noon Saturday. The old Cortlandt Street station on the subway system's No. 1 line was buried under the rubble of the twin towers on Sept. 11, 2001. Construction of the new station was delayed until the rebuilding of the surrounding towers was well under way.

Hong Kong leader says will not run for re-election  [SEP]  Prominent surveyor and former government advisor Leung Chun-ying attends a forum for chief executive candidates in Hong Kong March 12, 2012. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Leung Chun-ying said on Friday he will not stand for re-election in a 2017 vote for chief executive for family reasons, in a surprise announcement that throws open the race to govern the financial hub. Leung has been backed by the central government in Beijing which he said had accepted his decision not to contest the March election. "The central government has highly regarded my work," Leung told a news conference. "In a family, my children only have one father, my wife only has one husband." Leung did not elaborate but media has reported that a daughter has been hospitalized. Speculation on a new leader for Hong Kong is likely to focus on John Tsang, the city's financial secretary, or Regina Ip, a former city security chief. All candidates have to be approved by a 1,200-strong Election Committee, largely made up of pro-Beijing establishment figures, which will then vote from among them for a new leader. Hong Kong's next leader faces a host of challenges with concern growing over the influence of Beijing in city affairs as well as a fledging independence movement that has alarmed China's Communist Party leadership. Beijing's leaders have signaled they want Hong Kong's next chief to forge consensus across a politically and socially divided city, boost incomes and safeguard security in a place that remains significantly more free than the mainland. Tens of thousands of protesters clogged city streets for weeks in 2014 to demand a one-man-one-vote election for chief executive but they failed to win any concessions from Beijing. Tensions have risen in recent weeks amid a Beijing-backed legal crackdown against pro-independence and pro-democracy city lawmakers accused of mocking their oaths of office in gestures of protest against Beijing. Two have been disqualified after court cases and another four are facing legal challenges led by Leung and his justice secretary. The mainland's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said it "deeply regretted" Leung's personal decision for family reasons but respected it, the Xinhua news agency reported. Leung had resolutely implemented the one-country, two systems policy, the office said, referring to the formula for Hong Kong's autonomy under which the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Leung had "dependably handled a series of important political issues", it said. Tsang, who is less closely identified with Beijing's Communist Party leadership than Leung, has not ruled out standing but he has declined to say if Beijing has given him any sign about a possible bid. Tsang has experience in city government dating back to British rule. "Many people, no matter if they know me or not – or even those on the internet – are very supportive of me joining the election," Tsang in a radio interview last week. Ip, who is seen as close to the Beijing leadership and is also a former British-trained civil servant, is expected to announce her candidacy next week, according to media. Commenting on Leung's announcement, Ip said she was "touched and felt sympathetic" about his bid to strike a balance between official duties and family life. Leung's popularity has recently dipped to 38.5 points from 52.5 at the beginning of his term, according to a public opinion poll by the University of Hong Kong. But the departure of the unpopular leader would not solve the city's problems, a democracy activist said. "These problems come from the system itself. Until this moment, we still can't get universal suffrage," said Joshua Wong, 20, a leader of the 2014 protests.
Barack Obama takes respectful tone on passing of Fidel Castro  [SEP]  The United States greeted news of Fidel Castro’s death both with familiar disparagement of a “tyrant” whose revolution consigned Cuba to decades of totalitarian oppression as well as respectful expressions of hope that his passing will speed political reform on the island. President Barack Obama, whose visit to Havana in March was meant to highlight the steps he has taken to end the decades of diplomatic enmity between Cuba and the US, notably declined to replay any of the old grievances that for years have been traded across the Florida Straits. “History will record and judge the enormous impact of this singular figure on the people and world around him,” Mr Obama said. “We extend a hand of friendship to the Cuban people.” But some Republicans, especially those whose constituents include the large Cuban-American community in Florida, were less restrained in their appraisal of Mr Castro’s place in history and barely optimistic that his death in itself guarantees that change for the better will come soon. Donald Trump called the late Cuban leader a "brutal dictator" in a statement issued on Saturday morning. “The day that the people, both inside the island and out, have waited for has arrived: A tyrant is dead and a new beginning can dawn on the last remaining communist bastion of the Western Hemisphere,” Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican congresswoman and a Cuban-American said. “We lost our native homeland to communism. They just rule over Cuba with an iron fist.” Donald Trump, spending the weekend at his Florida estate, noted the passing of the former leader in a Twitter message that merely said, “Fidel Castro is dead”. Released hours later, his longer statement opened with an aggressive repudiation of the late leader. “Today, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades. Fidel Castro’s legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights.” However, it also offered glimpses of a softer tone that seemed to be a departure from his sometimes hostile campaign rhetoric regarding Cuba and the changes introduced by Mr Obama. “While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve,” the statement said. “Though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty.” In Cuba, it was Raul Castro, 85 who announced the death of his older brother late on Friday night. It was 60 years to the day since they and a few supporters left Mexico on a boat to launch their revolution . “At 10:29 at night, the chief commander of the Cuban revolution, Fidel Castro Ruz, died,” he said on state television, dressed in his familiar green military uniform. “Ever onward, to victory,” he added, without offering a cause of death. The elder Castro had been ailing for years. He ceded his position as leader of Cuba to his brother in 2008, two years after suffering a stomach affliction that almost killed him. While Mr Obama met Raul Castro during his Havana visit, he was snubbed by Fidel who later wrote a scathing commentary warning Cubans to beware his “honey-coated” words and reminding them of past US efforts to overthrow and weaken the communist government. The thaw in US-Cuba relations has seen both countries open embassies in each other’s capitals as well as a significant relaxation by the United States of restrictions on travel to and from the island. Just in the last few weeks, most of America’s scheduled air carriers, including United and American, resumed regular service to Cuba from cities across the US. “During my presidency, we have worked hard to put the past behind us, pursuing a future in which the relationship between our two countries is defined not by our differences but by the many things that we share as neighbors and friends – bonds of family, culture, commerce, and common humanity,” Mr Obama said on Saturday. However, because Congress remains resistant to rescinding a trade embargo first introduced in 1962, all the changes wrought by Mr Obama had to be done by executive order. As candidate for president, Mr Trump more than once threatened to scrub those changes, barring concrete progress on the part of Cuba on human rights and democratisation. “The next president can reverse them, and that I will do unless the Castro regime meets our demands,” he told supporters at a rally in Miami, highlighting the release of political prisoners and the full restoration of religious freedoms as conditions Cuba would have to meet. While the passing of Mr Castro will put the spotlight back on the US-Cuba ties in the short term, there is little indication that President-elect Trump has yet decided how he means to handle them. The course he eventually takes may depend in part also on his choice for Secretary of State, which he has yet to reveal. Among those rebuking Mr Castro even in death was Senator Marco Rubio, whose own quest for the Republican presidential nomination earlier this year fell victim to the Trump bulldozer. “The dictator has died, but the dictatorship has not,” Senator Rubio, himself of Cuban heritage, said in a statement, indicating his support for a more hawkish approach. “The future of Cuba ultimately remains in the hands of the Cuban people, and now more than ever Congress and the new administration must stand with them against their brutal rulers and support their struggle for freedom and basic human rights.” Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the US Senate, said Mr Castro’s death was an opportunity for the Cuban government to “turn the page for the good of the Cuban people,” adding that freedom and democracy were overdue in the country. “While Fidel Castro is gone, sadly the oppression that was the hallmark of his era is not,” he said.
SpaceX launches 1st recycled supply ship  [SEP]  CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — SpaceX launched its first recycled cargo ship to the International Space Station on Saturday, yet another milestone in its bid to drive down flight costs. After a two-day delay caused by thunderstorms, the unmanned Falcon rocket blasted off carrying a Dragon capsule that made a station delivery nearly three years ago. When this refurbished Dragon reaches the orbiting lab on Monday, it will be the first returning craft since NASA's now-retired shuttles. The first-stage booster flown Saturday afternoon was brand new, and as is now the custom, returned to Cape Canaveral following liftoff for a successful vertical touchdown. "The Falcon has landed," SpaceX Mission Control declared from company headquarters in Hawthorne, California, and a cheer went up. The plan is to launch the booster again, instead of junking it in the ocean as so many other rocket makers do. Just two months ago, SpaceX launched its first recycled booster on a satellite mission. Another flight featuring a reused booster is coming up later this month. This Dragon capsule, meanwhile, came back for take two following a few modifications and much testing. Shortly before liftoff, a SpaceX vice president, Hans Koenigsmann, called the Dragon reflight "a pretty big deal." It's all part of the company's quest, Koenigsmann said, to lower the cost of access to space through reusability. The Dragon soaring Saturday has the same hull and most of the same parts from its 2014 flight. SpaceX installed a new heat shield and parachutes, among a few other things, for the trip back to Earth at flight's end. The Dragon is the only supply ship capable of surviving re-entry; all the others burn up in the atmosphere. NASA's other supplier, Orbital ATK, will see its cargo carrier depart the 250-mile-high complex on Sunday, six weeks after arriving. Besides the usual supplies, the 6,000-pound shipment includes mice and flies for research, a new kind of roll-up solar panel and a neutron star detector. For now, SpaceX said savings are minimal because of all the inspections and tests performed on the already flown parts. NASA's space station program manager, Kirk Shireman, told reporters earlier in the week that SpaceX did a thorough job recertifying the Dragon and that the risk is not substantially more than if this were a capsule straight off the factory floor. He said the entire industry is interested in "this whole notion of reuse," first realized with the space shuttles. It was the 100th launch from NASA's hallowed Launch Complex 39A, the departure point for the Apollo moon shots as well as dozens of shuttle missions, including the last one in 2011. SpaceX now leases the pad from NASA; the company's first launch from there was in February. SpaceX has been hauling station supplies for NASA for five years, both up and down. This is the company's 11th mission under a NASA contract. The company's next step is to deliver astronauts using modified Dragons. That could occur as early as next year. Until SpaceX and Boeing start transporting crews, astronauts will continue to ride Russian rockets. On Friday, a Russian and Frenchman returned from the space station in their Soyuz capsule, leaving two Americans and a Russian behind. The station was zooming over Oman in the Persian Gulf when the Falcon took flight.
SC strikes down law on adultery: Timeline  [SEP]  New Delhi, Sep 27: Declaring that adultery is not a crime, the Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a colonial-era anti-adultery law, saying it was unconstitutional, dented the individuality of women and treated them as "chattel of husbands".

Stop comparing the Taliban to Daesh - it's nothing like Daesh --  [SEP]  The only thing that the two groups have in common is a Salafist ("Islamist") ideology, but apart from that, any other comparison is superficial and ignores the many differences between them.The renewed global attention on Afghanistan as the staging ground for this grand operation has also brought the Taliban back into focus, seeing as how it's the most effective anti-government fighting force and already controls or influences approximately half of the country's territory, if not more.The US has been fighting against the Taliban for 16 years now, yet it's been unable to defeat them, and it's doubtful that a paltry 4000 extra troops will make much of a tangible difference in the overall battlefield dynamics. In any case, the US is once again emphasizing the supposed anti-terrorist origins of the War on Afghanistan, bearing in mind that it and many other countries have classified the Taliban as a terrorist group. Be that as it may, however, the Taliban is nothing like Daesh (which is also banned in Russia), and the two regularly fight against one another in Afghanistan.Critics of this approach claim that both were "created by the US", but that's not true in the case of the Taliban. The US did in fact provide military, material, and managerial support to their Mujahedeen forerunners from mid-1979 onwards with the intent of provoking the Soviet intervention that would later take place by the end of that year, but this doesn't mean that it created the Taliban movement that emerged from that conflict. While it's responsible for crafting the structural conditions of chaos that gave rise to what eventually came afterwards, one shouldn't get confused and automatically believe that this simplistic "cause-effect" relationship means that the Taliban is, therefore, an agent of American hegemony.It's not, and the reality is that the Taliban is emblematic of perhaps the greatest example of blowback in American history, so let's take a closer look at what makes this group so different from Daesh:For starters, the Taliban is comprised of indigenous Afghan fighters, not the foreign jihadists who flocked to the battlefield to join Daesh.This makes the Taliban genuinely popular in Afghanistan, compared to the unpopularity of Daesh in "Syraq".The Taliban embody the millennia-old Afghan nationalist tradition of resisting foreign military forces from as far back as the time of Alexander of Macedon, whereas Daesh formed just a few years ago.There have been speculative but unverified reports that Pakistan supports the Taliban, but that's it, while Daesh enjoyed heavy international backing prior to becoming the "pariah" that it is today.Because it has no external backing, the Taliban have been forced to wage an insurgency, but Daesh's foreign support allowed it to develop into a semi-conventional army with tanks and Humvees.The Taliban only care about regaining control of Afghanistan, which is totally unlike Daesh's plans to establish an international "caliphate" across most of the Eastern Hemisphere in Afro-Eurasia.The above-mentioned factors advance the argument that the Taliban is actually a National Liberation Movement, which is a world apart from the forcible occupiers that Daesh is.The Taliban have never willingly or inadvertently been a pawn of the US' geopolitical goals, but Daesh just so happens to always conveniently be corralled in the direction of the US' grand strategic interests.And finally, the Taliban is on the upswing and is indisputably winning the war, which is the complete opposite of Daesh's rapid retreat and imminent defeat.
Number of people using Facebook reaches 2 billion  [SEP]  MENLO PARK, Calif. (AP) - Facebook is reaching another milestone, announcing that it now has more than 2 billion users. CEO Mark Zuckerberg says the new marker was reached early Tuesday and in a Facebook post said that he's proud of the role his company is playing in connecting people around the world. Facebook says more than 175 million people declare they "love" something on the site daily and an average of more than 800 million people hit Facebook's like button. Facebook users will likely see a personalized video celebrating the milestone in the next few days. The Menlo Park, California, company is putting more emphasis on creating virtual communities within the site while it also works to reduce violent, hateful and misleading content on the service.
New Zealand opposition selects first Maori leader  [SEP]  Wellington, Feb 27, 2018 (AFP) - - New Zealand's opposition National Party installed its first Maori leader Tuesday, selecting 41-year-old former lawyer Simon Bridges for the top job as it looks to reinvigorate its image after losing last year's "Jacinda-mania" election. Bridges campaigned on a platform of generational change after former prime minister Bill English, 56, announced earlier this month that he was leaving the conservative party. National had faced calls to revamp its leadership after losing last year's general election to the centre-left Labour Party, led by 37-year-old Jacinda Ardern. The son of a Baptist minister, Bridges has described his family as "deeply religious" and he unsuccessfully voted against allowing gay marriage in 2013. He spoke to Maori TV before the vote about the importance of his indigenous roots. "It's a part of what makes me and I hope Maori New Zealanders see that and are excited about that," he said. "It shows them that actually they can achieve and they can do interesting things with their lives and there's a lot of opportunity in this country." Bridges won a leadership ballot of National's 56 lawmakers by an undisclosed majority, with Paula Bennett retaining her position of deputy leader. He said he would hold Ardern and her government to account, accusing it of "muddling along". "(It) is big on lofty intentions, but struggling to turn that into real gains for New Zealanders," he said. "That's why we will continue to present an ambitious and strong alternative government, heading into 2020 (elections)." Bridges, a former prosecutor, was elected to parliament in 2008 and had stints as communications, economic development and transport minister when National was in office.
South Korea votes in historic election to pick its next president  [SEP]  South Koreans went to the polls on Tuesday choose a new president after Park Geun-Hye was ousted and indicted for corruption, against a backdrop of high tensions with the nuclear-armed North. Voters have been galvanised by anger over the sprawling bribery and abuse-of-power scandal that brought down Park, which catalysed frustrations over jobs and slowing growth. Left-leaning Moon Jae-In, a former human rights lawyer, has held a commanding lead in opinion polls for months. The final Gallup Korea survey of the campaign gave him 38 percent support, followed by former tech mogul Ahn Cheol-Soo on 20 per cent. “I feel the people’s strong will to change the government… we can make it a reality only when we vote,” Moon said after casting his ballot with his wife in western Seoul. Hong Joon-Pyo of Park’s Liberty Korea party, who according to the last poll languished in third place in the 13-strong field on 16 percent, urged voters to support him and branded Moon a “pro-Pyongyang leftist”. A record turnout was expected, and 63.7 per cent of voters had cast their ballots four hours before the polls closed compared with 59.3 per cent at the same point five years ago. Kim Sun-Chul, 59, said he voted for Moon because “this country needs to restore democracy which has been so undermined by the Park government”. National elections are public holidays in South Korea and nearly 14,000 voting stations opened at 6 am (2100 GMT yesterday). Exit poll results will be available immediately after voting closes at 8 pm (11:00 GMT). The campaign has focused largely on the economy, with North Korea less prominent, but after a decade of conservative rule a Moon victory could mean a sea change in Seoul’s approach towards both Pyongyang and key ally Washington. The 64-year-old — accused by his critics of being soft on the North — has advocated dialogue to ease tensions and to bring it to negotiations. He is seen as favouring more independence in relations with the US, Seoul’s security guarantor with 28,500 troops in the country. Their presence, he told reporters during the campaign, was “important not only to our own security but also to the global strategy of the US”. The North has carried out two nuclear tests and a series of missile launches since the start of last year in its quest to develop a missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the US mainland. Washington has said a military action is an option, sending fears of conflict spiralling. More recently US President Donald Trump has softened his message, saying he would be “honoured” to meet the North’s leader, Kim Jong-Un. Moon also says he would be willing to visit Pyongyang to meet Kim and advocates resumption of some of the inter-Korean projects shuttered by his predecessors, including the Kaesong joint industrial zone. In Seoul’s prosperous Seocho district, 72-year-old doctor Chung Tae-Wan backed Moon’s conservative opponent Hong, telling AFP he did so because “security is the most important thing”.

Death Toll Increases To 9 In China School Stabbing Attack  [SEP]  BEIJING (dpa-AFX) - The death toll in stabbing attack in the northwestern Shaanxi province in China has risen to nine, media reports said Saturday. The incident occurred at the Number 3 Middle School in Mizhi county on Friday, when the students were returning to home after their classes. The attacker, who was a former student at school, was seeking revenge for having been bullied at school. He was taken into custody by the police. Those dead included seven girls and two boys. Another 10 people have been hospitalized following the injuries met during the rampage. As China has strictly restricted the private gun ownership, knives are used as a weapon of choice.

Malaysia Ditches Terrible Fake News Law – freedombunker  [SEP]  Less than five months after passing legislation that made creating and disseminating fake news punishable by jail time, Malaysia's parliament has repealed the law. The Anti-Fake News Bill 2018 was approved in early April by the government of then-Prime Minister Najib Razak. But as the Associated Press reports, human rights advocates worried the law would be used to stamp out opposition ahead of Malaysia's general election in May. "This is a law that was clearly designed to silence criticism of the authorities and to quell public debate—it should never have been allowed to pass in the first place," Teddy Baguilat, a Philippine member of parliament, said in a statement. Baguilat serves on the board for the Southeast Asian nonprofit group ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights. Those found guilty under the now-repealed fake news measure faced up to six years behind bars, as well as a fine of up to 500,000 ringgit (about $123,000). But if the law's purpose was to keep Najib in power, then it failed. Najib's party was defeated in May, and Mahathir Mohamad became the new prime minister. On Thursday, the new government repealed the fake news bill by a voice vote. "We don't need new legislation. We already have existing laws, such as the Communications and Multimedia Act 1998 and others that can deal with" fake news, Deputy Minister Mohamed Hanipa Maidin told lawmakers prior to the vote. Baguilat praised the government's decision to get rid of the law. "The Malaysian lower house's decision today to repeal the wildly repressive Anti-Fake News Law marks a huge step forward for human rights in Malaysia," he said in his statement. "It not only shows that the Pakatan Harapan government is serious about its promises to strip controversial laws from the legal books, it also sends a signal to the wider region that positive human rights change is within reach." But while Malaysia may have gotten rid of this one law, it's still far from a bastion of free speech and press. The nation was ranked 145th out of 180 countries in the press freedom group Reporters Without Borders' 2018 World Press Freedom Index. The group noted that Malaysian newspapers must renew their operating licenses with the government every year. And under the decades-old Sedition Act, criticism of the government is heavily restricted. "The Malaysian authorities should now follow up and repeal all other repressive laws, including the Sedition Act," Baguilat said. Fake news is a real problem around the globe. But as Reason's Nick Gillespie has previously argued, that doesn't mean regulation is the answer.
Calgarians vote ‘no’ to bidding for 2026 Winter Games, in plebiscite  [SEP]  Out of 767,734 eligible voters, 304,774 voted and 171,750 said ”no.” Members of the “Yes” campaign react to the results of a plebiscite on whether the city of Calgary should proceed with a bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics, in Calgary, Alta., Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018. The results are in, and a majority of Calgarians are saying “no thanks” to a potential bid for the 2026 Winter Olympics. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jeff McIntosh A Calgary bid for the 2026 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games is destined to die after the majority of voters said ‘no’ to it. In a plebiscite asking citizens if they want to host a Winter Games again after the 1988 Winter Olympics in the city, 56.4 per cent of those who went to the polls cast a dissenting vote Tuesday. “I believed in what the Olympic Games could do for our community, for our province and for our country,” bid corporation chair Scott Hutcheson said. “I’m disappointed in the outcome, but I certainly respect the democratic process.” READ MORE: Olympic decision time for Calgaryians in 2026 plebiscite Out of 767,734 eligible voters, 304,774 voted and 171,750 said ”no.” “Today, I have to say, Calgarians won,” said Coun. Sean Chu, who was against a bid. The plebiscite’s result is non-binding on city council, which has the final say on whether Calgary proceeds with a bid. The results won’t be declared official until Friday. Council is expected to address the results Monday. A firm ‘no’ vote paves the way for a divided and nervous council to scuttle a bid. “I think it’s a very strong message,” said Daniel Gauld of the No Calgary Olympics organization. “I think city council is going to have to listen to that. “The provincial and federal funding will not be forthcoming with this decision today. I think it would be political suicide if they didn’t shut down this bid, so I expect we’ll be seeing that, hopefully.” Bid supporters and bid corporation Calgary 2026 people gathered at restaurant near the Saddledome to await the results Tuesday. Several athletes there were devastated when the result was announced. “I feel really heartbroken and disappointed,” said Helen Upperton, a silver medallist in bobsled. “I have a daughter who would be eight in 2026. I did this for her. My question to Calgary is now what? What is the big dream, what is the big idea?” A bid was nearly over before the plebiscite. Ten votes out of 15 on council were required Oct. 31 for a motion to pass on abandoning the plebiscite. Eight voted in favour of that motion which would have generated a cascade of other motions shutting down the bid. Calgary mayor Naheed Nenshi voted for continuing with a bid, saying the proposed host draft plan and budget was a good deal for the city. The Alberta government made its funding of a bid conditional on a plebiscite and provided $2 million to pay for it. “Today was a success because Calgarians were given the opportunity to have their say on whether to proceed with an Olympic bid,” Alberta Minister of Culture and Recreation Ricardo Miranda said in a statement. “This decision was never an easy one. Calgarians were provided the information they needed to make an informed choice and we respect their decision.” Calgary 2026 was led by Mary Moran, who came from Calgary Economic Development, and Hutcheson, a commercial real estate entrepreneur and former national-team skier. Calgary 2026 was hampered by the tardiness of what the cost-sharing agreement would be between the federal and provincial governments and the city. An agreement that was supposed to be ready for public consumption mid-August wasn’t clear until Oct. 30. “I have to work with city council every day and have for the last nine years and getting governments aligned is always a big challenge,” Moran said. “I wish we did it sooner, but we did the best we could with what we were dealt.” “We always knew we had a short runway, but everybody knows we came out with a pretty solid budget on Sept. 11 and we always said a couple of numbers would change and they did. It’s just unfortunate it was complicated.” In the estimated $5.1 billion price tag to host the games, the public investment ask was $2.875 billion and down from an initial $3 billion. The province committed $700 million, while the Canadian government said it would provide $1.45 billion. The city of Calgary was asked for $390 million, and was credited with the $150 million already committed to improving an area that would be a games hub. While no order of government offered to be a guarantor against debt, Calgary 2026 built $1.1 billion in contingency funds into its budget to mitigate financial risk. “I think building a dream and articulating that with our social-media type of environment today and a populist movement makes it more challenging,” Hutcheson said. “With the right dream and with the right city and with the right program, the Olympics should bring lasting memories to a community and we weren’t able to do it this time.” The International Olympic Committee invited Calgary, Stockholm and a joint Italian bid from Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo to be candidate cities for 2026. The IOC will accept bids in early January. The election of the host city is in Lausanne, Switzerland, in June. Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.
Missile which brought down MH17 flight 'came from Russia'  [SEP]  The missile that brought down Malaysian Airline flight MH17 was transported into East Ukraine from Russia, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors said they were not accusing Russia of involvement and there were 100 people "linked to the crash or the transport of the Buk" missile, but they are yet to determine who could be held criminally responsible. Families of the 298 passengers and crew killed on the Boeing 777-300 flight have been told that the Buk missile used to shoot down the plane came into East Ukraine from Russia. Hans de Borst, whose 17-year-old daughter perished, said he and other family members were briefed privately before the news conference to announce the preliminary results of the investigation today. According to Mr de Borst, Dutch investigators said they had proof that a mobile Buk missile launcher had been moved into eastern Ukraine from Russia and was later returned. Chief Dutch police investigator Wilbert Paulissen said:"Based on the criminal investigation, we have concluded that flight MH17 was downed by a Buk missile of the series 9M83 that came from the territory of the Russian Federation." The conclusions came after a two-year Dutch-led criminal probe of the disaster. A separate investigation by Dutch safety officials last year concluded that the Amsterdam-to-Kuala Lumpur flight was downed by a Buk missile fired from territory held by pro-Russian rebels. Russia has consistently denied allegations that pro-Moscow rebels in eastern Ukraine were responsible for the disaster in July 2014. On Monday, the Russian military said it has new radio-location data that show the missile that downed the aircraft did not originate from rebel-controlled territory, and said it would turn the data over to investigators. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reiterated that assertion today ahead of the Dutch report. Referring to Russian radar data, he said: "If there was a rocket it could only have been launched from a different area. “You can't argue with it, it can't be discussed." As part of a joint investigation, Dutch police and judicial officials have been working with counterparts from Australia, Belgium, Malaysia and Ukraine, seeking to gather the best possible evidence for use in prosecution of the perpetrators. Forensic samples were taken from passengers' and crew members' bodies and luggage, and satellite data and communications intercepts were scrutinised. The team also appealed for information from witnesses who may have seen the missile launch. About two-thirds of the passengers aboard MH17 were Dutch nationals and the crew members were Malaysians. Malaysia proposed setting up an international tribunal to try those responsible for the plane's destruction, but Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution in favour of a tribunal.
Syria says suspected US missiles fired at air base; Washington denies strike  [SEP]  Syrian state TV said there were casualties in what it said was a suspected US missile attack on a major air base in central Syria but the United States denied it had launched any air strikes against the country. The state broadcaster earlier said explosions were heard at the T-4 airfield near Homs, which is close to the ancient city of Palmyra in central Syria. A Syrian military source was quoted as saying air defences shot down eight missiles fired at the base, also known as the Tiyas Airbase, where defence analysts say there are large deployments of Russian forces, and where jets fly regular sorties to strike rebel-held areas. The state broadcaster said there were several dead and wounded in the strike. The base is in a strategic desert area, where Syria's main gas fields are located. It had been under the control of Islamic State militants until the Syrian army and its allies regained control last year after heavy Russian military intervention. "An aggression was perpetrated on T-4 air base in several strikes that is most likely to be an American attack," state television said in a news flash. The US Pentagon said it was not conducting air strikes in Syria "at this time," formally denying the Syrian state television report. When asked about the explosions, an Israeli spokeswoman declined to comment. Israel has struck Syrian army locations many times in the course of the conflict, hitting convoys and bases of Iranian-backed militias that fight alongside Syrian President Bashar al Assad's forces. An intelligence source based in the region told Reuters he did not rule out an Israeli strike on the base. Israel had previously said Syria had allowed Iran to set up a complex at the base to supply its ally, the Lebanese militant Shi'ite group Hezbollah, with weapons. The Israeli military last February accused Iranian-backed militias of operating at the base, from where it said an Iranian drone, that was shot down over northern Israel, had been launched. Israel has long said Iran was expanding its influence in a belt of territory that stretches from the Iraqi border to the Lebanese border, where Israel says Iran supplies Hezbollah with arms. Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed militias have a large military presence in Syria and are well entrenched in central and eastern areas near the Iraqi border. US President Donald Trump said earlier on Sunday there would be a “big price to pay” after medical aid groups reported dozens of civilians, including many children and women, were killed by poison gas in a besieged rebel-held town. The United States launched a cruise missile strike on a Syrian air base a year ago in response to the killing of dozens of civilians in a sarin gas attack in an opposition-held town in northwest Syria. The gas attack was blamed on Assad. The US missile strike was against a Syrian air base which Washington said was used to launch the strike. The Syrian state denied government forces had launched any chemical attack. Russia, President Bashar al-Assad’s most powerful ally, called the reports fake.
Trump is incredibly jealous of one person  [SEP]  Rachel Sklar is a New York-based writer and co-founder of Change the Ratio, which aims to increase visibility and opportunity for women in tech and new media, and TheLi.st, a network and media platform for women. She was a volunteer for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The views expressed are her own. He's rich. He's powerful. He was just elected President of the United States of America. Sure, he's no longer as young as he once was when he boasted about grabbing women by the -- what was that word? -- or stiffing undocumented Polish workers or publishing full-length newspaper ads calling for the return of the death penalty in New York, stirring fear by invoking a crime of which 5 black teenagers were later exonerated by DNA evidence. He doesn't have the cheekbones of Milo Ventimiglia or the sex appeal of Idris Elba or the fingers of Michael Fassbender. But he was just elected President, and, much as it pains me still to type these words, leader of the free world. And yet I can't help thinking that Trump is incredibly jealous of one person right now: Hillary Clinton. That's the kind of loser Trump would name a "winner" -- if it had been him. And oh, how he seems to wish it had been. What else can you call someone with 306 Electoral College votes to date who still tweets baseless claims about "millions of people who voted illegally" costing him the popular vote? Sore winner much? Sure, Trump loved winning the presidency. Who wouldn't? But he really doesn't seem to like doing any of the stuff that goes along with it -- living in the White House (not enough gold), receiving intelligence briefings (not enough Ivanka), divesting his business assets (Now? When he can finally get rid of those wind farms ? No way.) It seems clear that Trump never really contemplated what it would actually mean to take the office of president. (Political journalists reported that closest allies weren't sure he wanted it, and during the campaign there was even speculation that he'd quit if he won, which Trump himself did not deny .) But winning the popular vote? By a landslide? Under that scenario, Trump would have the freedom to brandish a win without changing anything about his life -- and even better, he would have a reason to play the victim, emerging as the hero railing against a rigged system (the one role he'd actually prepared to take on). Instead of pretending to enjoy spending quality time with Reince Priebus, he could call in to morning shows and subtweet Hillary Clinton, enjoying all the media coverage without being accused of destabilizing world markets or tearing at the very fabric of democracy. Here's how we can tell he'd rather be doing that -- because he is doing it anyway. Trump is so unnerved by Clinton's popular vote win that, like Kristen Wiig's one-upping character Penelope on "Saturday Night Live," he's claiming that his popular vote win would have been even more popular. He's so annoyed by the drive for recounts in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan that he's proclaiming his vote rigged, too (even though he, you know, won). He doesn't need no stinkin' computer scientists and their statistical models and sub-1% margins , and he definitely doesn't need no stinkin' Russian hackers . He's a victim too. And also the "Hamilton" cast members are a bunch of mean old bullies! But as Trump is learning, it's different doing all of this as President-elect. Even though it may distract momentarily from his multi-emolument nest-feathering , he is still under scrutiny for things he thinks are perfectly reasonable , such as passing the running of his business on to his adult children and then having them visibly meet with world leaders or alleging unsubstantiated massive-scale voter fraud. And now he has to manage Kellyanne Conway and Rudy Giuliani who are sending him not-at-all-coded messages through the media, since they know that's where he's most likely to look. Of course, there's no real argument to be made yet that Trump has changed any aspect of his life, or plans to, really. He told The New York Times that conflicts of interest won't apply to him as President -- a reading of the Constitution so generous as to be completely wrong, but that does not seem to trouble him. And of course, as President-elect he is working within a framework for the next few weeks, which dovetails with the things he likes -- creating reality drama with his Cabinet picks (aka finalists!), planning for a big party in his honor (inauguration), announcing a theatrical first day in office and then imagining the fun headlines of his first 100 days in office when he'll get to do the fun stuff such as nominate a Supreme Court justice. But that is the easy stuff, that you can plan for. Decisions are tough -- if you care enough to think about them, and weigh them, and truly consider them. If, however, they are inconveniences to your cable news diet and grip-and-grins with Indian business associates, then you're going to delegate, punt or wing it. The other stuff won't be so easy, or so fun. It's the stuff that necessitates security briefings , competent and experienced Cabinet picks and a solid bench of experienced public servants who are the key to the day-to-day functioning of the government. It's the stuff of being president and commander in chief. It's the stuff that Hillary Clinton has been doodling in the margins of her briefing books probably since 2008, if not the '90s. But this is the Trump administration , and these are decisions -- so many decisions! -- and they all fall to him. Donald Trump -- entitled inheritor of so much for so long -- is now inheriting the burden of performance, and urgency and expectation. Very soon, he's going to have to start doing things -- or else the American people will turn his biggest weapon against him in four years and say: You're fired. And in the meantime, Clinton gets to watch, assess, cock an eyebrow and all too probably find him wanting. And at some point, she'll let him know it. She has a Twitter account, too. And a mandate. She did, after all, win the popular vote.
Britain warns will not pay Brexit cash if no EU deal | Malay Mail  [SEP]  LONDON, Sept 13 — Brexit minister Dominic Raab issued a fresh warning today that Britain would not pay the financial settlement promised to the EU after Brexit if there is no divorce deal. London has agreed to settle its bill from four decades of membership, estimated at up to £39 billion (€44 billion, US$51 billion, RM211 billion), as part of a withdrawal deal. But talks on the wider agreement have stalled, prompting concerns that Britain could crash out of the European Union in March 2019 with any deal at all. Raab was speaking ahead of a meeting of Prime Minister Theresa May’s cabinet on the British government’s planning for a no-deal scenario. One consequence would be that “we wouldn’t pay out the money that has been agreed”,” he told BBC radio. “It’s not a threat, it’s statement of fact as part of our no-deal planning. “We would be mindful of our strict legal obligations, but the amount and the phased way it is set out in the withdrawal agreement would fall away because there would be no deal.” The final payment would be “substantially lower” than the estimate agreed so far, he said. The Brexit negotiations are entering their final stretch, with both sides now aiming for an agreement in October or early November. All EU states are also stepping up their planning for a no deal scenario. The British government will later today publish 28 “technical notices” covering issues as varied as mobile phone roaming charges and upholding environmental standards. They follow a similar batch published last month, which are intended to inform businesses and citizens on steps they would need to take in the event of a no deal. “These technical notices are part and parcel of our sensible, pragmatic approach to preparing for all outcomes,” Raab said in a statement. “Getting a deal with the European Union is still by far and away the most likely outcome.” — AFP
Mayor of Utah city killed in 'insider attack' in Afghanistan  [SEP]  Mayor of Utah city killed in 'insider attack' in Afghanistan NORTH OGDEN, Utah (AP) — The mayor of a Utah city was killed during an attack in Afghanistan while he was serving with the state's National Guard, the Salt Lake Tribune and other media reported. North Ogden Mayor Brent Taylor died Saturday in an apparent "insider attack" in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, the Tribune reported. Another U.S. service member is being treated for wounds sustained in the attack, American military officials said. The Utah National Guard has identified the service member killed as a member of the Guard. The Guard member's name is being withheld pending notification of next of kin. But Utah Lt. Gov. Spencer J. Cox wrote on his Facebook page that Taylor, 39, has been killed. "Devastating news. North Ogden Mayor Brent Taylor was killed today while serving in Afghanistan," Cox said. "I hate this. I'm struggling for words. I love Mayor Taylor, his amazing wife Jennie and his seven sweet kids. Utah weeps for them today. This war has once again cost us the best blood of a generation. We must rally around his family." U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch issued a statement Saturday about Taylor's death on Twitter. "Brent was a hero, a patriot, a wonderful father, and a dear friend. News of his death in Afghanistan is devastating. My prayers and love are with Jennie and his 7 young children. His service will always be remembered," Hatch said. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert plans to hold a news conference on Sunday to discuss the death. Taylor was deployed to Afghanistan in January with the Utah National Guard for what was expected to be a 12-month tour of duty. Taylor, an officer in the National Guard, previously served two tours in Iraq and one tour in Afghanistan. At the time of his deployment in January, Taylor told local media that, as an intelligence officer, he will be assigned to serve on an advisory team training the staff of an Afghan commando battalion. "Right now there is a need for my experience and skills to serve in our nation's long-lasting war in Afghanistan," he said. "President Trump has ordered an increase in troops, and part of the new strategy focuses on expanding the capabilities of the Afghan commando units." Taylor became mayor of North Ogden, a city of about 17,000 people 46 miles north of Salt Lake City, in 2013. The Tribune reported that on the day of his deployment in mid-January, North Ogden police escorted Taylor and his family around town as hundreds of residents lined the streets to see him off.
Powerful typhoon bearing down on Okinawa  [SEP]  Powerful Typhoon Chaba approached Okinawa Prefecture on Monday, causing airlines to cancel more than 200 flights, including those at Naha Airport. The Meteorological Agency issued a warning for storm conditions and high waves as Typhoon No. 18 was moving north-northwest near Okinawa Island, packing winds of up to 306 kph as of 6:50 p.m. The typhoon, with an atmospheric pressure of 905 hectopascals at its center, was expected to near northern Kyushu from Tuesday night through Wednesday, according to the Meteorological Agency. As of 6:50 p.m. Monday, the typhoon was located 100 km south of Kume Island, west of Okinawa Island, the agency said. The canceled flights included those operated by All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines. The local governments of Naha, Urasoe and Kumejima advised residents to evacuate, and the prefectural government shut offices other than those involved in disaster-related duties. Some public and private offices stopped work and schools called off classes.
Trump says summit removed North Korean nuclear threat, but...  [SEP]  SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that North Korea no longer posed a nuclear threat and his top diplomat offered a hopeful timeline for “major disarmament,” despite scepticism at home that Pyongyang will abandon its nuclear weapons following this week’s summit. Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued a joint statement after their historic meeting in Singapore on Tuesday that reaffirmed the North’s commitment to “work towards complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula” and gave U.S. guarantees of security to North Korea. Democratic critics in the United States said the agreement was short on detail and the Republican president had made too many concessions to Kim, whose country is under U.N. sanctions for its nuclear and weapons programs and is widely condemned for human rights abuses. Just over half of Americans approve of how Trump has handled North Korea, but only a quarter think the summit will lead to the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Wednesday. North Korea’s state media hailed the summit as a success, including highlighting Trump’s surprise announcement after the meeting that the United States would stop military exercises with South Korea, which the North has long sought. Despite the lack of detail in the summit agreement, Trump stressed at a news conference afterward that he trusted Kim to follow through. He returned to Washington early on Wednesday and hailed the meeting, the first between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader, as a major win for American security. “Everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office,” Trump tweeted. “There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea. Meeting with Kim Jong Un was an interesting and very positive experience. North Korea has great potential for the future!” Kim also returned home, the North’s official news agency said. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is charged by Trump with leading follow-on negotiations, said the United States hoped to achieve “major disarmament” by North Korea within the next 2-1/2 years. Democratic lawmakers pointed out that North Korea had often made similar statements in the past about “denuclearisation,” all the while developing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles that could be capable of striking the United States. “One trip and it’s ‘mission accomplished,’ Mr. President? North Korea still has all its nuclear missiles, and we only got a vague promise of future denuclearisation from a regime that can’t be trusted,” said Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee. “North Korea is a real and present threat. So is a dangerously naive president,” he wrote on Twitter. Senator Chris Van Hollen, also a Democrat, said of Trump’s tweet about North Korea no longer presenting a threat: “This is truly delusional.” Trump also downplayed concerns about Kim’s human rights record. In an interview with Fox News broadcast on Wednesday, Trump said: “A lot of other people (have) done some really bad things. I could go through a lot of nations where a lot of bad things were done.” The summit statement provided no details on when Pyongyang would give up a nuclear weapons programme or how the dismantling might be verified. Sceptics of how much the meeting achieved pointed to the North Korean leadership’s long-held view that nuclear weapons are a bulwark against what it fears are U.S. plans to overthrow it and unite the Korean Peninsula. Speaking to reporters on a trip to Seoul, where he went to brief South Korean officials, Pompeo was asked if he would like to accomplish major nuclear disarmament within Trump’s current term, which ends in January 2021. He replied: “Oh yes, most definitively. “Absolutely ... you used the term major, major disarmament, something like that? We’re hopeful that we can achieve that in the 2-1/2 years.” The United States has long insisted on complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation by North Korea, but in the summit statement, North Korea committed only to the “complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula,” phrasing it has used in the past. North Korea has often rejected unilateral nuclear disarmament, instead referring to the denuclearisation of the peninsula. That has always been interpreted in part as a call for the United States to remove its “nuclear umbrella” protecting South Korea and Japan. Pompeo bristled at a question about why the words “verifiable” and “irreversible” were not in the summit joint statement, in the context of denuclearisation. “It’s in the statement. You’re just wrong about that. ... Because complete encompasses verifiable and irreversible. I suppose you could argue semantics, but let me assure you that it’s in the document,” Pompeo said. Pressed on how the agreement would be verified, he said: “Of course it will. ... I find that question insulting and ridiculous and frankly ludicrous.” Despite Trump’s assertion about the North Korean nuclear threat being over, a senior U.S. official responsible for studying the North Korean military said the U.S. intelligence assessment of the nuclear and other military threat posed by North Korea to U.S. and allied forces and bases in Asia and the northwest Pacific remained unchanged. But the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which assesses threats to U.S. national security, declined to comment on the president’s assertion. It also declined to reaffirm a February 2018 assessment in which it said: “North Korea will be among the most volatile and confrontational WMD (weapons of mass destruction) threats to the United States over the next year.” In a post-summit announcement that appeared unexpected even to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, Trump said on Tuesday the United States would stop military exercises with South Korea while North Korea negotiated on denuclearisation. “We save a fortune by not doing war games, as long as we are negotiating in good faith - which both sides are!” he later wrote on Twitter. U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham called the cost reasoning “ridiculous,” telling CNN: “It’s not a burden onto the American taxpayer to have a forward deployed force in South Korea.” “It brings stability. It’s a warning to China that you can’t just take over the whole region. So I reject that analysis that it costs too much, but I do accept the proposition, let’s stand down (on military exercises) and see if we can find a better way here.” The United States maintains about 28,500 soldiers in South Korea, which remains in a technical state of war with the North after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty. There was some confusion over precisely what military exercises Trump had promised to halt. The U.S.-South Korean exercise calendar hits a high point every year with the Foal Eagle and Max Thunder drills, which both wrapped up last month. Another major exercise is due in August.
Afghan Taliban delegation visits Uzbekistan to talk security, power...  [SEP]  KABUL (Reuters) - A delegation from the Afghan Taliban met officials in Uzbekistan during a five-day trip to the country last week to discuss issues including transport and power lines and peace in Afghanistan, the movement’s political office said. Muhammad Sohail Shaheen, spokesman for the Taliban’s political office, said on Saturday Taliban representatives met Uzbek Foreign Minister Abdul Aziz Kamilov and Special Representative for Afghanistan Ismatulla Irgashev during the Aug. 6-10 visit. He said they “discussed current and future national projects such as security for railroad and power lines.” “Views were also exchanged with officials of Uzbekistan about the withdrawal of foreign forces and how to achieve peace in Afghanistan,” he said. The statement, issued as Taliban fighters were battling government forces for control of the central city of Ghazni, adds to a mixed series of signals since an unexpected three-day truce during the Eid al-Fitr holiday in June. Taliban representatives have met U.S. officials to talk about the framework for possible peace talks and the Western-backed government is considering offering a second ceasefire during the Eid al-Adha holiday later this month. But at the same time, fierce fighting has continued in different parts of Afghanistan, inflicting heavy casualties on soldiers and police and threatening the security of parliamentary elections scheduled in October. The attack on Ghazni, which controls a vital highway between the capital Kabul and southern Afghanistan, has given the insurgents their highest profile success since they came close to taking the western city of Farah in May. The rail and power links from Uzbekistan are vital both for cross-border trade and for maintaining Afghanistan’s shaky power supplies, which are already subject to frequent blackouts. The Taliban, fighting to topple the Western-backed government and drive out international forces, have generally refrained from sabotaging vital infrastructure and have sought to reassure neighbouring countries about their aims. A senior Taliban official said the movement had established a political office in the Uzbek capital Tashkent aimed at developing better ties and showing that they did not intend to support local insurgent groups.
Feathered baby dinosaur tail found trapped in amber  [SEP]  While browsing amber markets in Myanmar, scientists discovered the feathers and partial tail of a tiny baby dinosaur that lived some 99 million years ago. The find, described in the journal Current Biology, offers a rare window onto the structure and organization of dinosaur feathers — one that could help shed new light on their evolution. Scientists have long studied feathers that pop up in the fossil record in part because they want to understand the origins of birds. Birds are thought to be the only living descendants of dinosaurs — and questions of how and when their ancestors first developed flight (and the feathers that enabled it) remain confounding mysteries. In recent years, paleontologists have also realized that many dinosaurs were not scaly (a la Jurassic Park) but feathered like birds. However, their plumage’s original purpose (for example, for insulation or for camouflage) remains up for debate. Researchers want to understand the origin of feathers, as well as figure out how they eventually evolved for flight. But there are limits to what they can learn from studying feathers in isolation, without seeing how they were positioned and organized on the body — and without knowing which species the feathers came from. And those preserved plumes found with fossil skeletons are typically compressed flat in the rock, which makes it difficult to know what the animal looked like in three dimensions. This new fossil, encased in amber, solves all of those issues. Co-lead author Lida Xing of the China University of Geosciences discovered the fossil at an amber market in Myanmar last year. Because of its bushy appearance, the seller believed the tail to be some kind of trapped plant — but Xing believed differently and asked the Dexu Institute of Paleontology to purchase it. “It wasn’t until Lida took a close look at it that he realized there were feathers coming off the side of the little filaments running through the amber,” said co-lead author Ryan McKellar, a paleontologist with the Royal Saskatchewan Museum in Regina, Canada. “That’s when the real fun began, from a research standpoint.” Amber is a paleontologist’s best friend for many reasons: Among them, it insulates the fossil from chemical alteration by the environment and helps to preserve it in three dimensions. “Amber is like nature’s plastic,” McKellar said. “It seals in a lot of information at the same time it’s basically drying out a lot of inclusions that end up in the resin.” Xing, McKellar and colleagues CT-scanned the tail through the amber, studying its microscopic structure. The partial tail, which probably belonged to a coelurosaur about the size of a sparrow, consists of eight full vertebra surrounded by highly preserved feathers. In birds, tailbones are fused together in what’s known as a pygostyle, which is why scientists think this one must have come from a non-avialan dinosaur. “This flexible tail isn’t something that you see in modern birds, so it restricts you to a group of dinosaurs that are outside of archaeopteryx and modern birds,” McKellar said. “You have to be dealing with something lower down in the evolutionary tree. And this means you’re firmly in dinosaur territory, as opposed to bird territory.” Unlike birds, the dinosaur’s feathers had an underdeveloped main stem, or rachis. The top feathers were dark and those on the underside were light, so it may have been used for camouflage or signaling, McKellar said. There are limits to what this particular fossil can reveal about feathered dinosaurs, the scientist added – but it does show that more such fossils might well exist, mistaken for bushy plants or other debris, just waiting to be found. His colleagues, he added, were continuing to search amber markets, hoping to get lucky once again.

UK's Labour says it will vote down a Brexit deal that fails to meet...  [SEP]  LIVERPOOL, England, Sept 24 (Reuters) - The Brexit spokesman for Britain’s opposition Labour Party said on Monday his party would vote against any deal Prime Minister Theresa May strikes with the European Union if the agreement failed to meet its tests. Labour has set six tests for supporting any Brexit deal and May might require support from opposition lawmakers to secure parliamentary backing for any agreement as some in her own Conservative Party have said they oppose her current proposals.

Above-normal hurricane season predicted  [SEP]  MIAMI (AP) – U.S. government forecasters expect warm ocean waters will fuel an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecast calls for 11 to 17 named storms, with five to nine hurricanes. Two to four hurricanes could be “major” with sustained winds of at least 111 mph. Acting NOAA Administrator Ben Friedman says atmospheric conditions suppressing hurricane development could be weak or non-existent this year over the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The six-month Atlantic storm season officially starts June 1. A rare April tropical storm formed this year over the open ocean. National Weather Service Deputy Director Mary Erickson says high-resolution hurricane model upgrades should provide “much improved” forecast guidance this year. Friedman says a new weather satellite will help forecasters see developing storms in greater detail.
US newspapers to Trump: We're not enemies of the people  [SEP]  New York (AP) — Newspapers from Maine to Hawaii pushed back against President Donald Trump’s attacks on “fake news” Thursday with a coordinated series of editorials speaking up for a free and vigorous press. The Boston Globe, which set the campaign in motion by urging the unified voice, had estimated that some 350 newspapers would participate. They did across the breadth of the country. The Portland (Maine) Press-Herald said a free and independent press is the best defense against tyranny, while the Honolulu Star-Advertiser emphasized democracy’s need for a free press. “The true enemies of the people — and democracy — are those who try to suffocate truth by vilifying and demonizing the messenger,” wrote the Des Moines Register in Iowa. In St. Louis, the Post-Dispatch called journalists “the truest of patriots.” The Chicago Sun-Times said it believed most Americans know that Trump is talking nonsense. The Fayetteville Observer said it hoped Trump would stop, “but we’re not holding our breath.” “Rather, we hope all the president’s supporters will recognize what he’s doing — manipulating reality to get what he wants,” the North Carolina newspaper said. On Thursday morning, Trump again took to Twitter to denounce “fake news.” He wrote: “The Boston Globe, which was sold to the the Failing New York Times for 1.3 BILLION DOLLARS (plus 800 million dollars in losses & investment), or 2.1 BILLION DOLLARS, was then sold by the Times for 1 DOLLAR. Now the Globe is in COLLUSION with other papers on free press. PROVE IT!” That followed this tweet from the president: “THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA IS THE OPPOSITION PARTY. It is very bad for our Great Country….BUT WE ARE WINNING!” The Morning News of Savannah, Georgia, said it was a confidant, not an enemy, to the people. “Like any true friend, we don’t always tell you want you want to hear,” the Morning News said. “Our news team presents the happenings and issues in this community through the lens of objectivity. And like any true friend, we refuse to mislead you. Our reporters and editors strive for fairness.” Some newspapers used history lessons to state their case. The Elizabethtown Advocate in Pennsylvania, for instance, compared free press in the United States to such rights promised but not delivered in the former Soviet Union. “If you haven’t already, please subscribe to your local papers,” said the Times, whose opinion section also summarized other editorials across the country. “Praise them when you think they’ve done a good job and criticize them when you think they could do better. We’re all in this together.” That last sentiment made some journalists skittish. Some newspapers, including the Wall Street Journal and the San Francisco Chronicle, wrote editorials explaining why they weren’t joining the Globe’s effort. The Chronicle wrote that one of its most important values is independence, and going along with the crowd went against that. Both the Chronicle and Baltimore Sun said that it plays into the hands of Trump and his supporters who think the media is out to get him. Nolan Finley, columnist and editorial page editor of The Detroit News, spoke up for the press but added a scolding. He said too many journalists are slipping opinion into their news reports, adding commentary and calling it context. “Donald Trump is not responsible for the eroding trust in the media,” Finley wrote. “He lacks the credibility to pull that off. The damage to our standing is self-inflicted.” The Radio Television Digital News Association, which represents more than 1,200 broadcasters and web sites, is also asking its members to point out that journalists are friends and neighbors doing important work holding government accountable. “I want to make sure that it is positive,” said Dan Shelley, the group’s executive director. “We’re shooting ourselves in the foot if we make this about attacking the president or attacking his supporters.” It remains unclear how much sway the effort will have. Newspaper editorial boards overwhelmingly opposed Trump’s election in 2016. Polls show Republicans have grown more negative toward the news media in recent years: Pew Research Center said 85 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said in June 2017 that the news media has a negative effect on the country, up from 68 percent in 2010.

Science teacher 'tackled US school shooting suspect'  [SEP]  A male student armed with two handguns opened fire at a suburban Indianapolis middle school on Friday, wounding another student and a teacher before being taken into custody, authorities said. Seventh-grader Ethan Stonebraker said his science teacher had confronted the youth, who he said pulled out a gun and opened fire while the class was taking a test. "Our science teacher immediately ran at him, swatted a gun out of his hand and tackled him to the ground," Ethan said. "If it weren't for him, more of us would have been injured for sure." The attack at Noblesville West Middle School happened at around 9am, police chief Kevin Jowitt said at a news conference. He said the suspect asked to be excused from class before returning with the guns, and investigators believe he acted alone. "We do know the situation resolved extremely quickly," Mr Jowitt said. There was no information released on the identities or conditions of the victims, who were taken to hospitals in Indianapolis. Indiana University Health spokeswoman Danielle Sirilla said the teacher was taken to IU Health Methodist Hospital and the wounded student was taken to Riley Hospital for Children. She did not know the seriousness of their injuries. The attack comes a week after an attack at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas, that killed eight students and two teachers, and months after the school attack that killed 17 people in Parkland, Florida. The Florida attack inspired students from that school and others throughout the country to call for more restrictions on access to guns. After the Indiana attack, students were bused to the Noblesville High School gym, where hundreds of parents and other family members arrived to retrieve them. Eighth-grader Chris Navarro said he was inside an auditorium when he heard several gunshots about a minute before the bell rang for the change in classes. "The speaker came on and said we were on lockdown and people rushed in and we went to the back of the room. I went into this little room in the back with three other people," he said. Jennifer Morris, who was among the worried parents who rushed to collect their children, said she was at work when her 14-year-old son sent a text message about the shooting. "He said, 'I'm OK, please come get me.' That was probably 20 minutes after it happened," she said. "It's like a bad dream. I don't know how you get the kids through this. This isn't something you're trained for as a parent." Governor Eric Holcomb, who was returning from a trip to Europe on Friday, issued a statement saying he and other state leaders were getting updates about the situation and that 100 state police officers had been made available to work with local law enforcement. "Our thoughts are with all those affected by this horrible situation," Mr Holcomb said.
Explosions rip through Baghdad mosque, killing 10  [SEP]  BAGHDAD (AP) — A pair of explosions ripped through a mosque in a mostly Shiite district of Iraq's capital Wednesday, killing at least 10 worshippers, including two children, security officials said. They said the blasts in Baghdad's Sadr City district also wounded 25 people, almost completely destroyed the mosque and damaged several nearby houses. The officials agreed to give details of the attack only on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. A government statement said the blasts occurred at a weapons depot in Sadr City. It said an investigation was underway to determine the cause of the explosions, but did not give the exact location of the depot. The officials said weapons were stored inside the mosque, which is frequented by supporters of Muqtada al-Sadr, a Shiite cleric whose supporters once fought American troops in Iraq in the years after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Al-Sadr's followers won the largest number of seats in Iraq's May 12 parliamentary elections but would have to form a coalition government with other blocs in a process that could drag on for months. Al-Sadr also commands a government-backed paramilitary force, which took part in the nearly three-year war against the Islamic State group, which had in 2013 and 2014 seized large swathes of Iraq's territory. Iraq declared victory over IS last year, but the extremist group retains pockets in western and northern Iraq and continues to stage attacks on security forces. Associated Press writer Murtada Faraj in Baghdad contributed to this report.
Florida Governor Rick Scott 'on his way' to shooting scene  [SEP]  Five people killed in shooting at Fort Lauderdale airport Five people have been killed after a shooting at Fort Lauderdale airport in Florida, officials in the state have said. One suspect has been taken into custody. US Senator Bill Nelson told reporters he was carrying a military ID. Eight people were injured and transported to a hospital in the area.
Gas search, economy, peace talks on Cyprus president's plate  [SEP]  NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) — Nicos Anastasiades is on the home stretch of his long political career. On Sunday, the 71-year-old Greek Cypriot secured his second five-year term as president of the part of Cyprus that is internationally recognized. He has said this will be his final term in office. His priorities — revving up the economy, overseeing an offshore gas search that could transform the east Mediterranean region's politics and restart reunification talks with breakaway Turkish Cypriots. Here are some of the key issues in his in-tray: An ongoing search for oil and gas off the island's southern coast will figure prominently on the president's to-do list. Italian energy company ENI is currently drilling an exploratory well whose prospects have been described as "very encouraging" by Energy Minister Yiorgos Lakkotrypis. U.S. company Noble has already discovered a deposit off the island estimated to contain over 4 trillion cubic feet of gas. While, the hydrocarbon search could mean energy independence for the tiny, resources-poor island nation, it also has the potential to transform the political calculus in this tumultuous region. Gas is undergirding alliances Cyprus has forged with Egypt and Israel which have found sizeable gas reserves inside their waters. Cyprus and its two neighbors are looking at how to get the gas to market, including Europe. But the search isn't without its problems. Turkey strongly objects to the gas search, insisting that it's flouting the rights of breakaway Turkish Cypriots to the island's mineral wealth. Ankara also claims part of the area which the Cypriot government has opened for exploration licensing. The Cyprus government says it's exercising its sovereign rights and any gas finds will be equitably shared with all Cypriots. The Cypriot economy has rebounded well after a 2013 financial crisis that nearly left the country bankrupt. The crisis had forced Anastasiades — fresh from his first presidential election victory — to accept a multibillion-euro rescue deal from creditors that involve the seizure of deposits over 100,000 euros ($124,000) in the country's two largest banks. After massive cuts to wasteful spending, the economy is growing at a stellar rate of 4 percent. But it still has its problems including high unemployment and a banking system weighed down by a huge number of bad loans. Anastasiades offered a huge clue as to how he plans to tackle joblessness on the night of his re-election, telling supporters that he'll bolster private enterprise and entrepreneurship to create more jobs. He's set to look across the political spectrum for help. A quick resumption of peace talks with breakaway Turkish Cypriots is still in question after last July's negotiations collapse. Cyprus was split along ethnic lines in 1974 when Turkey invaded following a coup by supporters of union with Greece. Sapped momentum has to be injected back into the peace process. Last week's revelation that the Turkish Cypriots have withdrawn a key document from the process is another setback. The document was a map Turkish Cypriots had submitted that outlined how much territory they'd be willing to cede to Greek Cypriots as part of an envisioned two-zone federation. Greek Cypriots had submitted a map of their own. Anastasiades had hailed the submission of maps as a first in the decades-long history of the talks, indicative of just how much process had been achieved. Government spokesman Nicos Christodoulides said the president's first move will be to soon call party leaders to decide the next steps. U.N. Chief Antonio Guterres has said he's ready to mediate fresh talks again, but that it's up to both leaders to get the ball rolling. Anastasiades had said he'd sound out Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci who has said that if talks are to resume, the way they're conducted has to change. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Gordie Howe bridge to cost $5.7 billion; set to open by end of 2024  [SEP]  Ottawa, ON — A new bridge that will span Canada’s busiest border crossing with the United States is expected to cost $5.7 billion. The Crown corporation overseeing the construction of the Gordie Howe International Bridge says the price tag includes the costs of designing, building, operating and maintaining the bridge and its ports of entry on both sides of the border for 30 years. The bridge authority says the cost would have been more than $6.2 billion if the Canadian government had decided not to partner with a private-sector consortium and to foot the entire bill itself. Construction of the six-lane, 2.5-kilometre cable-stayed bridge will provide a second span connecting Windsor, Ont., and Detroit — but it won’t be open to traffic until the end of 2024. The Canadian government expects to pay for the bridge by collecting tolls. It agreed years ago to take on the cost of the project in order to bypass Congress, which had refused to sign off on American funding. About one-quarter of all goods traded annually between Canada and the U.S. passes through the Detroit-Windsor corridor.
EU's Security Must No Longer Depend on US, Says Macron  [SEP]  French President Emmanuel Macron said Monday that he would put forward new proposals for the European Union to boost its security, saying the bloc must stop depending on American might. "Europe can no longer rely on the United States for its security. It is up to us to guarantee European security," he said in a speech to relaunch his diplomatic agenda. His proposals will be unveiled "in the coming months", Macron told an audience of some 250 diplomats, lawmakers and international relations experts gathered to mark the return from the summer break. "I want us to launch an exhaustive review of our security with all Europe's partners, which includes Russia," he added. Macron's comments came after a string of gestures from US President Donald Trump distancing himself from traditional NATO allies. Macron came to power last year vowing to overhaul the EU and has pushed for deep political reforms -- including a separate budget for the eurozone -- which have so far met with lukewarm support. The French president, who will head to Denmark and Finland for a three-day trip from Tuesday hoping to shore up support for his EU shake-up, called for redoubled efforts to reform the bloc. "We need to take new initiatives, build new alliances," he said. "France wants a Europe which protects, even as extremism has grown stronger and nationalism has awoken," he said.
Chinese scientists break key barrier by cloning monkeys  [SEP]  LONDON (Reuters) - Chinese scientists have cloned monkeys using the same technique that produced Dolly the sheep two decades ago, breaking a technical barrier that could open the door to copying humans. Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua, two identical long-tailed macaques, were born eight and six weeks ago, making them the first primates -- the order of mammals that includes monkeys, apes and humans -- to be cloned from a non-embryonic cell. It was achieved through a process called somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), which involves transferring the nucleus of a cell, which includes its DNA, into an egg which has had its nucleus removed. Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Neuroscience in Shanghai said their work should be a boon to medical research by making it possible to study diseases in populations of genetically uniform monkeys. But it also brings the feasibility of cloning to the doorstep of our own species. “Humans are primates. So (for) the cloning of primate species, including humans, the technical barrier is now broken,” Muming Poo, who helped supervise the programme at the institute, told reporters in a conference call. “The reason ... we broke this barrier is to produce animal models that are useful for medicine, for human health. There is no intention to apply this method to humans.” Genetically identical animals are useful in research because confounding factors caused by genetic variability in non-cloned animals can complicate experiments. They could be used to test new drugs for a range of diseases before clinical use. The two newborns are now being bottle fed and are growing normally. The researchers said they expect more macaque clones to be born over the coming months. Since Dolly - cloning’s poster child - was born in Scotland in 1996, scientists have successfully used SCNT to clone more than 20 other species, including cows, pigs, dogs, rabbits, rats and mice. Similar work in primates, however, had always failed, leading some experts to wonder if primates were resistant. The new research, published on Wednesday in the journal Cell, shows that is not the case. The Chinese team succeeded, after many attempts, by using modulators to switch on or off certain genes that were inhibiting embryo development. Even so, their success rate was extremely low and the technique worked only when nuclei were transferred from foetal cells, rather than adult ones, as was the case with Dolly. In all, it took 127 eggs to produce two live macaque births. “It remains a very inefficient and hazardous procedure,” said Robin Lovell-Badge, a cloning expert at the Francis Crick Institute in London, who was not involved in the Chinese work. “The work in this paper is not a stepping-stone to establishing methods for obtaining live born human clones. This clearly remains a very foolish thing to attempt.” The research underscores China’s increasingly important role at the cutting-edge of biosciences, where its scientists have at times pushed ethical boundaries. Three years ago, for example, researchers at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou caused a furore when they reported carrying out the first experiment to edit the DNA of human embryos, although similar work has now been done in the United States. Scientists at the Shanghai institute said they followed international guidelines for animal research set by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, but called for a debate on what should or should not be acceptable practice in primate cloning.
Utah nurse claims police assault after she refused patient blood...  [SEP]  Sept 1 (Reuters) - A nurse at a Utah hospital was assaulted by a police officer last month after declining to allow him to obtain a sample of an unconscious patient's blood because he had neither a warrant nor the patient's consent, local media reported. Prosecutors in Utah will consider criminal charges against the officer, an official said on Friday. Video of the July 26 incident from Salt Lake City police officers' body-worn cameras showed Alex Wubbels, dressed in blue medical scrubs, consulting with colleagues before showing the waiting officers a printout of the University of Utah Hospital's policy on providing blood samples to test for alcohol or drugs. The patient was a truck driver who was comatose when he was brought to the hospital burns unit after a crash with a vehicle being driven by someone fleeing police, the Deseret News reported. Wubbels explained to the officers that under the policy, which she said was agreed to by the police department, she would need a warrant, the patient's consent or the patient would need to be under arrest. "I'm just trying to do what I'm supposed to do, that's all," Wubbels told the officers, noting that they did not meet any of those criteria. One officer, identified in media reports as Detective Jeff Payne, appeared angered and grabbed at Wubbels before gripping her around her torso. "We're done," Payne said. "You're under arrest." He then dragged Wubbels outside as she screamed. "Somebody help me!" Wubbels cried as Payne pushed her against a wall and handcuffed her. "You're assaulting me! Stop! I've done nothing wrong." Karra Porter, Wubbels' lawyer, said at a news conference on Thursday where the video was shown that the nurse followed the law and the police were wrong, according to the Deseret News. Wubbels said her first duty was to her patients. Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill agreed with police that a criminal investigation of the officer is warranted, chief deputy district attorney Jeff Hall said in a telephone interview. He declined to say what charges may be filed. Salt Lake City Police Chief Mike Brown said in a statement on Friday that he was "alarmed" by the video and that the department had apologized. Payne was suspended from blood-collecting duties while an internal investigation was being conducted, Brown said. In a separate statement, Mayor Jackie Biskupski called the incident "completely unacceptable" and extended an apology to Wubbels for her ordeal. The University of Utah said in a statement on Thursday that it supported Wubbels "and her decision to focus first and foremost on the care and well-being of her patient." The hospital said it had created a new policy with police that would preclude officers from arriving in person to seek blood samples.

HURRICANE MATTHEW | Haiti death toll increases to 108  [SEP]  MIAMI (AP) — The death toll in Haiti from Hurricane Matthew has risen to at least 108. Interior Minister Francois Anick Joseph announced the figure today in the capital of Port-au-Prince as authorities and aid workers work to gauge the extent of the deaths and damage in the impoverished country. Details on the deaths were not immediate available. Previously, officials said there had been at least 23 deaths from the storm in Haiti. There were also four people killed in the neighboring Dominican Republic, one in Colombia and one in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Hurricane Matthew roared across the tip of the peninsula on Tuesday but authorities have struggled to reach people in the most remote areas including around the town of Jeremie and throughout the Grande Anse area.
Iran deal 'naked as emperor with no clothes', says Israel  [SEP]  Tuesday's agreement between six world powers and Iran has left Israeli officials scrambling for leverage and crying foul, convinced the historic deal will do little to curb Tehran's nuclear ambitions and will leave Israel under greater threat. "Israel is like the little child that is pointing its finger and saying, 'the king is naked, this agreement is naked,'" Yuval Steinitz, who is responsible for nuclear affairs in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet, told reporters. Despite months of trying to stall or derail the agreement - including Netanyahu denouncing it before a joint session of the U.S. Congress in March - Israel has failed to exert influence on the United States, its closest ally, and is feeling exasperated. Netanyahu spoke to Barack Obama on Tuesday evening and issued a lengthy statement afterwards that sought to explain that his poor relationship with the U.S. president had had no bearing on the outcome of the negotiations in Vienna. "The claim heard from political elements to the effect that the personal relationship between myself and President Obama affected the nuclear agreement is absurd," he said. "Even before I took office as prime minister, there was an intention on the part of the American administration to normalize relations with Iran." The first Israeli opinion poll published since the deal was announced found a solid majority supported Netanyahu's view. The survey broadcast by Channel 10 television found 69 percent objected to the agreement with Iran and only 10 percent backed it, with the rest undecided. Thirty-two percent of Israelis thought their country should respond by attacking Iranian nuclear installations, while 40 percent opposed that idea and 28 percent had no view, polling results broadcast on Wednesday showed. Steinitz described the deal, painstakingly negotiated over the past several years, including 17 straight days before Tuesday's signing, as full of loopholes, particularly when it comes to verification and Iran's "breakout" capability - the time it would theoretically take it to develop a nuclear weapon. Israel is also agitated by the fact that Iran will have access to around $100 billion of frozen assets as soon as the deal is implemented, which is expected to take six months. "Those who think that giving Iran $150 billion will have no effect on the Middle East are naive," said Steinitz. "It's like pouring fuel on the burning Middle East." As well as the long-term nuclear threat, Israel's alarm stems from Iran's backing for militant groups in the region, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and parts of Syria, Hamas in Gaza and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. "(We are) this little, tiny Jewish democracy that survives in the most difficult and problematic neighbourhood on the face of the earth," said Steinitz. While small, Israel has a strong army, is believed to have the region's only nuclear arsenal, and receives around $3 billion a year in military-related support from the United States, an amount expected to increase following the Iran deal. Asked what extra weapons Israel might request from the United States, Steinitz would not be drawn, saying the only acceptable compensation would be an agreement that prevents Tehran producing nuclear arms. In the interim, he said, Israel reserved the right to defend itself, and would do so unilaterally if required. "Israel's right of self-defence is non-negotiable and cannot be limited by any international agreement, good or bad. "When a country like Iran is calling once again, even in the last few days, for Israel's destruction, Israel of course has the right, and also the duty, to defend itself by itself." With the United States and other major powers determined to work with Iran, Israel finds itself allied with Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the Gulf states in expressing wariness over the deal. Domestically, though, it has served as a unifying force in Israeli politics. The centre-left opposition is fully behind Netanyahu's criticism of the deal and there is the possibility of a new national-unity government being formed as a result.
The incredibly simple reason why Trump is going to release the Nunes memo  [SEP]  (CNN) The great debate consuming Washington right now is this: Will President Donald Trump release the memo or not? The answer, I think, is simple: Yes, of course he will. Because that's who he is. And what he does. The memo in question comes from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, a California Republican, and allegedly details a series of missteps, mistakes and misinformation at the highest levels of the FBI. FBI Director Christopher Wray, who Trump appointed after firing then-director James Comey last May, and deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein have voiced "grave concerns" about releasing the memo, which, they have suggested, omits important facts and provides an incomplete and inaccurate picture of how the bureau conducted itself during the 2016 election. So passionate is Wray about not releasing the memo that White House officials are worried he may well quit if Trump gives Congress the OK to do so And yet, as Trump boarded Marine One to return to Washington from a speech at the Republican congressional retreat in West Virginia on Thursday afternoon, a senior administration official made clear that the President is expected to give Congress the go-ahead as soon as Friday morning. "The president is OK with it," a senior administration official said. "I doubt there will be any redactions. It's in Congress' hands after that." If you are surprised by that decision, you have been residing on another planet for the better part of the last three years. If you have been paying attention since Trump announced his presidential bid in June 2015, you know that the President is actually a very simple person to understand. He views everything that comes across the transom through one lens: "How does this impact me?" Sure, we all tend to think of how every situation impacts us. Self-interest is a very powerful motivator, after all. But most people who get elected president tend to open their aperture when considering how to react to the million things that cross their desk every day. Among those broader concerns: 1) Is this true? 2) Is this in the best interest of the country? 3) Will this set any sort of dangerous precedent for future White Houses? Trump, as he has shown any number of times as president (and as a candidate) is entirely unburdened by those sorts of concerns. To him, all decisions about what to do with a certain piece of information or how to react to a certain situation center around this basic question: Does this make me look good/smart? Trump doesn't think in terms of good/bad or true/false. He thinks in terms of advantage/disadvantage or, to put it in more Trumpian terms, winning/losing. Which brings me back to the Nunes memo and the debate over whether to release it. Trump wanted the memo released before he even read it because it affirmed something he already believed: That top officials at the FBI didn't want him to win and worked to finesse the investigation into Hillary Clinton's private emails so that it didn't end in an indictment for her. "Crooked Hillary Clinton's top aid, Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailors pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey & others" And so, when the Nunes memo emerged, it was like a dream come true for Trump. The memo proves his point! He was right all along! Comey and the rest of them were out to get him! That his own FBI director has urged against the release of the memo because it presents an incomplete and inaccurate picture of the bureau and could do real damage to the intelligence-gathering abilities of the agency is not terribly concerning to Trump. It proves him right. What else does he need to even think about? See? Like I said: Simple.
Pakistani police say the death toll from market bombing in country's northwest has jumped further, is now at 35  [SEP]  Pakistani police say the death toll from market bombing in country's northwest has jumped further, is now at 35 PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistani police say the death toll from market bombing in country's northwest has jumped further, is now at 35.
Police say 6 detained in foiled plot to attack Berlin race  [SEP]  BERLIN — Six people were detained in connection with what police and prosecutors allege was a plan to carry out an extremist attack on Berlin’s half-marathon Sunday, German authorities said. “There were isolated indications that those arrested, aged between 18 and 21 years, were participating in the preparation of a crime in connection with this event,” prosecutors and police wrote in a joint statement. Berlin police tweeted that six people were detained in co-operation with the city’s prosecutor’s office. The German daily Die Welt first reported that police foiled a plot to attack race spectators and participants with knives. The main suspect allegedly knew Anis Amri, a Tunisian who killed 12 people and injured dozens more when he drove a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin in December 2016, Die Welt reported. One of the apartments Berlin police raided before the race started Sunday was also searched after the Christmas market attack, the newspaper said. Special police forces detained four men in connection with the race plot, the paper said — different from the six that police reported. Die Welt reported that the main suspect, who was not identified, had prepared two knives to use in the attack. It also wrote that in one of the searched apartments, dogs trained to find explosives barked when they were taken into the dwelling’s basement. The local daily Tagesspiegel reported that the main suspect had been under observation for two weeks around the clock. After a foreign intelligence service tipped off German authorities that he was planning to attack the half-marathon, police raided apartments and two vehicles in the Charlottenburg and Neukoelln districts of the city. The half-marathon was being guarded by some 630 police officers, German news agency dpa reported.
7.5 quake hits in Pacific Ocean near New Caledonia  [SEP]  A powerful magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck in the southern Pacific Ocean near New Caledonia on Wednesday, prompting authorities to warn of a tsunami threat to nearby islands.The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said tsunami waves of between 1 and 3 meters (3 and 10 feet) were possible along some coasts of New Caledonia and Vanuatu, while waves of up to 1 meter (3 feet) were possible in Fiji.New Caledonia is in the Pacific to the east of Australia.The warning center said there was no threat to Hawaii.According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the quake struck about 168 kilometers (104 miles) east of Tadine in New Caledonia at a shallow depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles). Earthquakes are generally more destructive when the epicenter is near the surface.At least five aftershocks also hit, ranging in magnitude from 5.6 to 6.0.New Caledonia sits on the Pacific "Ring of Fire," the arc of seismic faults around the Pacific Ocean where most of the world's earthquakes and volcanic activity occur.
Poland to sign deal to buy US Patriot air defence systems  [SEP]  WARSAW, Poland — Poland says it will sign a deal Wednesday to purchase U.S. air defence Patriot systems as it seeks to bolster its defences against a resurgent Russia. The Defence Ministry said Tuesday the deal for the anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems will be signed by the defence minister in Warsaw. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said the first Patriot systems will come to Poland in 2022 and the following ones in 2024. Morawiecki said they were of the latest generation and would ensure the security of Poland’s skies in an “unprecedented way.” He wouldn’t reveal the cost, but said it was “negotiated very well.” Last week, Poland signed an accompanying offset deal worth about 950 million zlotys ($279 million) with the Patriot systems makers Raytheon and Lockheed Martin.
2 die in Russian navy helicopter crash  [SEP]  The Russian military says a navy helicopter has crashed during a night training flight, killing both pilots. The navy said the crash occurred while the Ka-29 of the Baltic Fleet was performing a training mission late Thursday. The Investigative Committee said Friday the helicopter had been making a run to land on a navy ship. It said rescuers have found the helicopter’s debris and the probe is ongoing. The Ka-29 is a Soviet-designed twin-engine helicopter intended for use from navy ships.
AP FACT CHECK: Shaky assumptions in Trump immigration pitch | Metro News  [SEP]  WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's endorsement of legislation to restrict and reshape legal immigration is based on some shaky assumptions, such as the idea that low-wage green-card holders are flooding in to take jobs from Americans. Trump swung behind a bill from Republican Sens. David Purdue of Georgia and Tom Cotton of Arkansas, calling it "the most significant reform to our immigration system in half a century" if made law. Many economists dispute a major study, cited by the White House, that claims low-skilled immigrants hurt wages. Harvard economist George Borjas said the arrival of thousands of Cuban refugees in Miami in 1980 led to lower wages for existing low-skilled workers, but red flags have been raised about his methods. Much of the recent research suggests that immigration has no significant effect on job growth for U.S.-born workers in the long-run. Most economists also say the benefits of immigration outweigh the costs — a point made in a letter to congressional leaders in April that was signed by 1,470 economists, six of them Nobel laureates. Researchers have also found that in many states, the benefits of consumer spending by immigrants and taxes paid outweigh any government costs. In North Carolina, for every dollar spent on health care and education, the economy got $11 back from Hispanic residents in consumer spending and taxes paid — a finding that includes immigrants in the country illegally, said James Johnson, a demographer at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. TRUMP: "The RAISE Act prevents new migrants and new immigrants from collecting welfare, and protects U.S. workers from being displaced. And that's a very big thing. They're not going to come in and just immediately go and collect welfare. " About 58 of immigrant families with children have used "any welfare," compared with 42 of U.S.-born families with children, according to the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. That includes even subsidized or free lunches offered generally in low-income schools, not specifically to people who have applied for assistance. As for the food-stamp program known as SNAP, 27 of children of immigrants have received such benefits, versus 25 of those with U.S.-born parents, according to a Migration Policy Institute analysis of the 2015 American Community Survey. The National Academies saw little difference between immigrant and non-immigrant families with children when it comes to cash welfare assistance. About 6 of families in both groups received such payments. Immigrants are increasingly better educated than people born in the United States. This makes them more likely to earn decent incomes and less likely over time to rely on public assistance. The Pew Research Center said in 2015 that 41 of immigrants who had arrived in the past five years held a college degree, much higher than the 30 of non-immigrants in the United States. And 18 held an advanced degree, also much higher than the U.S. average.
Paris Las Vegas resort crippled by accidental power-line cut  [SEP]  LAS VEGAS — A contractor knocked out power Thursday to a Las Vegas Strip resort, displacing thousands of guests and gamblers, trapping almost a dozen people in elevators for a time, and prompting a room-to-room search of the 33-storey tower looking for stragglers. The entire Paris Las Vegas, including the casino, restaurants and shops, lost power about 9:45 a.m. when workers in the basement cut into the main power line, Clark County spokeswoman Stacey Welling said. The incident was called an accident during work that was authorized and scheduled, and there was no indication of sabotage or foul play, Welling said. No injuries were reported. The full evacuation was ordered after noon, when the fire alarm system battery power ran low and backup generator didn’t kick in. Clark County Fire Chief Greg Cassell said about 3,000 guests and employees were evacuated. As night fell, the iconic faux Eiffel Tower lit up, but authorities decided it was too late to promise to let guests back in to the darkened 2,900-room hotel, Caesars Entertainment Corp. spokesman Rich Broome said. Only people who needed prescription medication were being escorted by hotel and security officials to their rooms. “It’s pitch black in there,” Broome said. “The building will stay evacuated until all power is restored and fire officials declare it safe.” “It’s frustrating for us,” Broome added. “Much more frustrating for our guests.” Broome said workers were drilling into concrete in a basement boiler room to reach the power main. Displaced guests and new arrivals were directed to the Caesars-owned Bally’s Las Vegas Hotel next-door, where company officials were helping them find rooms at Caesars and competitors’ properties up and down the Strip. Guests who missed or had to change airline flights, or had to leave luggage in their rooms, were being promised assistance, Broome said. Eleven people were rescued from five different elevators, and a few people suffered from anxiety-related issues, but no one was hospitalized, the fire chief said. Firefighters went door-to-door inside the darkened building to make sure everyone was out, Cassell said. Entrances to the hotel were draped in yellow crime scene tape while hotel security guards stood by to ensure no one tried to re-enter. Jay Sarno of Santa Fe Springs, Calif., told the Las Vegas Review-Journal he won more than $1,000 on a Keno machine just before the power went out. Sarno said the casino gave him a voucher to claim his money after power is restored. He said members of his travelling group walked up 18 flights of stairs in the dark to retrieve belongings before fire officials ushered them outside. The outage drew comparisons to an Easter Sunday 2004 blackout that lasted three days at the 3,000-room Bellagio resort. Business losses were estimated in the millions of dollars. No injuries or thefts were reported in that incident, and officials with hotel owner MGM Grand, now MGM Resorts International, said authorities found no evidence of sabotage or a criminal act. Nevada Power Co. officials called it an internal problem at the property.
Building With Homeless People Burns, Collapses In São Paulo, Casualties Feared [Video]  [SEP]  A building in Largo do Paysandú, the Republic region, in the center of São Paulo, Brazil, caught fire in the early hours of Tuesday. The building, which was abandoned and was being used by homeless people for shelter, collapsed even as firefighters were trying to bring the flames under control. At least 24 units and 57 firefighter agents were battling the fire when the building collapsed, social media users who witnessed the incident said. As the building collapsed, it ended up burning the building next to it, which was ordered evacuated. The collapse of the building, which appeared to be several floors tall, was caught on camera by a number of witnesses and news reporters who were at the scene. According to Radio BandNews FM, the building was a discarded property of the federal police, and was occupied by a number of homeless people. An unspecified number of people were speculated to be still inside the building when it went up in flames and collapsed. Although the firemen had not confirmed the cause of the fire, preliminary reports suggested it might have started on the fourth floor, following a gas leak and an explosion. It was also not clear how many people were rescued from the building and how many remained trapped under the rubble.
Why Mexico City is so vulnerable to earthquakes  [SEP]  Shortly after noon on Tuesday, an earthquake violently shook the area around Mexico City, collapsing numerous buildings into dust, killing more than 100. The greatest impact was in densely populated Mexico City, but the shaking was even more intense in Puebla, closer to the epicenter. The shaking energy was generated at the earthquake's source, 30 miles deep, for just 20 seconds, but the waves reverberated for much longer, up to a minute or two, in the mountain and valleys. Plate tectonics was the engine behind the shaking, as is true for all major earthquakes. Along the coast of Mexico, the Cocos Plate slides underneath the North American Plate, moving about three inches per year. Tuesday's earthquake, however, was caused by crumpling arising from the downward bending of the sinking Cocos Plate, rather than directly by slippage between plates. A similarly deep but much larger magnitude 8.1-earthquake struck two weeks ago, also from the crumpling of the Cocos Plate. It struck Mexico 400 miles to the southeast and offshore, not far from Guatemala, and killed dozens of people. It is not immediately clear whether Tuesday's earthquake was triggered by the earlier one or if it is unrelated -- usually aftershocks are not so distant in time. In the history of Mexican earthquakes, Tuesday's was coincidentally the 32nd anniversary of the 1985 Michoacan earthquake, which resulted in thousands of deaths. The 1985 earthquake was the more typical great earthquake that breaks the boundary between the plates, and caused great devastation in Mexico City despite being more than 100 miles distant. Mexico City's downtown area is notoriously vulnerable to earthquakes because of the very soft and wet ground underneath. Its soil amplifies shaking like Jell-O on a plate, and is prone to liquefaction, which is the ability to transform dirt into a dense liquid when sufficiently churned. In the 1985 earthquake, many large buildings were destroyed, and Tuesday's quake was another blow mostly to the older, less solidly constructed structures. The cure for earthquake devastation is well known -- fix the old buildings and improve construction methods -- and too complex and expensive to accomplish in less than decades. Mexico has been learning how to deal with this problem the hard way. Its entire Pacific coast is a large and fast moving (that is, moving as fast as fingernails grow-- speedy in plate tectonics terms) plate boundary, often suffering large and great earthquakes. There have been 34 earthquakes bigger than magnitude-7 within 300 miles of Tuesday's quake since 1900. Tuesday's toll indicates there is yet more work to do. Fortunately, Mexico has constructed an "earthquake early warning" system to blunt the tragedy. The system notices shaking very near the epicenter, and sends the news of impending chaos ahead of the shaking. At least some people and some fragile facilities have a little time to communicate and prepare. Initial reports are that the system worked Tuesday. Ironically, the US does not yet have such a system, but is trying to build one. If the government continues to deem it worthwhile, the United States will also have an early warning system in a few years.
Typhoon pummels Japan, flights canceled, trains shut down  [SEP]  TOKYO (AP) — A powerful typhoon ripped through Japan on Sunday, forcing cancellations of flights and trains, including in the Tokyo area as authorities warned of strong winds and torrential rain. Farms and homes in Miyazaki on the southern main island of Kyushu were flooded as Typhoon Trami swept across southwestern Japan. Evacuation orders were issued for tens of thousands of people over a widespread area, including more than 250,000 people in the city of Tokushima on the island of Shikoku, the national broadcaster NHK reported. At least 51 people were injured in southern Japan, it said. Many flights were canceled at major airports throughout Japan, including Tokyo’s Narita and Haneda. The storm destroyed power lines on the southern islands of Okinawa on Saturday. Trami was expected to hit Tokyo late Sunday, and slam northern Japan on Monday. Bullet trains and other train lines were shutting down while the storm passed. Tokyo’s train lines announced they were shutting down after 8 p.m. (11 GMT). The typhoon is projected to hit regions ravaged earlier this month by Typhoon Jebi, which caused landslides and floods and temporarily shuttered Kansai International Airport. The strongest typhoon to hit Japan in 25 years, Jebi caused 11 deaths in and around Osaka. The airport also was closed for this latest typhoon. In July, heavy rain in western Japan killed 221 people, setting off landslides and flooding.
Signs Of Hope At Oroville Dam, After Overflow Sparked Evacuation Sunday  [SEP]  The area around a huge dam at California's second-largest reservoir is in a state of emergency, with some 180,000 residents of the area ordered to evacuate Sunday out of fears that part of Oroville Dam could fail. A glimmer of hope arrived late Sunday night, when officials said water had finally stopped pouring over the dam's emergency spillway. The secondary spillway was in use because the main spillway had developed a huge hole, stressed by the need to release water accumulated from California's wet winter — and brought to a new crisis point by last week's heavy rains. "So the lake rose 50 feet in just a few days," Dan Brekke of member station KQED tells Morning Edition, "and got up to this emergency spillway which had never been used since the dam went into service in 1968. And on Saturday morning, it began pouring over there." Residents of the area some 70 miles north of Sacramento were placed under evacuation orders at around 4:30 p.m. Sunday, after the reservoir rose to a record level — more than a foot above what's considered "full" — and its main spillway struggled to provide relief and its auxiliary spillway was seen at risk of failing. At the time, officials said that dangerous flooding could be just hours away. Even as the evacuation orders were issued, officials had reason to hope that Lake Oroville would soon begin to recede, due to a drop in the amount of runoff water entering the lake and a dry weather forecast. But the reservoir's infrastructure was struggling to cope. "The lake is considered full at 901 feet [above sea level], and it's at that level that it began pouring over an emergency spillway early Saturday," KQED reports. The lake kept rising, surpassing its "full" level by more than a foot. Last night, Lake Oroville's water level finally dropped below 900 feet around midnight, in a trend that has continued into Monday morning. As for the residents and evacuees, Brekke says he has seen many confused, scared people — one woman's son, he says, compared the evacuation to a zombie apocalypse. And another woman said she's still worrying over the family members who weren't able to leave. "My daughter-in-law is still there with her sister, who is bedridden, but we've got her in a wheelchair. They were supposed to be sending an ambulance or someone to help transport her out. And nobody has shown up for her yet. She called 911, and 911 said they weren't sending anybody else out." Overnight, evacuation centers and shelters were still in the process of being outfitted with beds and blankets. Gov. Jerry Brown issued an emergency order last night to help with the process, which saw shelters erected at fairgrounds to handle the thousands of people leaving Oroville and other downstream areas. While the waters are receding and dry weather is expected for Monday and Tuesday, the region in Northern California could get another round of rain later this week, when forecasts are calling for several days of rain. The Oroville Dam incident has sparked questions about how to repair the dam's spillways — and whether other structures in California and beyond are similarly vulnerable. After the main spillway developed a 200-foot hole, the auxiliary spillway also began to erode, sparking Sunday's evacuation. Flood control expert Jeffrey Mount, of the Public Policy Institute of California and the University of California Davis, says the auxiliary spillway at Oroville had never been tested — always a challenge with emergency equipment — and that it will be very expensive to repair. "The weaknesses were revealed immediately in the design, and it threatened to collapse," Mount tells Morning Edition. "I can tell you that this event will cause us to do some soul-searching about the amount of money we're spending on infrastructure — maintenance particularly — here in California," Mount says.
Huawei CFO arrested for violating US trade sanctions  [SEP]  The CFO of Chinese telecom giant Huawei, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Canada on Saturday for allegedly violating US trade sanctions against Iran, reports The Globe and Mail. Wanzhou, who is also the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested in Vancouver over the weekend when she was transferring flights in Canada. She now faces extradition to the US, as, according to Huawei, she’s been chared in the Eastern District of New York. The company noted that it’d been provided with little information on the specifics of the charges, and that its is “not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng.” Following Wanzhou’s arrest, several Chinese companies’ stocks plummeted – including Huawei‘s supplier firms and its main rival, ZTE. News of the incident comes after President Trump signed a bill in August to ban US government agencies from using both Huawei and ZTE‘s telecommunication devices and services. We’ll keep an ear to the ground and update this post as we learn more.

Suspect held after 4 people shot to death in St. Louis-area home  [SEP]  ST. CHARLES, Mo. — Four people were fatally shot inside a St.-Louis-area home, and the suspect exchanged gunfire with police as he fled just after midnight Saturday before being taken into custody just after dawn in a convenience store where he had sought shelter. Three victims were found dead inside the home in St. Charles, Missouri, a city of about 70,000 people on the Missouri River northwest of St. Louis. A fourth victim was taken to a local hospital and died there, said St. Charles Police Lt. Tom Wilkison. Police stopped the suspect as he tried to drive away from the home, and a short gun battle followed. The suspect then fled on foot, tried unsuccessfully to steal a woman’s car, stabbed her and fled again on foot. Her injuries were not life-threatening, authorities said. The suspect was taken into custody at a convenience store a few miles away at about 7:30 a.m. Saturday. He also was injured, and Wilkison said he remained in a local hospital Saturday. Police were called to the scene by a call from within the home a few minutes before midnight Friday, though they were not saying who made it. “During that phone call, the 911 operator could hear gunshots in the background,” Wilkison told The Associated Press. Authorities were not releasing the names of the victims, pending notification of their relatives. They also did not name the suspect or provide details about the weapon he used or his potential motives. Authorities also did not know whether he was injured while exchanging shots with police or at another time. Officers from multiple law enforcement agencies and helicopter and SWAT units converged in the neighbourhood where the shootings occurred and cordoned it off but couldn’t find the suspect. He was reported at the convenience store about seven hours later. “My sense is that he went in there, was seeking shelter. It was really cold last night,” said Capt. Scott Will of the Major Case Squad of Greater St. Louis, leading the investigation.
U.S. scientists able to alter genes of human embryos  [SEP]  U.S. scientists have succeeded in altering the genes of a human embryo to correct a disease-causing mutation, making it possible to prevent the defect from being passed on to future generations. The milestone, reported in a paper released online August 2 in Nature, was confirmed last week by Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), which collaborated with the Salk Institute and Korea's Institute for Basic Science to use a technique known as CRISPR-Cas9 to correct a genetic mutation for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Until now, published studies using the technique had been done in China with mixed results. CRISPR-Cas9 works as a type of molecular scissors that can selectively trim away unwanted parts of the genome, and replace it with new stretches of DNA. "We have demonstrated the possibility to correct mutations in a human embryo in a safe way and with a certain degree of efficiency," said Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a professor in Salk's Gene Expression Laboratory and a co-author of the study. To increase the success rate, his team introduced the genome editing components along with sperm from a male with the targeted gene defect during the in vitro fertilization process. They found that the embryo used the available healthy copy of the gene to repair the mutated part. The Salk/OHSU team also found that its gene correction did not cause any detectable mutations in other parts of the genome - a major concern for gene editing. Still, the technology was not 100 percent successful. It increased the number of repaired embryos from 50%, which would have occurred naturally, to 74%. The embryos, tested in the laboratory, were allowed to develop for only a few days. "There is still much to be done to establish the safety of the methods, therefore they should not be adopted clinically," Robin Lovell-Badge, a professor at London's Francis Crick Institute who was not involved in the study, said in a statement. Washington's National Academy of Sciences (NAS) earlier this year softened its previous opposition to the use of gene editing technology in human embryos, which has raised concerns it could be used to create so-called designer babies. There is also a fear of introducing unintended mutations into germline cells. "No one is thinking about this because it is practically impossible at this point," Izpisua Belmonte said. "This is still very basic research ... let alone something as complex as what nature has done for millions and millions of years of evolution." An international group of 11 organizations, including the American Society of Human Genetics and Britain's Wellcome Trust, on Wednesday issued a policy statement recommending against genome editing that culminates in human implantation and pregnancy, while supporting publicly funded research into its potential clinical applications. Salk's Izpisua Belmonte, emphasizing that much more study is needed, said the most important practical application for the new technology could be in correcting genetic mutations in babies either in utero or right after they are born. "It is crucial that we continue to proceed with the utmost caution, paying the highest attention to ethical considerations," he said.

Slovenia prepares for early election in May after PM quits  [SEP]  LJUBLJANA, March 15 (Reuters) - Slovenia will likely hold an early national election in May, the president's office said on Thursday, after Prime Minister Miro Cerar resigned protesting about legal obstacles to a key development project. Cerar said he had also had enough of pressure from trade unions and what he described as obstruction from coalition partners when he said late on Wednesday he was stepping down. Slovenia was already due to hold elections in June. But President Borut Pahor had decided after meeting Cerar not to nominate an interim prime minister to lead the government until then, his office said. Pahor believed "it is better to call premature parliamentary election" in the last two weeks of May, his office added. That would be the country's third early vote in a row. The presidency said he would hold off formally calling the vote until he met parties and lawmakers next week. They also have the right to nominate an interim prime minister - though that was seen as highly unlikely so close to election day. Cerar resigned hours after the Supreme Court annulled the result of a September referendum that had approved a 1-billion-euro railway project which was the biggest investment project of his centre-left government. He has also faced strikes by public sector workers demanding wage hikes, alongside squabbling in the governing coalition, made up of his Party of Modern Centre, the Social Democrats and the pensioners' party Desus. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry said earlier on Thursday that Cerar's resignation did not pose a significant risk to the economy, as the political system had already been gearing up for an election. The government's macroeconomic institute UMAR on Thursday increased its GDP forecast for 2018 to 5.1 percent from the 3.9 percent forecast in September, saying the economy would be boosted by exports and investments. The yield on Slovenia's 10-year benchmark bond fell to 1.197 percent by 1310 GMT on Thursday from 1.247 percent a day before, according to Reuters data, suggesting investors were keeping their nerve.

Russia kick off World Cup with 5-0 rout of Saudi Arabia  [SEP]  Substitute Denis Cheryshev powered Russia to a 5-0 win over Saudi Arabia here Thursday in the opening match of the 2018 World Cup, the host nation's first international victory since Oct. 7. The result was exactly what Russia needed amid concerns they would struggle to get out of the group stage. Saudi Arabia's strategy of trying to control the ball did not work out. Russia, without putting in an extraordinary performance, led 2-0 by half-time on the strength of Yuri Gazinsky's goal in the 12th minute and the first of Cheryshev's brace in the 43rd. Cheryshev entered the match at the 24-minute mark, replacing the injured Alan Dzagoev. Things went from bad to worse for the Saudis in the second half as Aleksandr Golovin sent a ball into the box, where Artem Dzyuba made the most of it, notching a third goal in the 71st minute. Cheryshev scored his second goal in the 91st and Golovin made it 5-0 in the 92nd, converting on a direct free kick. Russia takes an early lead in Group A, whose other two teams, Uruguay and Egypt, will face each other Friday.
Peru judge orders ex-President Humala jailed before trial  [SEP]  LIMA: A Peruvian judge on Thursday ordered the Andean nation's former President Ollanta Humala and his wife Nadine Heredia to be jailed for up to 18 months while prosecutors prepare formal money laundering charges against them. Judge Richard Concepcion ruled in favour of a request by prosecutor German Juarez, who argued Humala and Heredia should be jailed before trial to prevent them from fleeing or interfering with his nearly three-year investigation. "They're immediate capture internationally is ordered," Concepcion said after handing down his decision. Humala and Heredia deny wrongdoing but were on their way to turning themselves into authorities, their lawyers said after the ruling. "They're not fleeing. They never intended to flee," said defence attorney Wilfredo Pedraza. Juarez accuses Humala and Heredia of taking illegally obtained funds from late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Brazilian construction companies Odebrecht SA and OAS SA that were allegedly used in Humala's campaigns and for personal enrichment. Concepcion's ruling against the couple comes a day after former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison for corruption and is a further blow to the political left in the region. Humala ran an unsuccessful presidential bid in 2006 as an ally of Chavez before winning the 2011 election when he recast himself as a more moderate leftist like Lula. Juarez said the money from Odebrecht and OAS was the product of corruption and the funds from Venezuela were pilfered from that country's treasury. "Here's a president who rose to the presidency and governed us with an electoral campaign built on illicit money. That’s serious," Juarez told Concepcion in a hearing on Wednesday that stretched into early Thursday. The ruling marked the second time that a former Peruvian president has been ordered behind bars since Odebrecht acknowledged in a plea deal with U.S. and Brazilian prosecutors in December that it paid bribes across Latin America over a decade-long period. Peru's centrist former President Alejandro Toledo, believed by Peru to be in the United States, has refused to turn himself in since Concepcion ordered him to be jailed for up to 18 months before a graft trial.
33 dead in second Brazil prison riot in one week  [SEP]  At least 33 inmates are dead following a prison riot in northern Brazil on Friday, officials said, the second prison riot in less than a week in the country. Friday's violence took place at the Agricultural Penitentiary of Monte Cristo, in Brazil's Roraima state in the Amazon, according to Roraima state authorities. The prison is the largest in the state. The rioting began early Friday and military police officers entered the prison to bring the situation under control, state authorities said. In October, 25 people were killed in another riot at the same prison. Sunday, nearly 60 prisoners were killed during a 17-hour uprising at the Anisio Jobim Prison Complex in the city of Manaus, in the neighboring state of Amazonas. The violence on New Year's Day was between incarcerated members of two gangs: the Familia do Norte (FDN) and the Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC). Brazilian Justice Minister Alexandre de Moraes said he doesn't believe the riot at the Monte Cristo prison was in retaliation for last weekend's incident. All the inmates in Friday's violence were from one gang -- the PCC -- who were already separated from rival gangs, Moraes said at a news conference in Brasilia. He spoke at a presentation of the government's new National Security Plan, which he officially launched Thursday with Brazilian President Michel Temer. Moraes said nearly 50% of the prison population in Brazil is made up of "temporary prisoners" -- which includes those awaiting trial and those who have not yet been convicted. Moraes said he hopes to reduce that number to 18% under the new plan. "We need a more rational prison system in Brazil. Our current system, by no fault of anyone specifically, arrests many people but not always the right people," Moraes said. "We have a lot of prisoners who should not be in jail." Brazil has the fourth largest prison population in the world, with more than 622,000 people behind bars, according to its justice ministry. That puts it behind the United States, Russia and China. CNN's Flora Charner reported from Rio de Janeiro, with Chandrika Narayan writing from Atlanta. CNN en Español's Florencia Trucco and CNN's Deborah Bloom also contributed to this report.
Four more boys rescued from Thai cave site  [SEP]  MAE SAI, Thailand -- Four ambulances on Monday left the area around the flooded cave in northern Thailand where members of a youth soccer team have been trapped for more than two weeks, suggesting that a total of eight of the 13 trapped people have now been extracted. Thai officials have been tight-lipped about the rescue operation, and would not comment on how many people were removed Monday. On Sunday, when the high-risk rescue operation to rescue the 12 boys and their coach began, teams of divers brought out four of the boys but waited several hours before confirming their safe rescue. Chiang Rai acting Gov. Narongsak Osatanakorn had said earlier Monday that the second phase began at 11 a.m. and authorities "hope to hear good news in the next few hours." As of Monday morning, nine people remained trapped in the cave, including the team's coach. "All conditions are still as good as they were yesterday," Narongsak told a news conference. "The boys' strength, the plan -- today we are ready like before. And we will do it faster because we are afraid of the rain." Authorities have been rushing to extract the boys, ages 11-16, and their coach from the cave as the annual monsoon bears down on the mountainous region in far northern Chiang Rai province. Workers have been labouring around the clock to pump water out of the cave, and authorities said Monday that heavy downpours overnight did not raise water levels inside. The four boys pulled from the cave Sunday in an urgent and dangerous operation that involved them diving through the cave's dark, tight and twisting passages were happy and in good health, authorities said. "This morning they said they were hungry and wanted to eat khao pad grapao," Narongsak said, referring to a Thai dish of meat fried with chili and basil and served over rice. Still, the four were undergoing medical checks in a hospital in the provincial capital and were not yet allowed close contact with relatives due to fear of infections. Relatives were able to see them through a glass partition, the governor said. The boys and their coach went exploring in the massive Tham Luang Nang Non cave on June 23 after a soccer practice, and were cut off when a rainstorm flooded the cave. A massive international search operation was launched and it took 10 days to locate the boys, who had taken shelter on a dry slope deep in the complex. The search and rescue operation has riveted people both in Thailand and internationally, with journalists from across the globe travelling to this town along the border with Myanmar to report on the ordeal. Interior Minister Anupong Paojinda had said early Monday that the same group of expert divers who took part in Sunday's rescue would return to extricate the others because they know the cave conditions and what to do. He had said fresh air tanks needed to be laid along the underwater route. Authorities have said extracting the entire team from the cave could take up to four days, but Sunday's success raised hopes that it could be done faster. Sunday's mission involved 13 foreign divers and five Thai navy SEALs. Two divers accompanied each of the boys, all of whom have been learning to dive only since July 2, when searchers found them. Cave rescue experts have said they consider an underwater escape to be a last resort, especially with people untrained in diving. The death Friday of a former Thai navy SEAL underscored the risks. The diver, the first fatality of the rescue effort, was working in a volunteer capacity and died on a mission to place air canisters along the passage to where the boys are, necessary for divers to safely travel the five- to six-hour route. There were several concerns that prompted authorities to move forward with the plan to dive the boys out. One was that it was unknown how safe and dry the area where they had taken shelter would stay as Thailand's rainy season, which lasts until at least late October, picks up pace. The other, and perhaps more worrying, was that oxygen levels in the complex were falling close to dangerous levels.
Trump Administration Proposes Regulations To Put Migrant Children In Detention Indefinitely  [SEP]  The Trump administration is proposing to replace a court agreement that limits how long it can hold children in immigration detention. Immigrants rights activists say they'll fight the proposed changes in court. The Trump administration wants to be able to put migrant children in detention facilities indefinitely. Right now, children have to be released from jail-like settings as quickly as possible under the terms of a decades-old court agreement. Administration officials have called that a loophole, and they've made no secret of their desire to get rid of it. Today they proposed regulations that would do just that. Joining me now is NPR's Joel Rose. And, Joel, we've heard a lot about migrant kids being separated from their parents at the Southwest border in recent months. Now what does the government say that it wants to do with them? JOEL ROSE, BYLINE: Well, the Trump administration says it wants to be able to detain migrant families crossing the border illegally and hold them together in detention facilities. When they were separating families, the administration sent the kids to live in less-restrictive shelters. Now the administration has backed off of that policy, as you know. But it doesn't want to release these families either. It wants to detain them until their immigration court hearings. CORNISH: Why didn't they do this before? ROSE: Because of a longstanding agreement called the Flores settlement, which says, among other things, that if kids are detained in jail-like settings, they have to be released quickly. The administration and other immigration hard-liners hate Flores. They say families that are detained after illegally crossing the Southwest border are often released into the U.S. to wait for their day in immigration court and that many of them simply don't show up. And they say that all this is creating an incentive for people to cross illegally with their kids. CORNISH: Can the government just replace Flores with actual regulations? I mean, is it binding? ROSE: The settlement has been enforced for decades. Both the Obama and Trump administrations have tried to get out from under some of its requirements without success. Now the Trump administration is arguing that it can replace Flores with regulations. And they also say they'll continue to provide for these children and treat them with, quote, "dignity." I should note that Flores doesn't just govern how long kids can be held in detention. It also includes all kinds of rules about safety and oversight at detention centers and shelters. CORNISH: What do the immigration attorneys on the other side of that settlement say? ROSE: They're furious. They say that they just can't trust the Trump administration to regulate itself on these matters. They allege that children have already been held under inhumane conditions at the border. Here's one of those immigrant rights activists, Michelle Brane with the Women's Refugee Commission. MICHELLE BRANE: These regulations undermine basic standards of care in any facility that is holding children - migrant children. And that includes the border where we've already seen a lot of abuses. They really are incredibly extensive in terms of how far they go to undermine child protection. CORNISH: So what happens now? ROSE: Immigrant rights activists have already said that they plan to sue to try to block these regulations. So the Trump administration likely has another protracted legal battle on its hands and more controversy about migrant families. Pediatricians and immigrant advocates say that detention is bad for kids. It's bad for their health and development. And so you're likely to see doctors and psychologists also lining up to oppose these regulations during the 60-day comment period that's about to begin. CORNISH: That's NPR's Joel Rose. Thank you for your reporting.
Space Shuttle Rising | International Space Fellowship  [SEP]  What’s that rising from the clouds? The space shuttle. Sometimes, if you look out the window of an airplane at just the right time and place, you see something unusual — in this case a space shuttle launching to orbit. The featured image of Endeavour’s final launch in 2011 May was captured from a NASA shuttle training aircraft. Taken well above the clouds, the image can be matched with similar images of the same shuttle plume taken below the clouds. Hot glowing gasses expelled by the engines are visible near the rising shuttle, as well as a long smoke plume. A shadow of the plume appears on the cloud deck, indicating the direction of the Sun. The US Space Shuttle program concluded in 2011, and Endeavour can now be visited at the California Science Center. Planned for tomorrow, however, is a different launch — that of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.

Dozens Dead as Gunmen Attack Bus carrying Christians in Egypt  [SEP]  TEHRAN (Tasnim) – At least 23 people have been killed and another 25 injured by gunmen who attacked a bus carrying Coptic Christians near the city of Minya, according to Egyptian authorities. The bus was ambushed by unknown gunmen near a Christian monastery on Friday morning and the Egyptian health ministry said there were dozens of casualties. A Coptic activist said the bus and an accompanying car were attacked as they drove along an unpaved road towards the St Samuel monastery, around 140 miles south of Cairo, Telegraph reported. The shooting is the latest in a string of bloody attacks against Egypt’s Coptic minority in the last year, many of them carried out by the Egyptian branch of the Daesh (also known as ISIL or ISIS).
Philippine military: City siege was start of extremist plan – Normangee Star  [SEP]  The military said Monday that seven consecutive days of fighting between government troops and Daesh-linked terrorists in Marawi City had already resulted in the deaths of 100 people. The conclusion of the military operation included a search for Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon, who remained in Marawi, Brig Gen Restituto Padilla, spokesperson for the Armed Forces of the Philippines, told reporters in Malacañang on the seventh day of the crisis. “If we could finish this in one month, then … we end martial law right there and then”, he said. The violence prompted President Rodrigo Duterte last week to declare 60 days of martial law in the southern Philippines, where a Muslim separatist rebellion has raged for decades. Section 18, Article VII of the 1987 Constitution states that Congress, voting jointly and with a simple majority, may revoke or extend the declaration. He said the military was still trying to verify if people were trapped in some parts of the city, after they called a government hotline. “It is an ideology that is totally against the tenets of any religion of peace”, they said. Duterte and military chiefs have said most of the fighters belong to the local Maute group, which they estimate has about 260 armed followers. The military earlier belittled the Maute group until it ambushed a military checkpoint in 2013. Duterte said he can offer revolutionary fighters, who are willing to fight the Maute terror group, the same pay, privileges as the Philippines soldiers. Hapilon, a senior member of the Abu Sayyaf kidnap-for-ransom gang, is on the USA government’s list of most-wanted terrorists. The Moro National Liberation Front appeared to be the only rebel group ready to join the government. “It’s in the interest of the country and that of the people of Marawi that we get him”, he added. Ano said the military, working house to house, had cleared 70 percent of the city as of Tuesday morning and the remaining militants were isolated. “And Cardinal Quevedo, being from Mindanao, made a pastoral statement approving the martial law in Mindanao, and I respect that very much and share his sentiments”, he said in an interview after he presided over the Requiem Mass for Cebuano Monsignor Alfeo Manalili at the Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral. ILIGAN city was placed under a temporary lockdown amid fears that members of the Maute Group may enter the city disguised as civilians. In recent days, the terrorists have managed to fend off attack helicopters, armoured vehicles and scores of soldiers. The terrorist attack in Marawi City, which prompted President Rodrigo Roa Duterte to declare martial law in the whole of Mindanao and compelled him to cut short his official visit to Russian Federation, was a very unfortunate event as it happened amid the President’s latest effort to open new markets and sources of investments for the Philippines.

Jerusalem's famed Israel Museum gets new director  [SEP]  JERUSALEM (AP) — The Israel Museum in Jerusalem has selected a successor to its longtime director. The museum says in an announcement on Tuesday that Eran Neuman will take over from James Snyder who is ending his 20-year tenure to assume the newly created position of international president for the museum’s worldwide activities. Neuman, who currently serves as Director of the David Azrieli School of Architecture at Tel Aviv University, was unanimously chosen by the museum’s board of directors. Snyder is credited with transforming the institution into a world-class museum. Annual attendance doubled to more than 800,000 during his tenure. Founded in 1965, the museum’s collections range from prehistory to contemporary art and include the most extensive holdings of Biblical and Holy Land archaeology in the world, among them the Dead Sea Scrolls.
Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announces west Mosul offensive  [SEP]  The Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on Sunday, (19 February) announced the launch of a ground offensive in western Mosul to drive the Islamic State (Isis) out of the area. "We announce the start of a new phase in the operation, we are coming to Nineveh to liberate the western side of Mosul. Our forces are beginning the liberation of the citizens from the terror of Daesh [IS]," he added. The Iraqi air force has reportedly dropped leaflets on western Mosul warning its residents of an impending ground offensive to oust the IS (Daesh) from the area, the Iraqi defence ministry said in a statement, Reuters reported. The statement said the leaflets "contain instructions for the citizens to get ready to welcome the Iraqi forces that are coming to liberate their areas and to warn the Daesh (Islamic State) members to lay down their weapons and surrender". At least 650,000 civilians in western Mosul are under siege along with the Isis militants. The US backed Iraqi forces were successful in ousting the terrorist group from the eastern part of Mosul in a battle that came to an end in January and now have all but surrounded the western side. Meanwhile, the United Nations has warned that the safety of the thousands of civilians trapped in the area is a top priority. Lise Grande, the UN humanitarian co-ordinator for Iraq told the BBC that it had made the safety of civilians its top priority when the Iraqi forces waged an offensive to take back eastern Mosul. She added that the Iraqi forces "need to ensure that that humanitarian concept of operations is adhered to, and that all of the parties to the conflict do absolutely everything they can to ensure that civilians survive the battle, and that they live." "Absolutely nothing is more important going into the campaign to retake western Mosul," Grande said. According to reports, retaking western Mosul could prove to be a bigger challenge due to its narrow streets.
YouTube punishes US blogger Japanese suicide video – but he’s still worth US$15m  [SEP]  YouTube has punished star US blogger Logan Paul over a video that appeared to show him giggling after discovering a dead body in a Japanese forest notorious for suicides. The company said in a statement that it has removed Paul’s channels from the Google Preferred advertising system and will not feature him in the new season of the web series “Foursome.” It said his new video blogs are also on hold. Paul, who has a net worth of US$15m (HK$117m) according to Forbes, earlier announced he was stepping away from posting videos “to reflect” following an outcry when he uploaded images of the apparent body and his reaction to finding it in the forest. But he still made up to US$90,000 (HK$704,000) from his monetised “Tokyo Adventures” YouTube series even during the controversy, The Telegraph reported. YouTube prohibits violent or gory content posted in a shocking, sensational or disrespectful manner, the company says. It issued a “strike” against Paul’s channel for violating its community guidelines after the posting. In the video, Paul – whose other videos from Japan showed him throwing Pokemon balls at strangers and waving dead fist at passers-by – is seen discovering a hanging corpse in the forest. He can be heard giggling as the camera lingers over the corpse, but is later seen looking shocked while wearing a bright-green Toy Story hat. The video was viewed some 6 million times before being removed from Paul’s YouTube channel, a verified account with more than 15 million subscribers. Anger over Logan Paul’s apologies for his controversial video A storm of criticism followed despite two apologies, with commenters saying Paul seemed disrespectful and that his initial apology was inadequate. Paul, who has parlayed his YouTube popularity into television guest spots and hosting roles at teen awards shows, now faces a difficult path forward for his career. Google Preferred’s advertising programme aggregates top YouTube content for advertisers to buy time on them.
Russia Kemerovo fire: Vladimir Putin calls mall fire 'criminal negligence', vows pinishment  [SEP]  Moscow: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday said the shopping mall fire that claimed 64 lives, including those of 41 children, was caused by “criminal negligence” and all those responsible for it would be punished. The horrific fire started on the top floor of the four-storey Winter Cherry shopping mall on Sunday in Kemerovo, located in southern Siberia around 3,000 km east of Moscow. Most of the victims were children as the mall’s shops, cinema and bowling alley were packed due to school holidays. Visiting the scene in Kemerovo, Putin berated “sloppiness” and told relatives of the victims that there would be a thorough investigation into the incident and those responsible would be punished, TASS news agency reported. “A 100-member investigative group is working here, headed by the Investigative Committee chief. Rest assured, all those responsible will be punished,” he said. The inferno engulfed a children’s trampoline room and a cinema hall on the fourth floor. Russia’s Investigative Committee (ICR) in a statement cited “serious violations” and said a fire safety technician at the complex “switched off the alarm system” after being alerted about the fire. It said a criminal investigation into the cause of the fire had begun, although reports suggested that it could have been started by a child misusing a cigarette lighter or malfunctioning electrical wires. Out of 64 bodies, 25 were identified which included 13 children, TASS reported. “The bodies of 13 children who died in the fire have been identified,” Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said. She also said that experts started DNA tests required for identifying the bodies of those who died in the deadly inferno. An official in the emergency services said that another 68 people were injured and poisoned with combustion products. Putin visited the injured in Kemerovo’s regional hospital. Interfax news agency reported that some 300 people gathered outside the local government headquarters demanding the dismissal of authorities. “What is happening here?”, the Russian President said after laying a wreath at the scene. “This is no battle or an unexpected methane outburst in a mine.” “People, children came to relax. We are talking about demography and are losing so many people because of what? Because of criminal negligence, sloppiness,” he said. Five people were arrested including the official suspected of deactivating the public address system. The Kemerovo region will observe three days of mourning starting on Tuesday. “The mourning will last for three days from March 27 to 29. The corresponding order was signed by Governor Aman Tuleyev. The state flags of the Russian Federation and the flags of the region will be lowered on the whole territory of the Kemerovo region,” an official statement said. All institutions, organisations, TV and radio companies were asked to cancel recreational activities. Meanwhile, the head of the city’s fire department Sergei Yakovlev said that the blaze had spread via flammable thermal insulation that complicated the process of extinguishing the inferno.
Blast Near Bogota Bullring Injures 31, Many of Them Police, Reports Say  [SEP]  An explosion Sunday near the Santamaria bullfighting ring in downtown Bogota, Colombia, injured at least 31 people, many of them policemen, according to reports. Two of the 31 were seriously injured, Mayor Enrique Peñalosa tweeted. At least 10 police officers were hurt, according to the Bogota police press office. A dozen suspects were taken into custody, the press office said. “The terrorists won’t intimidate us. And we’re going to do everything necessary to capture them,” Peñalosa said in another tweet. Footage aired by Medellin-based Cable Noticias showed dozens of police in fluorescent yellow jackets converging at the base of a highrise near the plaza, blocking off streets and directing pedestrians away from the scene. The stadium is located in the La Macarena neighborhood of the Colombian capital. It was not clear who was behind Sunday’s blast. Bullfighting has long been a contentious issue in Colombia. On one side are Colombians who say the events are art, part of the country’s culture and tradition. Opponents call it animal abuse, and say they want the city-owned bullring to be converted into a space for cultural and educational events. In 2012, then-Bogota Mayor Gustavo Petro essentially banned bullfighting by suspending the city’s contract with the Bullfighting Corporation of Bogota. But the constitutional court overturned Petro’s decision, siding with those who say bullfighting is a form of artistic expression. Bullfights are held on Sundays in January and February in Colombia. Bogota held its first bullfight in four years in January, and hundreds of protesters converged on the Santamaria bullring, with various media reporting the demonstrators hurled obscenities, spit at attendees and called them “torturers.” Riot police had to intervene. Peñalosa has said he opposes bullfighting but is bound by the constitutional court’s decision to allow it. After the explosion, he tweeted that the area was secure and it was safe to attend the event. According to Humane Society International, about 250,000 bulls are killed during these events annually. Colombia is one of eight countries — joining Spain, France, Portugal, Mexico, Venezuela, Peru and Ecuador — where bullfighting is legal, the organization reports. A change.org petition aimed at persuading the constitutional court to overturn its ruling and end bullfighting in Colombia garnered almost 52,000 signatures.
Filipinos in the Navy support Duterte. His US policy? Not so much  [SEP]  Filipinos in the Navy support Duterte. His US policy? Not so much YOKOSUKA NAVAL BASE, Japan — Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s call to remove foreign troops from his country has left many Filipino-American sailors torn between sympathy for the president’s domestic goals and opposition to weakening the security partnership with the U.S. The Navy long represented a goal for Filipinos looking for a better life; between 1952 and 1990, about 34,260 Filipinos enlisted under a recruitment program that let them join without first immigrating. Filipinos continue to seek enlistment, while many Filipino-Americans have made the Navy a generational tradition. They now fill ranks from seaman to vice admiral. When the 7th Fleet flagship USS Blue Ridge arrived in Manila for a March port visit, roughly 15 percent of its crew had Filipino ancestry. Some sailors on 7th Fleet ships remain Filipino citizens. Duterte’s insults directed at U.S. officials, along with his demands that the U.S. military abandon anti-terror efforts and halt plans to share space at Philippine military bases, have left many in a quandary. Petty Officer 3rd Class Roland Donato, 25, is wary of Duterte’s lurch toward China. Duterte announced his “separation” from the U.S. last week in Beijing, though he later said he would not seek to end the U.S.-Philippines security alliance, which was formalized 65 years ago. Donato doubted that China would prove as valuable a friend as the U.S. when it comes to fighting terrorism, which remains a particular problem in the south. “Straying away from the U.S., that is not OK,” said Donato, who grew up in the northern city of Baguio and moved to the U.S. at age 18. “All the exercises the U.S. do are to deter terror, that’s why we are here. I don’t think that’s a mission of China. “Breaking away from the U.S is like saying you don’t want to be part of deterring terror.” But other than that, despite international criticism over extrajudicial street killings resulting from Duterte’s national drug war, Donato and others voiced enthusiastic support for the recently elected president. While multiple conversations with sailors started with foreign policy, they quickly turned to public safety concerns in the Philippines. The turn largely mirrored concerns among Filipinos. Duterte ran his election campaign on an anti-crime platform, with little emphasis on security issues. Donato grew up in a relatively safe neighborhood but says he knows people victimized by muggings and street crime. If Duterte’s methods are extreme, it’s because of the depth of the problem, he said. “They’ve always had a problem with corruption back home,” “I like his goals — his intentions are good.” Duterte may have a good plan to work with both the U.S. and China – but if he does, he hasn’t shared it, said Jiyo Montanez, 20, a Navy family member. Montanez, an American born to parents from Manila, called Duterte the first Filipino president to shed the “colonial mentality” that continued long after the U.S. relinquished control in 1946. “His mindset isn’t ‘Don’t upset the U.S,’ but, ‘Who cares if the U.S. is upset, this is my country and I’ll do what’s best,’” Montanez said. U.S. State Department officials have criticized Duterte over thousands of street deaths associated with the new leader’s war on drugs. Duterte told a news conference in September that he would be “happy to slaughter” 3 million drug addicts to end the problem. Police statistics show 1,578 drug suspects shot dead by security forces since Duterte took office in June, according to The Associated Press. Another 864 people have been killed by motorcycle-riding gunmen, a hallmark of vigilante groups, with many more murders classified as “unexplained.” “If the president is really serious about justice, he should put more thought into investigating extrajudicial killings,” Montanez said. However, Montanez also said Duterte’s campaign also has saved lives. When he hears from his relatives in the Philippines, they say they feel safer now. Petty Officer 2nd Class Frederick Santos, 27, grew up in Quezon City and immigrated to the U.S. at 19. Santos liked Duterte from the start and feels he will help the nation’s poor. “At the same time, I don’t think it’s a good idea to cut ties with the U.S., because the U.S. helps the Philippines,” Santos said. “There are many Filipinos in the U.S. who support him but are not going to like that.” Duterte’s jabs at Americans, whom he has called loud and discourteous, among other things, are making some Filipinos uncomfortable as well. “My cousin is married to an American, and she said she won’t bring her husband to the [Philippines] because Duterte is anti-American,” Santos said. Petty Officer 3rd Class Daniel Aldana supports getting drug dealers off the streets but isn’t sure whether to take Duterte’s sometimes-contradictory statements about aligning with China and Russia seriously. Aldana, born in California to Filipino parents, said he is surprised at just how solidly pro-Duterte many of his friends in the Navy appear. “[Duterte] is prideful, but I feel that that pride is too much,” Aldana said. “Sometimes what he thinks might be right is not always the right choice.” Seaman Jeric Andaya, born in Hawaii to Filipino parents, said he thinks the overall U.S.-Philippines relationship remains strong, despite Duterte’s stances. If that remains the case, then little will have changed from last year, when 92 percent of Filipinos viewed the U.S. favorably -- higher than any other country surveyed, according to a Pew survey. “I haven’t gone to the Philippines yet,” Andaya said. “I know a lot of our ships go there … I hope to come there someday.”

Hundreds arrested as protesters rally across Russia in new challenge to Kremlin  [SEP]  Tens of thousands of protesters held anti-corruption rallies across Russia on Monday in a new show of defiance by an opposition that the Kremlin had once dismissed as ineffectual and marginalized. More than a thousand were arrested — including opposition leader and protest organizer Alexei Navalny, who was seized outside his Moscow residence while heading to the rally in the city centre and sentenced to 30 days in jail several hours later. The Moscow protest was the most prominent in a string of more than 100 rallies in cities and towns stretching through all 11 of Russia’s time zones — from the Pacific to the European enclave of Kaliningrad — with many denouncing President Vladimir Putin. Thousands of angry demonstrators thronged to Tverskaya Street, a main avenue in the capital, chanting “Down with the czar” and singing the Russian national anthem. The protests coincided with Russia Day, a national holiday that this year brought out historical re-enactors, some of them dressed in medieval costumes. At one point, the Moscow demonstration featured an unlikely scene of about 5,000 protesters rallying next to an enclosure with geese, a medieval catapult and bearded men in homemade tunics and carrying wooden shields. The re-enactors watched the rally before riot police broke up the crowd and randomly seized the protesters. Over 800 people were arrested in Moscow, while in St. Petersburg, about 500 were forced into police buses at an unsanctioned rally that drew up to 10,000 people. Navalny was taken to court Monday evening and sentenced to 30 days in jail shortly after midnight for repeated violations of the law on public gatherings. “The scope of the rallies was amazing, and so many people came out,” Navalny told reporters shortly before he was sentenced, point to protest rallies held in towns which have not seen any public show of discontent for decades. In his trademark humour, Navalny lamented on Twitter shortly before he was led out of the courtroom that he would have to skip a Depeche Mode concert while he is in jail. The demonstrators appeared to skew predominantly younger — those who were born or grew up during Putin’s 17 years in power. Similar crowds turned out on March 26, rattling officials who had perceived the younger generation as largely apolitical. Three 16-year-old girls brought sheets of paper to the Moscow protest and sat on the pavement to write the articles of the Russian Constitution on them; a nearby group of teenagers climbed atop of a tent with posters saying, “Corruption kills the future.” Other protesters scaled a scaffold and hung a sign saying, “Only revolution will defeat corruption.” School and university staff who reportedly reprimanded their students for attending the March protests warned them against going to Monday’s rally. Ivan Sukhoruchenkov, 19, attended anyway with four university classmates to protest what he described as “stagnation of the political system.” “Change is always good,” Sukhoruchenkov said, adding that he and his friends were concerned about corruption — Navalny’s rallying cry — that “manifests itself in all areas: from traffic police to university professors.” Navalny had called the anti-corruption demonstrations, and they drew crowds of several dozen to the 10,000 in St. Petersburg. Some of the rallies were sanctioned by authorities and peaceful, but police cracked down brutally on others. Although it was not immediately clear if Monday’s protests were larger than those in March, they underlined the deep dismay with the government. Putin is expected to seek another term in 2018, and Navalny has already announced his intentions to run. Moscow officials had agreed to allow Navalny’s rally, but late Sunday, he said official interference had prevented contractors from erecting a stage at the agreed-upon venue and instead urged demonstrators to gather on Tverskaya Street, which was closed to traffic for the Russia Day festivities. Most of the Moscow protesters appeared to be under 30, although there was a sizeable number of middle-aged people and couples with children. With opposition sentiment strong or even growing, authorities appear to be seeking a strategy to undermine the opposition without provoking more animosity. Authorities allowed the unsanctioned rally to proceed, although riot police cut the crowd in half and began pushing the lines while grabbing some people from the crowd. Some of the arrests were violent with police using batons and dragging people along the street. In Washington, White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters the United States “strongly condemns the detention of hundreds of peaceful protesters” which he described as an “affront to core democratic values.” Spicer called on the Russian government to immediately release all peaceful protesters. Navalny rose to prominence for detailed open-source investigations of government corruption. That was a key issue Monday for protesters, particularly his report on vast wealth allegedly acquired by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. “We are against the corruption that is costing the future of our young people,” said Moscow protester Maria Badyrova, a 33-year-old finance specialists who came to the rally with a Russian flag. Alexei Borsenko, a Vladivostok demonstrator who eluded a police attempt to detain him, cited Iceland’s prime minister stepping down in the fallout from the “Panama Papers” scandal, while “our prime minister is caught on such big corruption cases and he doesn’t go anywhere.” “This is very strange,” Borsenko added. “It’s a dead end for the country’s development.” The popular anger has spread beyond Medvedev, with many demonstrators chanting “Putin is a thief” within earshot of the City Hall that later dismissed the protests as an “overt provocation.”
Trump administration moves to ban bump stocks  [SEP]  WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration moved Tuesday to officially ban bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire rapidly like automatic firearms, and has made them illegal to possess beginning in late March. The devices will be banned under a federal law that prohibits machine guns, according to a senior Justice Department official. Bump stocks became a focal point of the national gun control debate after they were used in October 2017 when a man opened fired from his Las Vegas hotel suite into a crowd at a country music concert below, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The regulation, which was signed by Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker on Tuesday morning, will go into effect 90 days after it is formally published in the Federal Register, which is expected to happen on Friday, the Justice Department official said. The official wasn't authorized to discuss the matter publicly ahead of the regulation's formal publication and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. In March, President Donald Trump said his administration would "ban" the devices, which he said "turn legal weapons into illegal machines." Shortly after the president's comments, the Justice Department announced that it had started the process to amend federal firearms regulations to define bump stocks as machine guns. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives sought public comment on the proposal, drawing more than 35,000 comments. The amended regulations reverse a 2010 ATF decision that found bump stocks did not amount to machine guns and could not be regulated unless Congress changed existing firearms law or passed a new one. In the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting, there was a growing push by some members of Congress to ban bump stocks, but no legislation was passed. At least 10 states have sought their own restrictions on the devices. People who own bump stocks will be required to either surrender them to the ATF or destroy them by late March, the official said. The change has undergone a legal review and the Justice Department and ATF are ready to fight any legal challenge that may be brought, the official added. The amended rule was met almost immediately with resistance from gun rights advocates, including Gun Owners of America, which said it would file a lawsuit against the Justice Department and ATF in order to protect gun owners from the "unconstitutional regulations." "These regulations implicate Second Amendment rights, and courts should be highly suspect when an agency changes its 'interpretation' of a statute in order to impair the exercise of enumerated constitutional rights," the organization's executive director, Erich Pratt, said. Police said the gunman in the Las Vegas massacre, Stephen Paddock, fired for more than 10 minutes using multiple weapons outfitted with target scopes and bump stocks. Paddock fatally shot himself after the shooting and there were 23 assault-style weapons, including 14 fitted with rapid-fire "bump stock" devices, strewn about the room near his body on the floor of his 32nd-floor hotel suite at the Mandalay Bay casino-hotel. The largest manufacturer of bump stocks, Slide Fire Solutions, announced in April that it was going to stop taking orders and shutting down its website. The remaining stock of the devices is now being sold by another company, RW Arms, based in Fort Worth, Texas. Associated Press writer Lisa Marie Pane in Boise, Idaho, contributed to this report.
White House condemns violence in Ukraine, pressures Yanukovich  [SEP]  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday condemned Ukrainian authorities’ response to demonstrators in Kiev and urged President Viktor Yanukovich to listen to the Ukrainian people and return the country to a path toward European integration. “The right to peaceful protest and assembly must be respected. Violence of this sort that we have seen on the streets of Kiev is impermissible in a democratic state,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest told a briefing. Earnest said lines of communication between the U.S. government and Ukraine’s government remained open.
China house fire kills 22 in Jiangsu province  [SEP]  At least 22 people have died after a fire broke out in a two-storey house in eastern China, state media report. Another three people were injured in the city of Changshu, north-west of Shanghai, Xinhua news agency says. It says the fire - that started at about 04:30 local time (20:30 GMT Saturday) - has been put out. It was not immediately known how many people lived in the building in Jiangsu province. An investigation into what caused the blaze is now under way.
A Look At The Top Contenders For The Supreme Court  [SEP]  MIAMI (CBSMiami/AP) — President Donald Trump’s announcement for his pick to take a vacant spot in the Supreme Court is set for Tuesday evening. Neil Gorsuch, Thomas Hardiman and William Pryor are the three federal appeals court judges who are seen as the leading candidates. Each was appointed to the appellate bench by President George W. Bush. Each appeared on Trump’s list of 21 possible choices that he made public during the campaign, and each has met with Trump to discuss the vacancy that arose when Justice Antonin Scalia died nearly a year ago. Gorsuch, 49, serves on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, where he has made a name for himself as a graceful writer. Gorsuch is a graduate of Columbia University and Harvard Law School, and served as a law clerk to Justices Anthony Kennedy and fellow Coloradan Byron White. If chosen, he would be the first justice to serve with a colleague for whom he once worked. With a clear, colloquial writing style, Gorsuch has written in favor of courts’ second-guessing government regulations, in defense of religious freedom and skeptically about law enforcement. He has contended that courts give too much deference to government agencies’ interpretations of statutes. He sided with two groups that mounted religious objections to the Obama administration’s requirements that employers provide health insurance that includes contraception for women. He is the son of President Ronald Reagan’s Environmental Protection Agency chief, Anne Gorsuch. He worked for two years in Bush’s Justice Department before Bush appointed him to his appeals court seat. He was confirmed by a voice vote in 2006. Gorsuch has written 175 majority opinions and 65 concurrences or dissents in his decade on the 10th Circuit, according to Rebecca Love Kourlis, a former Colorado Supreme Court justice. Gorsuch also is a notable advocate for simplifying the justice system to make it more accessible, Kourlis said. Gorsuch is also an avid skier, fly fisherman and horseback rider, Kourlis said. He teaches at the University of Colorado’s law school in Boulder. Hardiman, 51, works in Pittsburgh as a judge on the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. He drove a taxi to support himself during his undergraduate years at the University of Notre Dame. He received his law degree from Georgetown University. Hardiman became a partner in a major law firm at age 30 and a federal district judge at 38. The Senate confirmed him 95-0 to his current job in April 2007. His prominent opinions on the appeals court include siding with jails seeking to strip search inmates arrested for even minor offenses and backing the collection of genetic evidence from people at the time of their arrest. Hardiman has supported gun rights, dissenting in a 2013 case that upheld a New Jersey law to strengthen requirements to carry a handgun in public. Hardiman last year joined two 3rd Circuit colleagues in affirming the $1 billion settlement of NFL concussion claims, rejecting complaints that men with depression and mood disorders that some link to football concussions were left out of the deal. In earlier oral arguments. The Supreme Court later refused to hear the challengers’ appeal. Hardiman was raised in Waltham, Massachusetts, and eventually settled in Pittsburgh, where his wife comes from a family of prominent Democrats. The Hardimans have three children. Pryor, 54, has his office in Birmingham, Alabama, where his sits as a judge on the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. He’s been on the court since 2004, when Bush gave him a temporary recess appointment to get around Democratic opposition in the Senate. He was confirmed by a 53-45 vote in 2005, part of a bipartisan deal to limit Senate delays of appellate nominations. Pryor has a reputation as staunch conservative. He once called the 1973 landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion the “worst abomination in the history of constitutional law.” On the bench, Pryor has often ruled against criminal defendants. He authored a majority opinion upholding a border patrol agent’s decision to stop a SUV filled with Hispanic passengers because the vehicle was driving erratically and the occupants appeared nervous. He also ruled that a Supreme Court decision banning automatic life sentences for juvenile defendants should not be applied to older cases. The high court later disagreed, ruling that the decision did apply retroactively. On religious freedom, in 2014, he wrote a separate opinion in favor of a Catholic television station that objected to the contraception coverage mandate of the Affordable Care Act. The son of two teachers, Pryor traced the roots of his conservatism to his staunch Catholic upbringing. He said the abortion ruling, handed down when he was a boy, influenced his decision to become a Republican and a lawyer. Pryor grew up in Mobile, Alabama, and graduated from Tulane Law School in New Orleans. He was a law clerk to Judge John Minor Wisdom, whose rulings helped end segregation. Pryor was appointed Alabama’s attorney general at age 34. He succeeded Jeff Sessions, the Alabama senator nominated to be Trump’s attorney general.
Kellyanne Conway found to have violated Hatch Act twice  [SEP]  An independent government investigative agency said on Tuesday that senior counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway twice violated a federal law prohibiting government employees from engaging in political activities. The Office of Special Counsel (OSC), which is in not affiliated with special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, announced Tuesday that Conway violated the Hatch Act in two television interviews. "In the first interview, Conway advocated against one Senate candidate and gave an implied endorsement of another candidate," the OSC said in a statement following its investigation. "In the second interview, she advocated for the defeat of one Senate candidate and the election of another candidate." The interviews occurred last November and December when President Donald Trump came out in support of Judge Roy Moore in Alabama's U.S. Senate special election. Conway appeared in her official capacity as counselor to the president on both "Fox and Friends" and CNN's "New Day" and "discussed why voters should support" Moore over his Democratic opponent Doug Jones, the OSC said. “Ms. Conway’s statements during the Fox & Friends and New Day interviews impermissibly mixed official government business with political views about candidates in the Alabama special election for U.S. Senate,” according to the OSC. The OSC says it has referred its report to President Trump, who has full discretion over whether Conway will face any type of disciplinary action. “Kellyanne Conway did not advocate for or against the election of any particular candidate. She simply expressed the President’s obvious position that he have people in the House and Senate who support his agenda," deputy press Secredtary Hogan Gidely said. "In fact, Kellyanne’s statements actually show her intention and desire to comply with the Hatch Act – as she twice declined to respond to the host’s specific invitation to encourage Alabamans to vote for the Republican.” Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, wants the president to take disciplinary action against Conway: “This is not the first time that an independent government agency has recommended that the White House discipline Kellyanne Conway for breaking the law. Ms. Conway has received multiple trainings and warnings, yet she still refuses to follow basic ethics rules. The President must take swift and serious disciplinary action against Ms. Conway. Anything else sets a terrible example.” According to the OSC's website, the Hatch Act dates back to 1939, and is intended "to ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion, to protect federal employees from political coercion in the workplace, and to ensure that federal employees are advanced based on merit and not based on political affiliation." There are a few exceptions to the rule, including the president, vice president and some other federal employees. In early 2017 Conway was similarly found to have violated federal ethics rules in an appearance on "Fox and Friends" when she urged viewers to purchase items from Ivanka Trump's clothing line. A report from the Office of Government Ethics was then referred to the president, but no significant disciplinary action was taken as a response. Conway is also not the first Trump White House official to be found in violation of the Hatch Act. Social media director Dan Scavino was issued a warning by the OSC after writing a tweet from his personal verified account against Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., calling for his defeated in a primary.
North Korea conducts fifth and largest nuclear test - VnExpress International  [SEP]  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un meets scientists and technicians in the field of research into nuclear weapons in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang March 9, 2016. Photo by KCNA/Files via Reuters. North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test on Friday and said it had mastered the ability to mount a warhead on a ballistic missile. Its most powerful explosion to date follows a test in January that prompted the U.N. Security Council to impose tightened sanctions that increased North Korea's isolation but failed to prevent it from accelerating weapons development. South Korean President Park Geun-hye, in Laos after a summit of Asian leaders ended there on Thursday, said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was showing "maniacal recklessness" in completely ignoring the world's call to abandon his pursuit of nuclear weapons. U.S. President Barack Obama, aboard Air Force One on his way home from Laos, said the test would be met with "serious consequences" and held talks with Park and with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the White House said. China, North Korea's only major diplomatic ally, said it was resolutely opposed to the test and urged Pyongyang to stop taking any actions that would worsen the situation. North Korea, which labels the South and the United States as its main enemies, said its "scientists and technicians carried out a nuclear explosion test for the judgment of the power of a nuclear warhead," according to a report from its official KCNA news agency. North Korea said the test proved it is capable of mounting a nuclear warhead on a medium-range ballistic missile, which it last tested on Monday when Obama and other world leaders were gathered in China for a G20 summit. Its claims of being able to miniaturize a nuclear warhead have never been independently verified. North Korea has been testing missiles at an unprecedented rate this year, and the capability to mount a nuclear warhead on a missile is especially worrisome for its neighbors South Korea and Japan. "The standardization of the nuclear warhead will enable the DPRK to produce at will and as many as it wants a variety of smaller, lighter and diversified nuclear warheads of higher strike power," KCNA said, referring to the country's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Japan Defense Minister Tomomi Inada said the Pyongyang regime's advances in mobile ballistic missile technology posed a grave threat to Japan. North Korea's nuclear test coincided with the anniversary of its 1948 foundation as a republic. Its continued testing despite sanctions presents a severe challenge to Obama in the final months of his presidency and could become a factor in the U.S. presidential election in November. "Sanctions have already been imposed on almost everything possible, so the policy is at an impasse," said Tadashi Kimiya, a University of Tokyo professor specializing in Korean issues. "In reality, the means by which the United States, South Korea and Japan can put pressure on North Korea have reached their limits," he said. Japan's Abe said such a nuclear test could not be tolerated. Japan's foreign minister lodged a protest and Tokyo also sent two military jets to begin measuring for radiation. China's environment ministry began emergency radiation monitoring along its borders with North Korea in northeast China, state television reported. Jeffrey Lewis of the California-based Middlebury Institute of International Studies said the highest estimates of seismic magnitude suggested this was the most powerful nuclear test conducted by North Korea so far. He said the seismic magnitude and surface level indicated a blast with a 20- to 30-kiloton yield. Such a yield would make this test larger than the nuclear bomb dropped by the United States on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in World War Two and potentially bigger than that dropped on Nagasaki soon after. "That's the largest DPRK test to date, 20-30kt, at least. Not a happy day," Lewis told Reuters. "The important thing is that five tests in, they now have a lot of nuclear test experience. They aren't a backwards state any more," he said. > Kim Jong Un says missile gives North Korea ability to attack U.S. in Pacific
Theresa May Calls for New Election in Britain, Seeking Stronger ‘Brexit’ Mandate  [SEP]  But the decision does carry political risks for Mrs. May. For a politician who has cultivated a reputation as a straight shooter who puts country before party, the about-face on early elections could smack of opportunism. And in a year of election surprises, embittered but highly motivated voters from the Remain camp could coalesce behind one of the parties to register their anger over leaving the bloc. “She presents herself as someone putting the national interest first, before her party, and someone who does not play political games,” said Steven Fielding, a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham. “It might bite her, but she’ll play the stability-versus-instability card.” Mrs. May apparently calculated that the risks of an early vote were small compared with the possible payoff from a strengthened Conservative hold over Parliament. Mrs. May took office less than a year ago, when her Conservative predecessor, David Cameron quit after losing the June 23 referendum on British membership in the European Union. Chosen by the Tories to become prime minister when her most obvious rivals fell away, Mrs. May is now seeking an electoral mandate of her own to deal with her real danger: an unhappy group of anti-European Conservative legislators who are opposed to anything that might smell of compromise with the European Union. Without an early vote, Mrs. May said, “the negotiations with the European Union will reach their most difficult stage in the run-up to the next scheduled election,” in 2020. She added, “Division in Westminster will risk our ability to make a success of Brexit, and it will cause damaging uncertainty and instability to the country.” Analysts generally praised her decision to call early elections. “This is the act of a rational politician, but one who had repeatedly promised not to call an early election,” Mr. Fielding said. “But her lead in the polls can only go down as soon as Brexit negotiations start, so why not go now?”
2 inmates charged with killing 4 in South Carolina prison  [SEP]  COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Two convicts each serving a life sentence for killing a mother and her child have been charged with murder in the strangulation deaths of four inmates inside a South Carolina prison. Arrest warrants released early Saturday say 35-year-old Denver Simmons and 25-year-old Jacob Philip lured each inmate into a cell at Kirkland Correctional Institution in Columbia on Friday morning. The warrants say the men worked together to choke all four inmates. Two of the victims were also beaten and stabbed with a broken broomstick. The warrants gave no reason for the attack or how long the killings took. Prison officials are investigating the attack and have not commented. The warrants say there is video. It wasn’t known if the inmates had lawyers.
Obama cancels meeting with new Philippine President Duterte  [SEP]  President Barack Obama called off a planned meeting Tuesday with new Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, seeking distance from a U.S. ally's leader during a diplomatic tour that's put Obama in close quarters with a cast of contentious world figures. It's unusual for one president to tell another what to say or not say, and much rarer to call the other a "son of a bitch." Duterte managed to do both just before flying to Laos for a regional summit, warning Obama not to challenge him over extrajudicial killings in the Philippines. "Clearly, he's a colorful guy," Obama said. "What I've instructed my team to do is talk to their Philippine counterparts to find out is this in fact a time where we can have some constructive, productive conversations." Early Tuesday, National Security Council spokesman Ned Price said the meeting with Duterte was off. Duterte has been under intense global scrutiny over the more than 2,000 suspected drug dealers and users killed since he took office. Obama had said he planned to raise the issue in his first meeting with Duterte, but the Philippine leader insisted he was only listening to his own country's people. "You must be respectful," Duterte said of Obama. "Do not just throw questions." Using the Tagalog phrase for "son of a bitch," he said, "Putang ina I will swear at you in that forum." He made the comment to reporters in Manilla. Eager to show he wouldn't yield, Obama said he would "undoubtedly" still bring up human rights and due process concerns "if and when" the two do meet. The bizarre rift with the leader of a U.S. treaty ally was the most glaring example of how Obama has frequently found himself bound to foreign countries and leaders whose ties to the U.S. are critical even if their values sharply diverge. In Hangzhou this week, Obama's first stop in Asia, he heaped praise on Chinese President Xi Jinping for hosting the Group of 20 economic summit in his country, an authoritarian state long accused of human rights violations. His next stop was another one-party communist country with a dismal rights record: Laos, where mysterious disappearances have fueled concerns about a government crackdown. And sitting down with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Obama made no mention in public of the roughly 35,000 people Erdogan's government detained following the summer's failed coup in Turkey. Instead, he worked to reassure the NATO ally the U.S. would help bring to justice whoever was responsible for plotting the coup. Obama also spent about 90 minutes Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, another leader whose fate seems intertwined with Obama's in all the wrong ways. On opposing sides of many global issues, the U.S. and Russia are nonetheless trying to broker a deal to address the Syrian civil war and perhaps even partner militarily there. "President Putin's less colorful," Obama said, comparing him with Duterte. "But typically the tone of our meetings is candid, blunt, businesslike." Managing Duterte has become a worsening headache for Obama since the Filipino took office on June 30, pledging his foreign policy wouldn't be constricted by reliance on the U.S. Washington has tried largely to look the other way as Duterte has pursued closer relations with China, a marked shift for the Philippines considering recent tensions over Beijing's aspirations in the South China Sea. A public break from the Philippines would put Obama in a tough position, given the Southeast Asian nation's status as a longtime U.S. ally. The Obama administration has sought to compartmentalize by arguing that military and other cooperation won't be jeopardized even if it detests the current Philippine leader's tone. Last month, Duterte said he didn't mind Secretary of State John Kerry but "had a feud with his gay ambassador — son of a bitch, I'm annoyed with that guy." He applied the same moniker to an Australian missionary who was gang-raped and killed, and even to Pope Francis, even though the Philippines is a heavily Catholic nation. He later apologized. With a reputation as a tough-on-crime former mayor, Duterte has alarmed human rights groups with his deadly campaign against drugs, which Duterte has described as a harsh war. He has said the battle doesn't amount to genocide but has vowed to go to jail if needed to defend police and military members carrying out his orders.
President of Gambia Leaves For Exile, Allowing For First Peaceful Transfer Of Power  [SEP]  After weeks of uncertainty and political tension, the longtime ruler of Gambia, Yahya Jammeh, has boarded a plane to fly into exile. On Dec. 1, Jammeh lost an election to Adama Barrow in a shocking upset. Initially, Jammeh accepted the result — then, a week later, he changed his mind. He issued a state of emergency, and later Parliament extended his term in hopes of easing tensions. Troops from regional powers gathered at the border, prepared to take military action if Jammeh did not step down, and international pressure against him mounted. As NPR has reported, Jammeh has a dismal human rights record, and is seen as a leader who does not tolerate dissent. Prior to the election, which he assumed he would win, he said "only divine intervention" would remove him from office. After the election commissioner declared victory for Barrow last month, Jammeh ordered that troops seize the commission's headquarters. As the political stalemate dragged on in recent weeks, Gambia prepared for a showdown, and foreign intervention. Gambians poured across the border into Senegal fearing unrest and violence — including the president-elect, Adama Barrow. Barrow, a businessman, was sworn in while still in Dakar, Senegal, where he remains while security troops complete a final sweep. Jammeh's exile clears the way for Gambia's first peaceful and democratic transfer of power since the nation gained independence in 1965. Jammeh became the leader of the West African nation 22 years ago after staging a coup, and had vowed he would rule for "a billion years."
The Latest: Merkel welcomes center-left's OK for coalition  [SEP]  The Latest on Germany's politics (all times local): Angela Merkel has welcomed the decision by members of Germany's Social Democratic Party to support a coalition government with the long-time chancellor. Her party quoted Merkel on Twitter Sunday, saying "I congratulate the SPD on this clear result and look forward to continuing to work together for the good of our country." The general-secretary of Merkel's party and her possible future successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, said in statement Sunday that "the new government has a lot of work ahead of it that needs to be started soon." The Social Democrats' membership ballot backed a coalition deal with Merkel's Union bloc by a two-thirds majority. Merkel had to rely on her center-left rivals' support after failing to clinch a coalition agreement with two smaller parties last year. Parliament is expected to elect her to a fourth term as chancellor next week. Members of Germany's Social Democratic Party have voted in favor of joining a coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative bloc. The decision clears the last major hurdle to the formation of a new government and a fourth term for Merkel. Sunday's announcement by the party's leadership ends almost six months of uncertainty in German politics, the longest the country has been without a government in its post-war history. The center-left Social Democrats had furiously debated whether to extend the so-called grand coalition for another four years after suffering a slump in last year's election. In the end, two-thirds of the party's 464,000 members approved a coalition deal. Parliament is expected to meet next week to elect Merkel as chancellor, confirming her position as one of Europe's dominant politicians.
‘Serious measures’ taken as Taliban attack Farah city in western Afghanistan  [SEP]  KABUL, Afghanistan — Heavy fighting was ongoing in western Farah province near the Iranian border Tuesday morning after Taliban fighters launched a predawn assault on Farah city, killing and wounding several Afghan troops. The battle was underway in several areas of the city, Abdul Shakoor, a resident of the Bagh-e-Pul area, told Stars and Stripes on Tuesday morning. The Taliban had captured a police district on the city’s edge, he said. “We are stuck at our homes, we cannot go out, and everyone is in great fear,” he said. “I can see the Taliban from my house. They are roaming in the intersections.” Located along one of the country’s most lucrative drug routes, between Helmand province in the south and Iran to the west, the province has been embattled for months. Officials have warned of a deteriorating security situation as insurgents have entered the capital several times. A resurgent Taliban, largely dependent on narcotics revenues, has expanded its territorial control over parts of Afghanistan since the withdrawal of most international combat forces at the end of 2014. They briefly captured and held the capital of northern Kunduz province in late 2015. The attack on Farah is the first siege of a provincial capital this year. The insurgents failed to capture a single capital last year — a fact frequently touted by U.S. and NATO officials. In recent months, the U.S. has deployed additional advisers and carried out thousands of airstrikes in a bid to bolster the security situation in a strategy of renewed aggression. The Afghan Defense Ministry said in a statement that “serious measures” had been taken to defend Farah after the militants launched their offensive from the city’s north side. Security forces were sent to the city and deployed in various areas, the ministry said. At least eight insurgents had been killed and three wounded, it said. “We assure the people of Farah that all the operations implemented, air force, commandos and all other units stationed in the western part of the country are taking action,” the Defense Ministry said. The Taliban was asking the city’s residents to stay in their homes and promising they wouldn’t be harmed. Qari Yousaf Ahmadi, a Taliban spokesman, has said that their fighters started the attacks on the capital city about 2 a.m. and had captured an intelligence office, a police station and other checkpoints. He said their targets are only the military facilities. The Taliban have frequently claimed they try to avoid civilian casualties, but human rights organizations have counted thousands of civilian deaths caused by insurgent violence in recent years — many the result of Taliban attacks in populated urban areas. The United States’ renewed campaign against the Taliban has so far failed to curb the group’s advance, which has occurred largely in rural areas, and the militants maintain strongholds throughout the south. Despite the pressure of greatly stepped-up U.S. and Afghan airstrikes, the Taliban have shown little interest in the Afghan government’s offer of a comprehensive peace agreement. In January, NATO’s Resolute Support Mission, tasked with building up the Afghan government’s security forces, assessed that nearly 15 percent of the country’s 407 districts — more than 20 percent of the landmass — was under insurgent control or influence, according to a watchdog report released this month. It was the most since the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction began tracking district control data in late 2015, the report said. Since the launch of the Taliban’s spring offensive last month, the group has carried out several attacks in the capital, Kabul, and battled security forces in several provinces, taking additional districts in recent weeks. An attack in Farah province late last week reportedly left more than two dozen security forces dead. Early Tuesday, Ahmad Zaki, a doctor at the city’s central hospital, said that so far two dead police officers and 16 wounded security forces members had been brought to the medical facility since the start of the latest assault. Five wounded civilians were also being treated.
Vernon Philander: South Africa's next big all-rounder?  [SEP]  Philander has been gradually transforming into an all-rounder in Tests. Over the last 25 years, South Africa have established themselves as one of the powerhouses in world cricket. In addition to producing many brilliant batsmen and bowlers, some of the sport’s finest all-rounders have come out of South Africa that include the likes of Jacques Kallis, Shaun Pollock, and Lance Klusener. Around 10 days back, South African skipper Faf Du Plessis stated that fast bowler Vernon Philander has what it takes to fill Jacques Kallis’ shoes. The 32-year old put in a sensational performance in the second Test of the Basil D’Oliveira Trophy at Trent Bridge by scoring 54 and 42 in the first and second innings respectively, coming to bat at no.7 in both innings. With the ball, Philander took 2/48 in the first innings followed by 3/24 in the second innings as England were bowled out for 133, handing South Africa the win which has levelled the series at 1-1. Philander was adjudged the Man of the Match for his superb all-round effort. In the series-deciding Test at the Oval, Philander has so far taken 2/46 from 17 overs with England being dismissed for 353. Philander had an impressive debut for South Africa against Ireland at Belfast in 2007 and bowled a spell of 4/12. A few months later, he bowled an economical spell of 2/15 in 8 overs against Zimbabwe at Bulawayo. As a result, he was selected in South Africa’s squad to play the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 which his country would be hosting. Philander, 22, picked up two wickets each in both group games against West Indies and Bangladesh. However, he did not take any wickets during the Super 8s and the hosts were out by virtue of a lower net run-rate. Following the World T20, Philander did not take any wickets for the next few matches and was consequently dropped from both the ODI and T20 teams after South Africa’s Tour of England in 2008. Sensational Test debut and becoming one of South Africa’s key players in the format Three years later in 2011, Philander was chosen in South Africa’s Test squad for their home series against Australia and he made his Test debut in the first Test at Cape Town where he took 3/63 in the first innings with Phil Hughes being his first Test scalp. In the second innings, Philander bowled a fabulous spell of 5/15 as Australia were skittled for only 47, their lowest Test score in 109 years and their fourth lowest Test score overall. South Africa won the match and Philander was adjudged the Man of the Match. In the second Test at Johannesburg, Philander took another 5-wicket haul and was eventually adjudged the Player of the Series. Ever since, Philander has become a regular in the Test side and also came back to the ODI team, playing the 2015 World Cup where he picked up four wickets at an average of 34. Philander has been a regular in the Test team since his debut and over the past 6 years, has delivered a number of stellar performances for South Africa with the ball that include his match spells of 10/102 against Sri Lanka at Centurion and 10/114 against New Zealand at Hamilton which comprised his best bowling figures of 6/44 in Test Match cricket. Philander is currently South Africa’s 7th highest wicket-taker in Tests with 171 wickets at an average of 22.14. The 32-year old has also played a few crucial innings with the bat while coming down to bat at no.8 or no.9, scoring 1176 runs at quite a decent average of 26.13, hitting seven fifties. Philander has proven to be a very useful lower order batsman for South Africa who can play according to the situation and can chip in with vital runs when the team needs it. Hence, it isn’t much of a surprise that Du Plessis has opined Philander of becoming the new Jacques Kallis. Although, given Philander’s age of 32, he does not have too many years of cricket left in him but having gradually improved as a batsman (somewhat similar to Ravichandran Ashwin’s development as a batsman), we can all expect him to be the all-rounder South Africa need and deliver for the Proteas as much as he can. Extra cover: Satire: 5 possible newspaper headlines if Kevin Pietersen plays for South Africa in 2019 As far as becoming the next Jacques Kallis is concerned, he already has a lot more Test wickets (171) than Kallis had in his first six years (105). So, Big Vern can surpass him in the bowling department and if his body can be up to the task, he might even surpass the likes of Shaun Pollock, Dale Steyn, Allan Donald, and Makhaya Ntini to be the leading wicket-taker for South Africa in Tests. To sum it all up, Vernon Philander has already taken his first steps in becoming an all-rounder and provided he keeps up his form, he could well become one of South Africa’s greatest all-rounders in the upcoming years.
Starfield is the next single-player game from The Elder Scrolls team  [SEP]  Bethesda had a lot to say at its media briefing before the Electronic Entertainment Expo trade show in Los Angeles today. The company detailed Fallout 76, showed off Rage 2, and it teased … a lot — including Starfield, which is the first new Bethesda Game Studios property in 25 years. In a brief aside in a lengthy presentation at the end of the Bethesda event, Bethesda Game Studios boss Todd Howard explained that Starfield is a next-gen single-player adventure. He didn’t share many more details beyond that, but he did show a teaser trailer. “Starfield is a game we have spent years thinking about and working on,” said Howard. “Something we feel uniquely positioned to deliver.” And that’s it. Based on the name and the video, it seems clear that this is a science-fiction game set in space. But we’ll probably have to wait until next E3 to find out exactly how it will work. At least we’ll have Fallout 76 until then.
Dozens killed in two separate attacks in Pakistan on eve of Eid  [SEP]  Dozens killed in two separate attacks in Pakistan on eve of Eid Suicide car bomber kills 12 in Quetta and twin blasts in Parachinar leave at least 25 dead At least 37 people have been killed and more than 100 injured in two separate attacks in Pakistan, according to local officials. Early on Friday, a suicide car bomber killed 12 people in Quetta in the volatile south-west.
Nationals jettison Kelley after his outburst on mound  [SEP]  WASHINGTON (AP) - Shawn Kelley's outburst on the mound got him booted from the Washington Nationals. The Nationals designated Kelley for assignment on Tuesday, a day after he threw his glove to the ground and glared into the dugout while working the ninth inning of a 25-4 blowout of the New York Mets. Manager Dave Martinez and general manager Mike Rizzo say Kelley's actions were disrespectful and unprofessional. The 34-year-old Kelley signed as a free agent with Washington in December 2015 and appeared in 135 games with the team. He had a 3.34 ERA in 35 appearances this season. He has pitched in 424 games, all in relief, over 10 seasons with four teams, and has a 3.73 career ERA. Washington recalled right-hander Jimmy Cordero from Triple-A Syracuse to take Kelley's place on the roster.
Six dead, including gunman, in shooting spree in Bakersfield, California, authorities say  [SEP]  LOS ANGELES — A man went on a shooting rampage in one of the major cities of California's agricultural heartland Wednesday evening, killing his wife and four others before turning the gun on himself, authorities said. While an exact motive for the killing spree was not disclosed, Lt. Mark King of the Kern County Sheriff's Office said "there's a strong indication" it was a case of domestic violence. None of the names of the victims or the deceased gunmen were released. Gunshots rang out shortly before 5:19 p.m. when dispatchers received multiple calls about a shooting in the 600 block of Manwell Boulevard, King said. Arriving deputies found three victims, but the gunman had fled. Fifteen minutes later, more calls came in about a shooter in the 9400 block of Breckenridge Road in Bakersfield, California, about 90 miles north of Los Angeles. There, two more victims were found — and again the suspect was gone. At 5:49 p.m., a woman said she was a carjacking victim and was able to provide a description of her vehicle. Five minutes later, a deputy saw the vehicle being driven by a man who fit the description of the suspect, King said. They pulled over the car in the 3300 block of Edison Highway. The suspect got out of the vehicle toting a large-caliber handgun but before he could be arrested, he turned the gun on himself and pulled the trigger. Among the dead were the suspect's wife and another woman, King said, adding that detectives were continuing to try to piece together the episode, including questioning some 30 witnesses. He also said that other than the wife, he was unaware of the relationship between the victims and the suspect.
Presidential election recount set to begin in Wisconsin  [SEP]  MADISON, Wis. | The first candidate-driven statewide recount of a presidential election in 16 years is set to begin Thursday in Wisconsin, a state that Donald Trump won by less than a percentage point over Hillary Clinton after polls long predicted a Clinton victory. The recount requested by Green Party candidate Jill Stein carries none of the drama of the Florida presidential recount of 2000, when the outcome of the election between Al Gore and George W. Bush hung in the balance. Almost no one expects Stein’s push for recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania to result in a Clinton victory over Trump. “This is certainly not Bush v. Gore,” said Wisconsin’s chief elections administrator Mike Haas. But still, county election officials across Wisconsin have hired temporary workers, expanded hours and dusted off recount manuals to prepare for the work of retabulating nearly 3 million ballots. Most counties will manually recount the ballots, although Stein lost a court challenge this week to force hand recounts everywhere. The state’s largest county, Milwaukee, was planning to recount the ballots by feeding them through the same machines that counted them on election night. In Dane County, where Clinton won 71 percent of the vote, the ballots will be counted by hand. Clinton lost to Trump by about 22,000 votes in Wisconsin. Wisconsin election officials have less than two weeks to complete the recount. Dec. 13 is the federal deadline to certify the vote to avoid having the fate of Wisconsin’s 10 electoral votes decided by Congress. Even if that were to happen, the votes would almost certainly go to Trump, since Republicans control both chambers of Congress. Stein has argued, without evidence, that irregularities in the votes in all three states suggest that there could have been tampering with the vote, perhaps through a well-coordinated, highly complex cyberattack. Her critics, including the Wisconsin Republican Party, contend that she’s a little-known candidate who is merely trying to raise her profile while raising millions of dollars. Stein had raised nearly $7 million, about twice as much as her longshot presidential campaign, to pay for the recounts. The Wisconsin recount was estimated to cost about $3.9 million, while Stein paid $973,250 for the one in Michigan. Stein filed a lawsuit Monday in Pennsylvania to force a recount there.

Kellyanne Conway on Hillary Clinton: ‘Whether she goes to jail is not up to Donald Trump’  [SEP]  Donald Trump raised eyebrows during Sunday’s presidential debate by saying Hillary Clinton would be “in jail” if he were president. But Trump’s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, says he was just kidding. “It was a quip,” Conway said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Monday. “Whether she goes to jail is not up to Donald Trump.” The purported “quip” came after the Republican nominee vowed to appoint a special prosecutor to go after Clinton. “I hate to say it, but if I win, I’m going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation,” Trump told his Democratic rival. “Because there have never been so many lies, so much deception.” Slideshow: Body language: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump face off for their second fiery debate >>> Trump said that Americans are “furious” that the FBI declined to recommend prosecution after investigating Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. FBI Director James Comey did declare, however, that there was evidence that Clinton and her top aides were careless with classified material on the server. “Everything [Trump] just said is absolutely false, but I’m not surprised,” Clinton said, inviting the audience to visit her campaign’s website to fact-check his statements. “It’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,” Clinton said. After the debate, the Clinton campaign said Trump’s comments showed he would not respect the wall that attorneys general have traditionally kept between whom they prosecute and the president’s politics. “That is the comment of a dictator that you expect to hear in a banana republic — the idea of jailing your political opponents,” Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon told Yahoo News. “So @realDonaldTrump will ORDER his AG to take certain actions,” Holder tweeted. “When Nixon tried that his AG [Elliot Richardson] courageously resigned. Trump is dangerous/unfit.” “Be afraid of any candidate who says he will order DOJ/FBI to act on his command This is dangerous/so is @realDonaldTrump-he’s not qualified,” Holder continued. “In the USA we do not threaten to jail political opponents. @realDonaldTrump said he would. He is promising to abuse the power of the office.” Conway herself raised eyebrows after the debate when she was asked by MSNBC’s Chris Matthews whether she would stay on as Trump’s campaign manager through the election. The day before, she had suddenly canceled her Sunday-morning TV appearances and was replaced by former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. NBC reported that she was thinking about leaving the campaign. “I’m with the campaign until the bitter end, unless,” she replied. “Who knows? But I’m sitting here as his campaign manager. I’m sitting here with you where he just performed beautifully.” Matthews asked if she was “worried about more shoes dropping.” “No, I didn’t say that,” Conway said. “I’ve made a commitment, and I believe that he would be a much better president. First of all, he won the debate tonight, clearly. And the reason you know he won the debate is A, you watched it, or B, everyone is going to talk about that he was standing behind her and in her space. I am committed to not letting Hillary Clinton appoint the next three or four justices to the Supreme Court.” Conway came back to clarify her vague reply. “The ‘unless’ is very simple: It’s unless someone in my household needs me or unless something changes in my own life.”
Hong Kong's ZZ Capital buys U.S. index provider Alerian  [SEP]  HONG KONG, July 14 (Reuters) - Hong Kong investment firm ZZ Capital International agreed on Friday to buy U.S. index provider Alerian in a deal valued at up to $812 million, gaining a foothold in the growing market for U.S. energy industry investment products. ZZ Capital, which is listed on the Growth Enterprise Market of the Hong Kong stock exchange, is making an initial payment of $582 million, with up to $230 million more if Alerian meets certain revenue targets for the years ending 2018-2021, the company said in a securities filing. ZZ Capital shares have fallen 26 percent since the start of the year, giving it a market capitalisation of $218.3 million. The company plans to raise $286 million with the issue of new shares in a rights offering to make the initial payment, with an undisclosed amount also from debt financing and from internal cash. It also plans to raise another $230 million with a second rights offering to meet its future commitments based on Alerian's performance. The Listing Committee of the Hong Kong exchange viewed the deal as "an extreme very substantial acquisition" and requested additional information similar to that required of companies going public, ZZ Capital said in the filing. ZZ Capital HAS hired Haitong International Capital as financial adviser to conduct due diligence of Alerian. Dallas-based Alerian is controlled by billionaire brothers Gabriel and Daniel Hammond, who will earn $485 million in cash for their combined 85 percent stake. Alerian's Chief Executive Kenny Feng, who owns the remainder 15 percent of the company, will earn $21 million in cash and $64 million in units of the special purpose vehicle ZZ Capital set up to buy Alerian. The company has built a niche in the energy industry by providing an index that tracks so-called master limited partnerships (MLPs), which build the pipelines and storage tanks and are a common corporate structure in the oil and gas infrastructure sector. There are about $17 billion of assets linked to Alerian indices, including the Alerian MLP index. Alerian posted $58.6 million in profit in 2016, down 4.3 percent from 2015, ZZ Capital said.

Minna Jail Break: I have not condemned any criminal, says Gov. Bello  [SEP]  Minna – Gov. Abubakar Bello of Niger on Monday refuted allegations that the Sunday night attack by some gunmen on Minna Medium Prison was as a result of activities of some condemned criminals. One prison officer and a motorcyclist lost their lives when unknown gunmen attacked the prison and freed 210 prisoners. Bello also refuted claims that the attackers were suspected members of the Boko Haram or armed robbers who came to free some of their members in the prison. He explained that since assumption of office in 2015, he has yet to see any paper on condemned criminals. “I have not seen anything so far on condemn criminals or anybody that was condemned. Only when I see anything on condemned criminals that is when I will do something on it. “Sometimes, people get desperate and do crazy things. Nobody is sure why the attack was carried out, saying the attackers were members of the Boko Haram is mere rumour,” he said. Bello, who described the incident as unfortunate, said that the state would work with the Federal government to address the challenges of infrastructures and shortage of manpower in the prison. The governor appealed to the prison officers to discharge their duties diligently as investigation was ongoing to know the reason behind the attack. “At the state level here, we will look at the issue of infrastructure, operations and shortage of manpower. But, again, people should take their jobs seriously. “Even though investigation is ongoing, we need to do more in terms of taking care of our facilities especially prison.” Also, Mr Ahmed Ja’afaru, Comptroller General of the Nigeria Prison Service, said that there was no suspected Boko Haram members in the prison. He said that investigation would reveal the reason behind the attack and how the attackers gained access to the prison. “Our men and facility were attacked. Investigation will tell us the number of the attackers and how they were able to gain access,” he said. Meanwhile, Malam Mohammed Umaru, an eye witness told NAN that the gunmen came with four vehicles. He said that the gunmen divided themselves into groups and directed residents of the area to go into their houses before attacking the prison. “They told us to enter our houses that they don’t want to see anyone outside. We had to start calling our loved ones that were in town not to return home yet until after the attackers had gone. “They killed a prison officer who was resuming night duty and an ‘Okada man’ that brought him,” he said.

After attack on Chinese consulate, Pakistan points to India  [SEP]  Counter-terrorism officer Umar Khitab said Saturday that authorities are investigating whether Baluch separatist commander Aslam Achhu, who they believe masterminded the attack, is in India. The Baluch Liberation Army claimed the attack, and Khitab said the group is backed by "the 'enemy country," a reference to India.
At least 18 dead, 20 wounded after twin car bomb attacks in Somalia  [SEP]  Two car bomb blasts in Somalia's capital killed at least 18 people on Friday and shattered a months-long period of calm in Mogadishu, which is often the target of attacks by the al-Shabab extremist group. Relatives and medical staff transport a wounded civilian on a stretcher at Medina hospital, following a twin car bomb attack in the capital Mogadishu. The explosions came a day after Somalia's interior minister warned of an explosives-laden vehicle somewhere in the capital. The first blast occurred near the country's intelligence headquarters, police Capt. Mohamed Hussein told The Associated Press. He said the second occurred near parliament's headquarters, where the vehicle had tried to speed through a checkpoint before security forces engaged with the gunmen suspected of trying to attack the presidential palace. The Aamin Ambulance service ferried 18 bodies and another 20 injured people after the blasts, director Abdirahman Abdulqadir told the AP. The Somalia-based al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack via its radio arm, Andalus. Concerns have been high over plans to hand over the country's security to Somalia's own forces as a 21,000-strong African Union force begins a withdrawal that is expected to be complete in 2020. On Thursday the head of the AU force, Francisco Madeira, said ending the pullout before 2021 "could bring about a serious risk of reversals that could derail the gains already made." Somali forces, he said, are not yet ready.
Summit peak: Mt. Paektu final stop of North-South meeting  [SEP]  An active volcano, Mount Paektu is the tallest peak on the Korean peninsula and often considered the spiritual home of the Korean nation. For all Koreans, it is the mythical birthplace of Dangun, the legendary founder of the first Korean kingdom more than 4,000 years ago. The 2,744-metre (9,003-foot) peak is referenced in the first verse of the South Korean national anthem, and "Let's go to Mount Paektu" is a popular North Korean pop song calling for loyalty to Kim Jong Un. Kim and Moon Jae-in went to the peak together on Thursday, in the last act of the South Korean president's three-day visit to the North. "Mount Paektu is the spiritual mountain for the Korean people and it's the most symbolic mountain," Moon's spokesman told reporters. For North Koreans, it is also where Kim Il Sung, the country's founder and Kim's grandfather, set up a secret military camp for anti-Japanese guerrilla missions during the 1910-45 colonial rule. North Korea claims his son and successor Kim Jong Il was born there, although historians say he was actually born at a Soviet military base in Siberia where the older Kim was in exile. Regardless, Pyongyang refers to the ruling Kim family as the "Paektu bloodline" and the peak is a favoured backdrop for the propaganda murals of the elder Kims, either singly or together, that are ubiquitous in the North. The current North Korean leader makes frequent visits to the mountain. He hiked to the top of the peak in December -- his last known trip -- before the New Year speech in which he kickstarted his diplomatic overtures. Despite its revered status on both sides of the border, South Koreans can only visit the mountain through China. Known as Changbai in Chinese, the border between China and North Korea runs across the peak's beautiful crater lake. The 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty, leaving the two Koreas still technically still engaged in a war that placed an impenetrable border and banned all civilian exchanges between them. They agreed in 2007 to open tours to the peak for South Koreans and to run direct flights between it and Seoul, but the plan was never put into effect. Seoul suspended South Korean tours to Mount Kumgang -- another scenic mountain in the North -- in 2008 after a tourist was shot dead by a North Korean soldier. Moon's office quoted him as saying on board his aircraft when he arrived in Pyongyang: "I had vowed that I'd visit Mount Paektu, but from the North rather than from China."

Gambia’s leader calls for peace  [SEP]  Banjul. Gambian President Yahya Jammeh said Tuesday that no protests would be permitted after a two-week electoral campaign, as rallies in favour of opposition leader Adama Barrow reached boiling point in the capital, Banjul. A day of opposition protests ahead of a presidential election in two days’ time highlighted deep divisions over Jammeh’s 22-year-rule, while the president took the opportunity to say his opponents could not succeed. Barrow, a businessman, emerged from obscurity to become the flagbearer of all The Gambia’s opposition parties bar one after mass arrests of supporters from the largest anti-government grouping in April. “People have shown us tremendous support. With that support we are 100 percent plus that we are going to win and with a big margin,” he told AFP on the final day of the campaign. With no official opinion polls, it is difficult to corroborate Barrow’s claim, but diplomatic sources have indicated in recent days that Jammeh faces his most significant challenge since taking power in a 1994 coup. “If Jammeh wants advice if he loses, let him accept the will of the people and accept the value of the Gambian people,” Barrow said. Rights bodies and media watchdogs including Reporters Without Borders (RSF) accuse Jammeh of cultivating a “pervasive climate of fear” and of crushing dissent against his regime, one cause of the mass exodus of Gambian youths to Europe. At a rally near the capital Tuesday, people shouted “Step down!” as they waved red cards demanding Jammeh’s removal after 22 years in power. “He killed dozens of our brothers, he’s a killer,” one man shouted.

FIFA Bans Lionel Messi For 4 World Cup Qualifying Games For Verbally Abusing Referee  [SEP]  ZURICH (CBSNewYork/AP) — Lionel Messi has been banned from Argentina’s next four World Cup qualifiers, starting with Tuesday’s game in Bolivia. Messi was banned for “having directed insulting words at an assistant referee” during a home qualifier against Chile on Thursday, FIFA said hours before kickoff in La Paz. “This decision is in line with the FIFA Disciplinary Committee’s previous rulings in similar cases,” the world soccer body said. Messi and the Argentine soccer federation can appeal against the ban to FIFA. Messi was also fined 10,000 Swiss francs ($10,160). FIFA intervened when the incident was not initially reported by the Brazilian referee after Argentina’s 1-0 win at Monumental Stadium in Buenos Aires. It was judged a red-card offense for Messi, who scored the only goal from a first-half penalty. Television pictures showed Messi reacting angrily late in the game when the assistant flagged him for a foul. He waved his arms and shouted profane insults at the Brazilian official. After the game, Messi refused to shake hands with the assistant who had annoyed him. According to Argentinian newspaper Ole, which published documents from FIFA’s inquiry, head match referee Sandro Ricci said he was unaware of the incident. “I did not hear any offensive language from Messi or anyone else towards myself, besides the normal players’ complaints … during the match,” he said. “If I had heard any offensive word, I would have acted in accordance with the rules of the game.” Messi will also miss Argentina’s game at Uruguay on Aug. 31, and home games against Venezuela on Sept. 5 and Peru on Oct. 5. Argentina is third in the South American standings with five games left. Four teams qualify directly to play in Russia. The 2014 World Cup finalists have struggled without their star player in qualifying for 2018, earning only seven out of a possible 21 points when he did not play.
Housing fire in eastern China kills 22, injures three - Xinhua  [SEP]  BEIJING (Reuters) - At least 22 people were killed when a two-storey residential building in China's eastern Jiangsu province caught fire on Sunday, the official Xinhua news agency cited local authorities as saying. The fire broke out before dawn at the building in the town of Yushan in Changshu city, Xinhua said. The blaze has since been put out, and local police said they had arrested a suspect for alleged arson. An investigation into the cause was under way and disaster-relief teams have been set up to offer legal and mental support for the families and relatives of the victims, Xinhua said.

South Korean named Interpol president in blow to Russia  [SEP]  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington encourages all nations and organizations that are part of Interpol to choose a leader with credibility and integrity that reflects one of the world's most critical law enforcement bodies. "We believe Mr. Kim will be just that," he said.
Focus on North Korea as the Winter Paralympics starts  [SEP]  A now typically glamorous ceremony featuring spectacular lighting and fireworks took place as the world's takes in the news that United States President Donald Trump has agreed to meet the leader of the North, Kim Jong-un. A record 567 athletes from 48 countries will battle for 80 Paralympic medals in six different sports: alpine skiing, snowboarding, para-ice hockey, wheelchair curling and the nordic skiing disciplines of cross-country and biathlon. North Korea are making a winter paras debut, with two athletes in cross country skiing but, unlike at the Winter Olympics, where North and South Korean athletes marched at the opening ceremony under a unified flag, the two nations were separate for today’s showpiece. The thawing, meanwhile, in American and North Korean relations is quite a turnaround from last year, when Pyongyang tested missiles that could reach the US mainland and detonated what it said was an H-bomb, sparking fury from Trump who threatened to "completely destroy" Kim's nation.
âNo discussion of security arrangementsâ after ex-spy discharged from hospital  [SEP]  Scotland Yard has said it will not discuss “any protective or security arrangements” for former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter following their discharge from a UK hospital. Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, 33, were admitted to Salisbury District Hospital after coming into contact with the military-grade nerve agent novichok. The pair were left fighting for their lives after being found unconscious on a park bench in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on March 4. On Friday morning, the hospital confirmed that Mr Skripal had left the hospital, following his daughter’s discharge on April 10. In a statement, Scotland Yard said: “Detectives from the UK’s Counter Terrorism Policing network continue to investigate the attempted murders of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury in March this year. “They are both making good progress and we are pleased that Mr Skripal has now also been released from hospital, which was announced by the NHS earlier this morning. “This is a complex investigation and detectives continue to gather and piece together all the evidence to establish the full facts and circumstances behind this dreadful attack. “In the interests of Sergei and Yulia’s safety, we will not be discussing any protective or security arrangements that are in place.” Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey, of Wiltshire Police, was also admitted to Salisbury District Hospital after being exposed to the nerve agent and went home on March 22. A hospital spokesman said: “While these patients have now been discharged, their right to patient confidentiality remains and limits us from giving detailed accounts of the treatment these individuals received. “However, treating people who are so acutely unwell, having been poisoned by nerve agents, requires stabilising them, keeping them alive until their bodies could produce more enzymes to replace those that had been poisoned.” A small amount of novichok is thought to have been used in liquid form to target former Russian agent Mr Skripal and his daughter. The attack in March sparked a wave of diplomatic expulsions by Britain and its allies, and retaliatory ones by Russia. Moscow has repeatedly denied responsibility for the attack. “That he, Yulia and DS Bailey have been able to leave us so soon after coming into contact with this nerve agent is thanks to the hard work, skill and professionalism of our clinicians, who provide outstanding care to all our patients, day in and day out,” she said. “This has been a difficult time for those caught up in this incident – the patients, our staff and the people of Salisbury. “I want to thank the public for their support, and I want to pay a special tribute to both the clinical staff here at the trust and those who work so hard behind the scenes. “They’ve demonstrated the very best of the NHS.” Lorna Wilkinson, director of nursing at the hospital, said Mr Skripal’s discharge was “an important stage in his recovery”. “Treating him and the other two people poisoned by this nerve agent, while still providing outstanding care to the other patients who rely on our hospital, has been a huge and unprecedented challenge that I’m proud our staff at Salisbury Hospital have risen to,” she said. Professor Steve Powis, medical director of NHS England, said: “I would like to thank the nurses, doctors, and all the other staff whose skills, compassion and dedication have saved the lives of Yulia and Sergei Skripal and Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey.” Prof Powis described their “remarkable recovery” as a reminder of the “world-class treatment and care” available at local hospitals around the country.
Prosecutors want 13 women to testify against Bill Cosby; trial date set for June  [SEP]  Prosecutors hoping to paint actor Bill Cosby as a serial predator at his upcoming sexual assault trial sought Tuesday to put on testimony from 13 other women who say Cosby gave them quaaludes, other drugs or alcohol before molesting them. The criminal case against the 79-year-old entertainer involves a single 2004 encounter at his home near Philadelphia with former Temple University employee Andrea Constand. The presiding judge at a hearing Tuesday vowed to start the trial by June 5. However, Montgomery County Judge Steven O'Neill did not immediately rule on any of the pretrial disputes over evidence, including the prosecution effort to call other women as witnesses. Under Pennsylvania law, they could be allowed to testify to show an alleged pattern of behavior, even if no charges were ever filed. Prosecutors said they reviewed accusations made by 50 Cosby accusers and concluded that 13 said they were also drugged or intoxicated and then molested by Cosby. One woman said she declined his offer of quaaludes but accepted Champagne that she believed was spiked. She later woke up naked in a hotel room and said she had been sexually assaulted. Another said she took quaaludes from him, while a third said she believed her drink was spiked with the powerful, now-banned sedative. The defense is expected to oppose any testimony from other accusers. The defense will also ask to have the trial moved to another county, given that the decision over whether Cosby should be arrested became a flashpoint in last fall's election for district attorney. Cosby was arrested on Dec. 30, as incoming prosecutor Kevin Steele eyed the approaching 12-year deadline to file felony charges. Constand told police that Cosby gave her three unmarked pills and then molested her as she drifted in and out of consciousness. Cosby's lawyers meanwhile asked the judge Tuesday to suppress a 2005 telephone conversation recorded by Constand's mother in Toronto. Cosby had called her from California. The defense said the call violated Pennsylvania's two-party consent law on wiretaps. But prosecutors who played the tape in court argued that Cosby said he heard beeps on the call and asked if he was being taped. Gianna Constand denied it. Cosby in the conversation described the sex act as "digital penetration" but refused to say what pills he had given her daughter. In his deposition, he later said he feared sounding like "a dirty old man" on the call. Steele will fight to use both the phone call and Cosby's potentially damaging deposition from Constand's sexual battery lawsuit. Cosby settled the suit after four days of questioning. He acknowledged having a sexual encounter with Constand, but said it was consensual. He also admitted to a string of extramarital affairs and sexual "rendezvous," some with women in their late teens and early 20s. Cosby was arrested in December after the investigation into the allegation Constand first brought in 2005 was reopened, following disclosure of the entertainer's deposition and a stream of new allegations by women going back decades. Cosby looked noticeably healthier Tuesday than he has at earlier hearings, although his lawyers told the judge that he is blind. O'Neill offered whatever accommodations he might need at trial, but the defense didn't immediately ask for any. Cosby clutched an aide's arm as he walked, but his eyes appeared less milky and he seemed more engaged and animated as he spoke with his legal team. As O'Neill pushed for a trial date, lead defense lawyer Brian McMonagle of Philadelphia said he has other trials booked until June. Cosby has replaced one top-tier Los Angeles law firm with another on his defense team, the second such switch in about a year. Cosby has so far lost his efforts to have the charges thrown out. Cosby became known as "America's Dad" for his top-rated show on family life that ran from 1984 to 1992. He had been in the limelight since the early 1960s, when the Philadelphian was tapped to star in "I Spy," becoming the rare black actor to star in a network TV show at the time. The women who accuse him of sexual misconduct for nearly that long say the charges were a long time coming. Cosby's defenders instead suggest he is a wealthy target for the many women he met during five decades as an A-list celebrity. Defense lawyer Angela Agrusa told reporters after the hearing that the accusers have been "paraded" before the press by lawyer Gloria Allred and others, without their accounts of abuse being investigated. "We have seen a barrage of new accusers claiming, 'Me too,'" Agrusa said. Cosby spokesman Andrew Wyatt brought race into the equation, saying Allred and others have trampled on Cosby's civil rights. Many of the accusers, including Constand, are white. "Mr. Cosby is no stranger to discrimination and racial hatred, and throughout his career Mr. Cosby has always used his voice and his celebrity to highlight the commonalities and has portrayed the differences that are not negative — no matter the race, gender and religion of a person," he said in a statement.
Anger erupts on Yemen's Socotra as UAE deploys over 100 troops  [SEP]  Angry protests have erupted on the Yemeni island of Socotra after the United Arab Emirates deployed four military aircraft and more than 100 troops to the famed UNESCO World Heritage Site. Residents told Al Jazeera that the four Emirati aircraft arrived illegally on the island on Wednesday in an attempt to intimidate officials from the internationally recognised government who were making a rare visit to the archipelago. Hundreds of Yemenis had come out to welcome Ahmed bin Daghr, Yemeni prime minister, and 10 of his ministers and to denounced the UAE's presence on the island. Videos posted on social media showed protesters chanting slogans in support of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi and a unified Yemen. Residents told Al Jazeera that the crowds were angry after reports emerged that Emirati forces had expelled Yemeni soldiers assigned to protect the main island's airport. سقطرى تهتف لليمن بحضور ابن دغر. شعب نبيل،يعاني ويهتف لوطنه. بالله عليكم مثل هذا الجمهور ألا يستحق أن تكونوا معه؟ إنه يبحث عنكم. عودوا إليه. pic.twitter.com/VqUzzW6pcL — Dr Mohammed Jumeh (@MJumeh) May 2, 2018 Located due east of the Horn of Africa in the Arabian Sea, the island of 60,000 people, which is known for its unique flora and fauna, has been administered by Yemen for much of the last two centuries. But since the UAE entered Yemen's war in March 2015 as part of a Saudi-led coalition seeking to remove Houthi rebels, Abu Dhabi has exploited the security vacuum and tried to gain a foothold in the strategically placed island. The UAE has confirmed carrying out military operations on Socotra, with local media reporting that the UAE had leased Socotra and the nearby Abd al-Kuri island for 99 years. The flag of the UAE and images of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan adorn official buildings and busy thoroughfares. According to Human Rights Watch, Abu Dhabi has financed and trained a network of militias that only answer to it, set up prisons, and created a security establishment parallel to Hadi's government. Earlier this year, Yemen's tourism ministry warned that the UAE had tried to convince islanders "to vote on a referendum of self-determination", calling it a "dangerous step." Andreas Krieg, an academic at King's College London, said the latest developments in Socotra were part of a much larger strategy to consolidate power in southern Yemen. "The UAE see themselves, or want to see themselves in the future, as the link between the east and the west. "It's very important for them to control trade links which mostly go through the suez canal and the Bab al-Mandeb Strait between Yemen and the Horn of Africa. "What they've done is found an island that is very strategically located, acts as a quasi-aircraft carrier in the middle of the Indian ocean and where they can control traffic while giving favourable access to countries that are related to them."
Brazilian football team’s plane crashes in Colombia killing 76 | The Financial Gazette  [SEP]  SEVENTY-six people have been killed after a plane carrying members of a Brazilian football team crashed in Colombia, police have said. Six others survived, including three players. The charter aircraft, carrying 72 passengers and nine crew, came down in a mountainous area as it approached Colombia’s second-largest city, Medellin. Photographs from the scene near the small town of La Union showed dozens of bodies laid out and covered with sheets. The plane, which departed from Santa Cruz in Bolivia, had been carrying the Chapecoense football team, based in Chapeco in southern Brazil. Colombian authorities named the three footballers who survived as Alan Ruschel, Jakson Follmann, and Neto. Another player, Danilo, had initially survived too, but later died. The other two people who survived were passengers Rafael Correa Gobbato and Ximena Suarez. Concerning the condition of 27-year-old defender Ruschel, a doctor said: “We still don’t have a final diagnosis. “We are waiting for lab results and X-rays to make a decision and do a (surgical) procedure.” It was reported in Brazil that 21 journalists had been on board the plane. In a statement on its Facebook page, the club said: “May God accompany our athletes, officials, journalists and other guests travelling with our delegation.” Club vice president Ivan Tozzo told cable channel SporTV: “We are very sad, gathered here in the locker room of our stadium. “There are a lot of people crying in our city. We could never imagine this. “Chapecoense is the biggest reason for joy here.” A Chapecoense player who has been sidelined through injury and was not on the flight, Alejandro Martinuccio, said: “I feel profound sadness. “The only thing I can ask is prayers for the companions who were on the flight.” The side, which entered Brazil’s first division in 2014 for the first time since the 1970s, was preparing to play on Wednesday in the first of a two-leg Copa Sudamericana final against Medellin’s Atletico Nacional. Atletico Nacional has tweeted to express its sympathies. It is not yet clear what caused the aircraft – operated by charter airline LaMia – to come down, but Colombia has been experiencing heavy rain and thunderstorms. Authorities said it had declared an emergency and lost radar contact shortly before 10pm local time on Monday (0300 GMT) after an electrical failure. The head of Colombia’s civil aviation agency, Alfredo Bocanegra, said reported comments from a female flight attendant that the plane had run out of fuel were being evaluated. Radar shows the plane was circling before it came down at about 10.15pm (0315 GMT). Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch is sending three investigators to assist in the search for answers. The bad weather has made access to the crash site difficult, causing the rescue operation to be suspended in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Low visibility meant an air force helicopter had to turn back. Local fire department chief Edison Gutierrez said: “If it’s not four-wheel drive vehicles, you can’t get in.” According to local radio, the same plane had carried Argentina’s national squad to a match earlier this month in Brazil, and had also been used by the Venezuelan national team. The president of Brazil, Michel Temer, has declared three days of mourning. “I express my solidarity in this sad hour during which tragedy has beset dozens of Brazilian families,” he said. “The government will do all it can to alleviate the pain of the friends and family of sport and national journalism.” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a statement: “This is a very, very sad day for football. “At this difficult time our thoughts are with the victims, their families and friends.” Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea tweeted: “Deeply affected by Medellin’s plane crash. I shared locker with (Chapecoense player) Cleber Santana and it’s difficult to reveal how I feel. A huge hug.” Barcelona and Real Madrid each held a minute’s silence at their training sessions on Tuesday. The South American football federation has suspended all games following the news from Colombia. –news.sky.com Follow us on Twitter on @FingazLive and on Facebook – The Financial Gazette
Palestinian leader: Peace could suffer if US embassy moves  [SEP]  VATICAN CITY (AP) — Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has warned that peace could suffer if the incoming Trump administration goes ahead with plans to move the U.S. embassy to Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Abbas made the comments Saturday as he inaugurated the Palestinian embassy to the Holy See following an audience with Pope Francis. Speaking through an Italian translator, Abbas said he had only heard of the proposal to move the embassy to Jerusalem, and couldn't comment officially unless and until it happens. But he added: "If this is the decision, to transfer the embassy to Jerusalem, it will not help peace and we hope it doesn't happen."
Double-decker tourist bus slams into tree in Malta, 2 dead  [SEP]  VALLETTA, Malta (AP) — An open-top double-decker tourist bus slammed into a low-hanging tree branch in Malta on Monday, killing two people and injuring 50 others, including a dozen children. The accident happened in Zurrieq, a popular tourist destination just outside the capital that is famous for its ruins and "blue grotto." Police said the two passengers who died were a 37-year-old Spanish woman and a 62-year-old Belgian man. They and most of the people injured were sitting on the top deck when the bus hit the branch. Health Minister Chris Fearne said most of the passengers hailed from Belgium or Britain, though police said the seriously injured also included a German and an Italian. Twelve of the 50 people hurt were children, two of whom suffered critical injuries. The 24-year-old bus driver was not hurt. Hop-on, hop-off buses are common for sightseeing in major cities in the United States and Europe. In November 2015, 19 people were injured when a double-decker tour bus in San Francisco crashed into pedestrians, vehicles and construction scaffolding. San Francisco police concluded the driver of the open-top bus had been going too fast.
Israeli Soldier Who Killed A Wounded Palestinian Is Sentenced To 18 Months  [SEP]  More than a month after a military court found Sgt. Elor Azaria guilty of manslaughter, the soldier has been ordered to serve an 18-month prison sentence. Azaria, 21, who worked as an army medic, shot and killed Abdel Fattah al-Sharif, a Palestinian assailant who was already incapacitated. The soldier's defense team has said it plans to appeal any sentence that includes jail time. Since last month's verdict, many on Israel's right wing have called for Azaria to be pardoned — something that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he supports. A potential pardon would have to come from Israel's president. Video of the shooting, which took place in the occupied West Bank last March, sparked strong and disparate reactions in Israel and beyond, fueling debate over the proper use of force and rules of engagement. Here's how NPR's Joanna Kakissis described the videotaped events in her report from Jerusalem last month: "Al-Sharif had been shot and wounded after stabbing an Israeli soldier. Eleven minutes later, Azaria shot the motionless Al-Sharif in the head. "A human rights activist filmed the killing. The video went viral. "Many Israelis say Azaria was justified because he feared Al-Sharif might have been wearing an explosive belt. But Azaria's superior officers say his actions contradict the army's ethical standards." The crime of manslaughter could have exposed Azaria to a 20-year prison term; prosecutors had sought a sentence of 3-5 years. In addition to the prison sentence, the military court demoted Azaria to the rank of private.

Villanova's Phil Booth answers questions during a news conference for the championship game of the Final Four NCAA college basketball tournament, Sunday, April 1, 2018, in San Antonio. SAN ANTONIO (AP) - Villanova has made more 3-pointers than any team in NCAA Division I history and fittingly set a Final Four single-game record for made 3s to reach Monday's national championship game . It's made them a clear favorite to beat Michigan for their second national championship in three seasons. And sure, their ability to keep hitting from outside - even if it isn't at a record pace - against the Wolverines' tough defense will play a big role in reaching that goal. Yet there's more beyond the obvious glow from all those deep shots. They'll have to do a better job rebounding than they did in some of their few losses. And they'll have to keep the ball moving while racking up assists with a deep well of shooters on the ready, something they've done nearly all year. "It's very good - we've been very unselfish this year," redshirt junior guard Phil Booth said Sunday. "We know, always look for the best shot. Not taking too many 3s is what we've been doing a good job of. ... And when we get a lot of assists, good things happen." Villanova (35-4) is atop KenPom's adjusted offensive efficiency at 127.6 points per 100 possessions. That's better than any team on other than Wisconsin in 2015 (129.0) dating all the way back to the 2002 season. They'll face a tough challenge against a Michigan defense ranked third by KenPom (90.4 points allowed per 100 possessions) and hoping for an uglier game compared to Villanova's free-flowing romp against Kansas in Saturday's national semifinals. Villanova kept the ball moving - sometimes whipping it around the perimeter, other times on drive-and-kickout plays - to stay a step ahead of the Jayhawks' befuddled defense, which left coach Bill Self in a perpetual state of exasperation through what became a 40-minute shooting show. By the end, Villanova had assisted on 12 of its Final Four-record 18 3-pointers, and finished the game with 20 assists on 36 baskets. "It just gets everybody touches, everybody staying aggressive," redshirt junior Mikal Bridges said. "It's kind of tough for maybe a guy throughout the whole game not touching the ball at all. You're just not going to be ready. It's just normal. "But touching the ball every possession and moving without the ball, then when it swings to you and you're open or have to make a play, everybody has confidence in each other to make that play and find each other." The assist-to-basket ratio can offer a glimpse of how well things are working for the Wildcats. They have assisted on 55.6 percent of their baskets in wins, but just 42.6 percent in their four losses - including 39.3 percent in a loss to St. John's on Feb. 7 and 34.6 percent in a loss to Providence a week later. Perhaps not coincidentally, Villanova struggled from outside in both of those games in particular. The Wildcats made 2 of 18 3-pointers in the second half of the loss to the Red Storm, then made 3 of 20 for the game against the Friars. The other thing to watch will be rebounding. Villanova was beaten on the glass in in three of its four losses, with Butler, St. John's and Providence offsetting misses by combining to average 13.7 second-chance points. Yet Villanova's work on the glass on a bad shooting day, along with a tough defensive effort, is why the Wildcats reached San Antonio. Villanova shot just 33 percent and went 4 of 24 from 3-point range in the Elite Eight win against Texas Tech, but took a 51-33 rebounding advantage that included 20 offensive rebounds. It's proof that Villanova can win even if those shots aren't falling. Copyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Florida lawmakers near final action on gun-school safety bill  [SEP]  FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (Reuters) - Florida state lawmakers were due to vote once more on Wednesday on a gun-safety package that would raise the legal age for buying rifles, impose a three-day waiting period on all firearms sales and allow the arming of some public school personnel. The legislation, which narrowly cleared the state Senate on Monday, was spurred by the shooting deaths last month of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and the remarkable lobbying campaign mounted by young survivors of the massacre. The state House of Representatives rejected three dozen amendments to the bill on Tuesday, including a last-ditch bid to strip the legislation of any measures permitting school staff to carry guns to work. The bill was scheduled to return to the House floor on Wednesday for what could be a final vote. Any amendments offered at that stage would require a two-thirds vote for approval. If the bill passes the House unchanged, it would automatically become law within 15 days, unless vetoed or signed by the governor beforehand. Swift action in the Republican-controlled Tallahassee statehouse, where the National Rifle Association has long held sway, signaled a possible turning point in the national debate between gun control advocates and proponents of firearms rights enshrined in the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The bill under consideration this week represented both a break with the NRA on gun sale restrictions and a partial acceptance of its proposition that the best defense against armed criminals is the presence of “good guys with guns.” To that end, the bill creates a program allowing local sheriffs to deputize school staff as volunteer armed “guardians,” subject to special training, mental health and drug screening and a license to carry a concealed weapon. Each school district would decide whether to opt into the program. But classroom teachers are excluded as participants unless they meet one of three narrow criteria - they are Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps instructors, serve in the U.S. military or are former police officers. Otherwise, only non-teacher personnel are eligible, such as administrators, guidance counselors, librarians and coaches. The carve-out for teachers was aimed at winning support from Governor Rick Scott, a Republican and staunch NRA ally who nevertheless is opposed to arming teachers. Many parents, law enforcement officials and legislators in both parties likewise object to allowing guns in the classroom. U.S. President Donald Trump has voiced support for arming teachers as a deterrent to gun violence in schools. A spokeswoman for Scott has said he considered the bill a “step in the right direction” but had concerns with the proposed three-day waiting period for purchases of all firearms. A three-day wait currently applies in Florida only to handgun sales. Another key provision of the bill would raise the minimum legal age for all gun purchases in the state to 21. The minimum age for handguns nationally is already 21. But a person can be as young as 18 to buy a rifle in Florida. Nikolas Cruz, charged with killing 14 students and three adult educators in Parkland on Feb. 14 was 18 years old when he legally purchased the semiautomatic AR-15-style assault rifle used in the massacre, police have said. While state legislators voted against banning assault weapons outright in Florida, the bill would outlaw “bump stocks” that enable a semiautomatic weapon to be fired as if it were a fully automatic machine-gun. The bill also makes it easier for police to temporarily seize guns from people involuntarily committed or deemed a danger to themselves or others by a court. Authorities have said Cruz had a history of mental issues, numerous encounters with police and was expelled from Stoneman Douglas High School last year for disciplinary problems. Law enforcement agencies also acknowledged receiving multiple warnings about his potential for violence before the shooting.
Syria regime pummels besieged Eastern Ghouta  [SEP]  HAMMURIYEH, Syria: Syrian forces pursued a relentless air and ground offensive against Eastern Ghouta on Thursday (Mar 8), moving closer to retaking the rebel enclave but also depriving desperate civilians of vital aid. More than 900 civilians have been killed in the nearly three-week assault on the last rebel enclave outside the capital, where dozens suffered overnight from a suspected chlorine attack. On another front in Syria's complex seven-year war, pro-Turkey rebels seized control of the key northern town of Jandairis from Kurdish fighters. Russia-backed government forces have retaken more than half of Eastern Ghouta, a monitor says, since launching their devastating offensive on the enclave on Feb 18. The fighting has prompted international outrage, culminating in the UN Security Council demanding an immediate ceasefire, aid deliveries and evacuations. On Thursday, air strikes and rocket fire on the towns of Zamalka and Sabqa killed at least 13 civilians, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said. An aid delivery planned for Thursday was meant to bring relief to war-weary civilians inside Eastern Ghouta, which is home to 400,000 inhabitants who have been living under government siege since 2013. But with bombardment continuing, the joint convoy between the United Nations, International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and Syrian Arab Red Crescent could not go through. "The movement of the convoy was not authorised by the Syrian authorities due to security reasons," said Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the UN's humanitarian coordination office (OCHA). It marks the second time this week aid operations have been disrupted by military developments, with food deliveries cut short Monday due to bombardment. Ghouta towns and villages have fallen in quick succession in recent days, with regime forces on the verge of cutting the remaining rebel-held territory into two isolated pockets. A military official said the regime would open up a new "humanitarian corridor" for civilians wishing to flee from the south of the enclave. But Moscow accused the rebels of having attacked two Syrian army checkpoints, causing casualties and further holding up aid deliveries. They were "doing everything possible to prevent residents from leaving", it said in a statement. In the town of Hammuriyeh, AFP's correspondent saw motionless bodies lying in the streets on Thursday after a night of ferocious bombing. Dozens of civilians were treated in the town for breathing difficulties late Wednesday, with medics reporting symptoms consistent with a toxic attack. Doctors at one facility treated at least 29 patients with signs of exposure to chlorine, according to the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), which supports hospitals in Eastern Ghouta. It said victims were suffering from shortness of breath, wheezing, and redness of the eyes. Several families were seen trying to reach fresh air late Wednesday on the roof of a four-storey building in Hammuriyeh, after air strikes on their neighbourhood. "I'm going to suffocate," two children screamed as rescue workers carried them down from the roof. Regime forces have been repeatedly accused of using chlorine on Eastern Ghouta in recent weeks, which both the government and Russia have staunchly denied. Syria's war has killed more than 340,000 people and displaced millions since starting in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests. It has since spiralled into a complex conflict involving world powers. Since Jan 20, Turkey-led rebels have pressed an assault on the Kurdish enclave of Afrin in the north of the country. On Thursday, Turkish forces and allied Syrian rebels seized the town of Jandairis, the Observatory said. "Turkish forces and allied Syrian rebels took full control of Jandairis ... after heavy and sustained bombardment by the Turkish aviation," it said. A rebel commander from the Turkey-backed Faylaq al-Sham group told an AFP reporter in Jandairis the town was under full control. "The entire city of Jandairis was liberated from the secessionist gangs," said the commander, who goes by the name Abu Saleh. "The fight will continue until the whole of Afrin is cleared of them." Turkey says the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) who control the enclave are a "terrorist" group. But the Kurdish militia have also formed the backbone of a US-backed alliance that has successfully fought the Islamic State militant group in Syria. The UN Security Council on February 24 demanded a 30-day cessation of hostilities across the country, but the resolution has done little to bring relief to civilians. The UN's top body met behind closed doors on Wednesday in an attempt to shore up the ceasefire. UN peace envoy Staffan de Mistura briefed the meeting and offered to help broker a deal with Russia to allow fighters in Eastern Ghouta to leave, a diplomat said. Rebel groups operating in Eastern Ghouta have so far refused to discuss evacuating the enclave and have been firing rockets and artillery into eastern areas of Damascus in recent weeks, leaving at least 32 dead the Observatory says.
Hurricane Maria makes landfall in Puerto Rico with 155 mph winds  [SEP]  SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Puerto Rico faced Wednesday what officials said could be the strongest hurricane to ever hit the U.S. territory as they warned it would decimate the power company’s crumbling infrastructure and force the government to rebuild dozens of communities. Maria made landfall early Wednesday in the southeast coastal town of Yabucoa as a Category 4 storm with winds of 155 mph winds, and it was expected to punish the island with life-threatening winds for 12 to 24 hours, forecasters said. Maria had previously been a Category 5 storm with 175 mph winds. “This is going to be an extremely violent phenomenon,” Gov. Ricardo Rossello said. “We have not experienced an event of this magnitude in our modern history.” The number of power outages spiked as Maria approached, with the storm centered early Wednesday about 50 miles southeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico, and moving northwest at 10 mph, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. Maria ties for the eighth strongest storm in Atlantic history, when measured by wind speed. Coming in second is this year’s Irma, which had 185 mph winds and killed 38 people in the Caribbean and another 36 in the U.S. earlier this month. Puerto Rico had long been spared from a direct hit by hurricanes that tend to veer north or south of the island. The last Category 4 hurricane landfall in Puerto Rico occurred in 1932, and the strongest storm to ever hit the island was San Felipe in 1928 with winds of 160 mph. As Maria approached, U.S. President Donald Trump offered his support via Twitter: “Puerto Rico being hit hard by new monster Hurricane. Be careful, our hearts are with you- will be there to help!” More than 4,400 people were in shelters by late Tuesday, along with 105 pets, Rossello said. The storm’s center passed near or over St. Croix overnight Tuesday, prompting U.S. Virgin Islands Gov. Kenneth Mapp to insist that people remain alert. St. Croix was largely spared the widespread damage caused by Hurricane Irma on the chain’s St. Thomas and St. John islands just two weeks ago. But this time, the island would experience five hours of hurricane force winds, Mapp said. “For folks in their homes, I really recommend that you not be in any kind of sleepwear,” he said during a brief news conference. “Make sure you have your shoes on. Make sure you have a jacket around. Something for your head in case your roof should breach. … I don’t really recommend you be sleeping from 11 o’clock to 4 (a.m.). … Be aware of what’s going on around you.” Maria killed one person in the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe when a tree fell on them Tuesday, and two people aboard a boat were reported missing off La Desirade island, just east of Guadeloupe, officials said. About 40 percent of the island — 80,000 homes — were without power and flooding was reported in several communities. The storm also blew over the tiny eastern Caribbean island of Dominica late Monday, where Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit sent out a series of dramatic posts on his Facebook page, including that his own roof had blown away. “The winds are merciless! We shall survive by the grace of God,” Skerrit wrote before communications went down. The storm knocked out communications for the entire island, leaving anyone outside Dominica struggling to determine the extent of damage, though it was clearly widespread. “The situation is really grave,” Consul General Barbara Dailey said in a telephone interview from New York. She said she lost contact with the island about 4 a.m. At that point, officials had learned that 70 percent of homes had lost their roofs, including her own. Flooding was a big concern, given the island’s steep mountains, cut through with rivers that rage even after a heavy rain. Dominica was still recovering from Tropical Storm Erika, which killed 30 people and destroyed more than 370 homes in August 2015. Forecasters said the storm surge from Maria could raise water levels by 6 to 9 feet near the storm’s center. The storm was predicted to bring 10 to 15 inches of rain across the islands, with more in isolated areas. To the north, Hurricane Jose weakened to a tropical storm Tuesday night. Forecasters said dangerous surf and rip currents were likely to continue along the U.S. East Coast but said the storm was unlikely to make landfall. Big waves caused by Jose swept five people off a coastal jetty in Rhode Island and they were hospitalized after being rescued. A tropical storm warning was posted for coastal areas in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and tropical storm watches were up for parts of New York’s Long Island and Connecticut. The AP’s Ben Fox in Miami and Seth Borenstein in Washington contributed to this report.
Palestinians say three killed as Israeli troops fire on Gaza protest  [SEP]  related media assets (image or videos) available.

Israeli soldiers shot dead three Palestinians, including a 14-year-old boy, who were among thousands of people who thronged to the fortified Gaza Strip border on Friday as part of weekly protests launched half a year ago, Gaza health officials said. GAZA: Israeli soldiers shot dead three Palestinians, including a 14-year-old boy, who were among thousands of people who thronged to the fortified Gaza Strip border on Friday as part of weekly protests launched half a year ago, Gaza health officials said. Israel's military said its troops resorted to live fire after explosive devices and rocks were thrown at them and to prevent breaches of the border fence from the Islamist Hamas-controlled enclave. Gaza health officials said 190 people had been wounded. At least 187 Palestinians have been killed since the Gaza protests began on March 30 to demand rights to lands lost to Israel in the 1948 war of its foundation, and the easing of an Israeli-Egyptian economic blockade. A Gaza sniper has killed one Israeli soldier and incendiary devices flown over by Palestinians using kites and helium balloons have set off fires that destroyed tracts of forest and farmland in Israel. Israel accuses Hamas, against which it has fought three wars in the last decade, of having deliberately provoked violence in the protests, a charge Hamas denies. More than 2 million people are packed into Gaza, whose economic plight is a focus of so-far fruitless U.S.-led efforts to restart Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, stalled since 2014.

Search continues in Alaskan waters for helicopter crash victims  [SEP]  The following content is sourced from external partners. We cannot guarantee that it is suitable for the visually or hearing impaired. This content was published on September 30, 2018 7:27 AM (Reuters) - The U.S. Coast Guard continued its search overnight and into early Sunday for three missing people from a helicopter crash in the frigid waters near Lituya Bay, about 116 miles northwest of Juneau, Alaska. A 14-year-old boy was found alive Friday, a few hours after the wreck, suffering from mild hypothermia, but otherwise in good condition, Coast Guard spokesman Nate Littlejohn said. "We are still hoping to find survivors," said Littlejohn. "This is still a rescue operation." Neither the Coast Guard nor the Alaska Department of Public Safety have released the names of the missing people or the youth. But local media, including the Anchorage Daily News, identified the boy as Aiden Pepperd, the son of the owner an Alaska construction and engineering company. Missing are the boy's father Josh Pepperd, 42, his other son Andrew Pepperd, 11, and the pilot, David King, 53, owner of Last Frontier Air Ventures, local media reported. Wreckage from the helicopter has been washing ashore on a beach about three miles east of the Lituya Bay fjord, officials said. A Coast Guard cutter searched the waters and shoreline overnight, Littlejohn said, and a military MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter will resume searching for survivors at first light Sunday.
Patrick Reed holds off charge from Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler to win Masters  [SEP]  AUGUSTA, Ga. — Patrick Reed became famous playing for his country. He won for himself on Sunday at the Masters. Rory McIlroy came after him early. Jordan Spieth briefly tied him for the lead. Murrieta’s Rickie Fowler birdied the last hole to leave him no room for error. Reed never flinched through it all on a raucous afternoon at Augusta National, calmly rolling in a 3-foot par putt for a 1-under 71 and a one-shot victory. Captain America is now the Masters champion. Even as the loudest cheers were for everyone else, Reed earned all the respect with two big birdie putts on the back nine, one key par and plenty of grit. The 27-year-old Texan becomes the fourth straight Masters champion to win his first major. Fowler holed an 8-foot birdie putt on the final hole for a 67. He had to settle for his third runner-up finish in a major. He left the scoring cabin when Reed two-putted for par down the slippery slope on the 18th green and waited for a chance to greet Reed. “Glad I at least made the last one, make him earn it,” Fowler said with a grin. “You had to do it didn’t you?” Reed told him as they exchanged a hug. “You had to birdie the last.” Spieth put up the most unlikely fight and was on the verge of the greatest comeback in Masters history. He started nine shots behind going into the final round, and was inches away on two shots from a chance at another green jacket. His tee shot on the 18th clipped the last branch in his way, dropping his ball some 267 yards from the green. His 8-foot par putt for a record-tying 63 narrowly missed on the right. He had to settle for a 64. Reed won for the sixth time in his PGA Tour career, though he was best known for the trophies he shared at the Ryder Cup. He is ferocious in match play, especially the team variety, and his singles victory over McIlroy at Hazeltine in 2016 led to the nickname of Captain America. McIlroy, meanwhile, will have to wait another year for a shot at the career Grand Slam. Trailing by three shots to start the final round, he closed to within one shot after two holes. That was as close as he came. McIlroy’s putter betrayed him, and he was never a factor on the back nine. He closed with a 74 and tied for fifth.
Chinese space lab to crash to earth in fiery show | DW | 31.03.2018  [SEP]  The European Space Agency (ESA) Saturday pushed back the time that Tiangong-1 is re-expected to enter the earth's atmosphere, saying it would likely take place between Sunday afternoon UTC and early Monday morning. The agency had originally forecasted re-entry between midday Saturday UTC and Sunday. The change in the defunct Chinese space lab's predicted return to earth was due to changes in the conditions of solar activity, the ESA said in a blog post. A high-speed stream of sun particles failed to materialize as expected, leading to calmer space weather and no increase in the density of the upper atmosphere, which would have pulled the 8.5-metric-ton (9.4-ton) Tiangong-1 down towards earth at a faster rate. ESA said the spacecraft could land anywhere between 43 degrees north latitude and 43 degrees south latitude. However, the agency emphasized the uncertainty around predicted re-entry information, stating: "At no time will a precise time/location prediction from ESA be possible." Tiangong-1, or "Heavenly Palace," was launched into orbit in September 2011. A controlled return guided by ground engineers to earth became impossible after the lab ceased functioning in March 2016. The spacecraft will mostly burn up as it re-enters Earth's atmosphere due to the heat generated by its passage, ESA said. However, it added that some craft parts could survive the atmospheric re-entry and reach the Earth's surface. The pieces could land over an area "that is thousands of kilometers in length and tens of kilometers wide," but the agency highlighted that "a large part of the Earth is covered by water or is uninhabited." "Hence the personal probability of being hit by a piece of debris from the Tiangong-1 is actually 10 million times smaller than the yearly chance of being hit by lightning," ESA said. Chinese authorities said that the spacecraft's fiery disintegration will provide a "splendid" show similar to a meteor shower, AFP reported. Scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute for High-frequency Physics and Radar Technology (FHR), located just south of the western German city of Bonn, is assisting ESA with radar technology and will be following Tiangong-1's fiery return to earth. The institute will be regularly checking to see whether the descending lab remains intact or whether pieces have broken off. The FHR said that Germany faces no risk from Tiangong-1's flaming fall to earth. Read more: Germany’s new astronaut Matthias Maurer eyes 2020 mission and Chinese space ties
Protesters Beaten in 'Brutal Attack' During Turkish President's United States Visit  [SEP]  Authorities in Washington, D.C. are investigating what they called "a brutal attack on peaceful protesters" outside the home of Turkey ambassador Serdar Kilic's home on 16 May 2017. Initial reports described the fight, which left several people visibly bloodied, as a "clash" between supporters of Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Erdogan's security detail, and people protesting Erdogan's meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump earlier in the day.

At least nine injured in Ohio State University attack  [SEP]  At least nine people were injured at Ohio State University in an attack that was carried out by two assailants at the Columbus campus on Monday, according to local officials and media. Local media reported that the injured were both shot and stabbed. The nine victims were taken to local hospitals, a spokeswoman with the Columbus Fire Department said. One person was in critical condition, and the others were stable. The nature of their injuries was not immediately known. A suspected attacker was shot, local television station WBNS reported, citing law enforcement sources. WBNS said four of the injured suffered gunshot wounds. WBNS, citing law enforcement, reported the attack began with a person armed with a gun and another individual with a knife got out of a sport utility vehicle at a university engineering building. At least some victims were stabbed, the station reported. Columbus police said on Twitter they were assisting university law enforcement. Representatives for the university did not immediately return calls. "Ohio's thoughts and prayers go out to the Ohio State community," Ohio Governor John Kasich said in a statement. "Be safe, listen to first responders." Ohio State student Wyatt Crosher told CNN he heard what sounded like gunfire and then emergency sirens.
Tiger Woods found asleep at wheel of car  [SEP]  Fourteen-time major winner Tiger Woods was discovered by local police asleep at the wheel of his vehicle on the morning of his arrest. The American golfer was detained in the early hours of Monday morning on suspicion driving under the influence - claims he later denied, putting it down to an "unexpected reaction" to prescribed medication A report released by Jupiter Police shows that Woods had the engine running and brake lights illuminated on his 2015 Mercedes-Benz, with the right turn signal flashing. The former world number one had to be awoken by officers and, with his speech slurred, insisted that he did not know how he got to where he was. It was found that Woods did not have alcohol in his system, however, registering a 0.000 on a breathalyser and urine test.

Turkish warplanes kill 51 Islamic State militants in Syria - milita...  [SEP]  ANKARA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Turkish warplanes killed 51 Islamic State militants in operations over the last 24 hours, the military said in a statement on Thursday. Warplanes destroyed 85 Islamic State targets in the areas of al-Bab, Tadif, Kabbasin and Bzagah, including buildings and vehicles. Turkey launched an operation, dubbed "Euphrates Shield", to drive jihadists away from the Syrian border more than five months ago and has been besieging the Islamic State controlled town of al-Bab for weeks.

History and Rafa Nadal is against an upset by Kevin Anderson  [SEP]  Pity poor Kevin Anderson. He spends a lifetime waiting to be an overnight sensation, he reaches his first grand slam final by firing 22 aces past Pablo Carreno Busta on Friday and now, in his moment of glory, he has to stand in front of the freight train that is Rafael Nadal on track for a 16th major trophy and his third US Open title. At 31, Anderson is two weeks older than Nadal; they have known each other from their first days on tour. But while Nadal has hoovered up major trophies for the past 12 years, the tall and likeable South African with the thumping serve has won just three small titles in his career and, until this week, he had only reached one grand slam quarter-final in his career. They have met four times before but the result never seems to change: Nadal wins. Sure enough, Anderson took a set from his nemesis once, but that was two years ago and it was indoors and at the end of the season when everyone is tired. This is oh, so different. The way Nadal crushed Juan Martin del Potro on Friday night was enough to put the wind up anyone, be they a debutant finalist or a serial champion. Del Potro edged ahead to take the first set while Nadal’s uncle and coach, Toni, watched on. Asked what was going wrong with his nephew’s game, Toni was very clear. “The problem is our forehand,” Toni said. He regards tennis as a team sport so it is not Rafa’s forehand but “our” forehand. “When we hit our forehand to the backhand of Del Potro, it is not enough. Rafael needs to have more power with all his shots.” Down on court, Nadal was of a similar mind. In the few seconds of thinking time allowed at the change of ends, the world No.1 devised a new plan and for the next three sets, he was unstoppable. He pounded his forehand, he played with power but he also played with craft and guile. He attacked with blood in his eye and he defended as if his life depended upon it. Del Potro, increasingly weary as the sets flew by him, could do nothing to stop Nadal’s march to the final. “He played so smart from the second set till the end of the match,” Del Potro said. “He played well. Against Rafa, you must hit winners from both sides. I didn’t tonight. “He improved very much his game after the second set, and his ball come too fast from both sides.” Nadal has been playing well from the very start of the year but now, as everyone else is flagging and the season moves into the final straight, he is playing better than ever. “I wake up today and say to myself, ‘today is the day that I’ll play. I need to play with the right energy, and I need to increase the level of my game’,” Nadal said. “And I know that. A lot of times I know that, and it didn’t happen, but today it happened.” When the US Open began, Nadal was practising well but playing so-so. Then, as the tournament moved into the second week, Nadal was practising well and playing like a man possessed. The title seems to be his for the taking.
Journey And Steve Perry Go Their Separate Ways At Rock Hall, Bandmates React To Reunion With Ex-Lead Singer – Long Beach City College Viking  [SEP]  Journey was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but their celebratory jam did not include longtime lead singer Steve Perry. The aloof former frontman joined Journey for the first time since the band’s 2005 Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony as they accepted the honor at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, N.Y., but he then left the building when Journey’s working lineup—guitarist Neal Schon, keyboardist Jonathan Cain, bass player Ross Valory, drummer Steve Smith and current singer Arnel Pineda—took the stage to perform. Journey’s three-song set included “Separate Ways,” “Lights,” and “Don’t Stop Believin’,” which Schon dedicated to the band’s former singer, according to Ultimate Classic Rock. While Perry didn’t participate in the performance, former Journey members Gregg Rolie and Aynsley Dunbar joined the group to perform the 1978 hit “Lights.” [Image by Mike Coppola/Getty Images] Journey fans were understandably disappointed that Steve Perry skipped out on a long-awaited performance. The estranged singer hasn’t performed with Journey since a one-off event in 1991, and many people thought the ex-bandmates would reunite on stage. The Steve Perry drama unfolded up to the last minute. Just hours before the Rock Hall ceremony, TMZ reported that Perry would be singing one song with Journey, then the site posted an update that said the band’s reps “know nothing about” a reunion performance and that band’s three songs had already been blocked for the show. Just hours before the ceremony in New York, Journey’s rep Larry Solters told TMZ point blank: “Steve Perry will NOT be performing tonight.” But a source for the Rock Hall production maintained the wild card would be if “Perry just decides to sing when he gets onstage.” Perry decided not to, but he did have some heartfelt words for his former bandmates in his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame speech, which was posted by Rolling Stone. The singer recounted his early days scouting Journey, citing “the magic fingers of Neal Schon’s guitar,” and thanking Dunbar, Rolie, Smith, Cain, and Valory for working with him. Perry also reserved a special shout-out to current Journey singer Arnel Pineda (whom the band first discovered on YouTube), the team at Columbia Records, the original Journey road crew, and, of course, the fans, who he said have always stayed close to him. “I’ve been gone a long time, I understand that,” the ex-Journey singer said. “But I want you to know, you’ve never not been in my heart. I want you to know that. And I love every single one of you.” [Image by Mike Coppola/Getty Images] In his own speech, Schon also had kind words for his former bandmate. “Steve Perry,” the Journey guitarist said. “Thank you for reviving my art, for finding me“ While Journey fans were ultimately disappointed that Steve Perry opted not to join the band onstage, the band members were gracious. Schon later tweeted that it was great to see Steve after all these years, and he described him as “one in a million.” And Pineda went completely fanboy. The Journey lead singer posted a photo of himself getting a hug from Perry, saying he waited 35 years to meet his hero. Steve Perry didn’t join Journey for a performance or in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame press room, and now he has seemingly gone his separate ways from the band for good. In May, Journey is set to perform at The Joint at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas and the band will then hit the road for a tour this summer. Take a look at the video below to see Journey’s reunion with Steve Perry and the band’s speeches at the Rock and Roll of Fame. [Featured Image by Mike Coppola/Getty Images]
Another NASA spacecraft runs out of steam, 2nd this week  [SEP]  Another NASA spacecraft runs out of steam, 2nd this week CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — NASA has lost a second spacecraft this week, ending a fruitful mission in the asteroid belt. Running low on fuel for some time, the Dawn spacecraft this week stopped communicating with flight controllers. Its prolonged silence prompted NASA to declare it dead Thursday, two days after delivering eulogies to the planet-hunting Kepler Space Telescope. The 9 ½-year-old Kepler also ran out of fuel, needed for pointing the spacecraft. They both kept working longer than anticipated and their demise had been expected. Propelled by three ion engines, the 11-year-old Dawn was the first spacecraft to orbit an object in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and also the first to orbit two places beyond Earth. After circling the asteroid Vesta, Dawn went into orbit around the dwarf planet Ceres. Mission director and chief engineer Marc Rayman insisted he wasn't sad. Rather, he said in an email, "I'm thrilled it was so fantastically exciting and productive. Dawn was a spectacular success by any measure. It carried humankind on a truly amazing deep space adventure with stunning discoveries." Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt, followed by Vesta. The "astounding" images collected by Dawn are shedding light on the history and evolution of our solar system, said NASA's science mission chief, Thomas Zurbuchen. Dawn should remain in orbit around Ceres for decades, according to NASA. "To me, that is a fitting end to an extraordinary extraterrestrial expedition," Rayman said.

Poll shows Pence, who took tougher line than Trump on Russia,...  [SEP]  FARMVILLE, Va. — U.S. Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence called Russian President Vladimir Putin a "small and bullying leader" and condemned his actions in Syria, taking a harder line than Donald Trump at a contentious debate Tuesday, Oct. 4, with Democratic rival Tim Kaine. Pence's denunciation of Putin for his interference in the Syrian civil war and support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was a departure from the frequent praise of Putin by Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, who has called him a better leader than U.S. President Barack Obama and said he could work with him. "The small and bullying leader of Russia is now dictating terms to the United States," Pence said. "The greatest nation on earth just withdraws from talks about a ceasefire, while Vladimir Putin puts a missile defense system in Syria." The encounter between Pence and Kaine, who is No. 2 to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, was the only such debate between the vice presidential contenders before the Nov. 8 election, and the two spent most of their time attacking each other's running mates. For more than 90 minutes at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia, neither Pence nor Kaine appeared to deliver a knockout punch. Pence sought to project an image as a reassuring presence to the bombastic Trump, while Kaine tried to frighten voters away from Trump and make Clinton seem more trustworthy. A CNN/ORC snap poll declared Pence the winner with 48 percent support, compared with Kaine's 42 percent. It set the table for a second presidential debate looming on Sunday in St. Louis between Clinton and Trump, who needs to rebound from a rocky performance from his first debate, one that gave Clinton a boost in national opinion polls with Election Day only five weeks away. Pence's comments raised eyebrows among establishment Republicans as to whether the governor of Indiana was breaking ranks with Trump on Russia. Trump himself earlier in the day condemned Russian bombing in Syria after the United States withdrew from ceasefire talks with Russia. Conservatives who do not support Trump liked Pence's view. "Pence's foreign policy is fine. Too bad it isn't Trump's," tweeted Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard magazine. Pence said "the provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength" and that if Russia chooses to continue to be involved in "barbaric" attacks on civilians, "the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike military targets of the Assad regime." Pence's blunt comments on Russia, more in line with thinking by traditional Republicans, came in response to Kaine's charge that Trump was too cozy with the Russian leader. Kaine, a U.S. senator from Virginia, said Clinton would be tough in dealing with Putin. "Donald Trump, again and again, has praised Vladimir Putin. And it's clear that he has business dealings with Russian oligarchs who are very connected to Putin," Kaine said. Democrats were quick to point out the discrepancy between Trump and his running mate on Russia. "All of a sudden we hear tough talk about Vladimir Putin. It's the exact opposite of what Donald Trump has been saying," said Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook. Pence's toughened position on Russia gave him an opening to declare that Clinton had been outfoxed when she attempted a U.S. reset in relations with Russia when she was Obama's secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Bickering between Kaine and Pence was so intense that they frequently talked over each other. Kaine was seen by television commentators as being overprepared and overeager as he circled back to Trump's refusal to release his tax records at almost every opportunity. Kaine called the Republican presidential nominee a danger to U.S. national security and someone who denigrates women and minorities and appears to pay little in federal taxes. Kaine drew Pence's ire by hearkening back to a remark from former Republican President Ronald Reagan that some fool or maniac with a nuclear weapon could trigger a catastrophic event. "And I think that's who Governor Pence's running mate is," Kaine said. Pence shot back: "Senator, senator, that was even beneath you and Hillary Clinton and that's pretty low." Kaine repeatedly sought to persuade Pence to defend Trump's positions, but Pence steadfastly refused to take the bait. One of Kaine's most aggressive lines of attack was over Trump's refusal to release his tax records, a decision that breaks with the practice of all other presidential nominees in modern history. The New York Times reported last weekend that Trump had taken a $916 million tax loss in 1995 and may have avoided paying federal taxes for 18 years because of it. "Governor Pence had to give Donald Trump his tax returns to show he is qualified to be vice president. Donald Trump has to give his tax returns to show he is qualified to be president," Kaine said. Pence defended Trump, saying the New York real estate developer had created thousands of jobs and had used U.S. tax laws as they were designed to be used. "Why won't he release his taxes?" Kaine fired back.

The Croatia defender set up the equalizer in the second half and then saved a likely goal by clearing a shot off the line in the first half of extra time. Those two moments of excellence helped Croatia reach its first World Cup final following a 2-1 win over England on Wednesday, setting up a title match against France. Vrsaljko, who plays for Atletico Madrid, had struggled to be ready for the match after playing in two previous extra-time matches, but he found the strength to lift his tired, battered team to a comeback win. With Croatia trailing 1-0, Vrsaljko curled in the cross that Ivan Perisic volleyed into the net in the 68th minute. In extra time, he leaped high to block John Stones' header, keeping Croatia in the game before Mario Mandzukic scored the winning goal about 10 minutes later. "Just a memorable night. We deserved to be in that final after such an amazing effort," Croatia midfielder Ivan Rakitic said. "For us, it was impressive to watch a team such as the English, that is so strong physically, and they couldn't keep up anymore, and we did have that energy." The Croats entered the match after winning their previous two games on penalty kicks, but they showed no sign of fatigue in the second half against England. With three straight extra-time matches, Croatia has played the equivalent a full 90-minute match more than France has through six games in Russia. France also has an extra day of rest after beating Belgium 1-0 on Tuesday. Besides scoring, Perisic also hit the post for the second straight game and set up Mandzukic's winner, heading a poor clearance toward the Juventus striker to score. The victory improves Croatia's previous best showing at the World Cup, which ended in a 1998 semifinal loss to the host French. "We have a good opportunity to give them something back for 20 years ago when they reached the final," Croatia defender Dejan Lovren said. "Maybe it's our time to revenge something but it's a tough game and it will be difficult."
Robert Mueller impanels grand jury in Russia probe  [SEP]  A grand jury has been impaneled to hear evidence in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election and potential coordination with the Trump campaign, according to the Wall Street Journal. The move, reported Thursday, is a sign that Mr. Mueller’s investigation is gaining momentum and entering a new phase. The grand jury, assembled in D.C., has already been seated and begun its work investigating Russian election interference. Special Counsel spokesman Joshua Stueve declined to comment on the ongoing investigation. Grand jury deliberations are secret, with juries impaneled to consider whether there is evidence to indict someone of a crime. By assembling a grand jury, the special counsel investigators will be able to subpoena documents and question witnesses under oath. Before Mr. Mueller was appointed to oversee the Russia probe, a grand jury was assembled in Alexandria, Virginia to consider evidence against former national security advisor Michael Flynn. Jay Sekulow, an attorney for Mr. Trump, said a grand jury was not a cause for alarm. “With respect to the impaneling of the grand jury, we have no reason to believe that the president is under investigation,” he said in a statement to The Washington Times.
Sao Paulo tower used by squatters collapses in fire  [SEP]  A 24-storey building used by squatters in the center of Sao Paulo, Brazil’s biggest city, collapsed early Tuesday after a blaze that tore through the structure, leaving at least three missing. Survivors described waking in the night to find themselves surrounded by flames and escaping with their children before the tower turned to rubble. Scores of homeless families were occupying the building, according to officials. However, despite the ferocity of the blaze, only one person was listed as almost certainly dead. “There are some missing, approximately three, with one very likely a fatality,” Ricardo Peixoto, a firefighters’ commander, told AFP. “We don’t know how many people were in the building so we don’t know whether we’ll find more victims in the ruins.” So far, 250 people who’d been living in the building have been registered after the blaze, city security official Jose Roberto said. The fire began overnight and spread rapidly, turning the building into an inferno before it fell down. Dramatic pictures tweeted by the fire service showed flames shooting up the sides of the whole tower, moments before it was reduced to a heap of smoking ruins. An adjacent church was also damaged. “We got the call at around 1:30 am (0230 GMT) and we came at once, a few minutes later, and about five floors of the building were on fire,” Peixoto said. “Fifteen or 20 minutes later the building fell.” Fifty-seven vehicles and 160 firefighters were deployed to the scene, the department said. Sao Paulo is Brazil’s financial capital and the most populous city in Latin America, but suffers huge economic inequality. Poor families often squat in disused buildings or set up tents and shacks on vacant land, sometimes next to wealthy areas. President Michel Temer, who is Brazil’s most unpopular leader on record, with single-digit approval ratings, got a hostile reception when he briefly visited the scene. One survivor, 26-year-old Henrique, said he managed to get out from the third floor with his girlfriend and their dog. “We woke and the building was already on fire,” he said. “We struggle so much and now we’ve lost everything.” Another man, Jose Antonio, described the frantic escape from the sixth floor, where he lived with his wife, three children and sister-in-law. “I was unsure if my son had taken my youngest daughter,” Antonio, 48, told AFP. “There was still time to go back so I returned, I looked around, I patted the mattresses. There wasn’t time to take anything. I patted the mattresses, saw no one was at home anymore, then I went down behind them shouting their names to see if they had gone down.” Sao Paulo state Governor Marcio Franca said “it was a tragedy waiting to happen…. This building didn’t have even the minimum conditions for habitation. The state should not have allowed it to be occupied.” From a safety point of view, the building was a ticking bomb, Peixoto said. “There was no security, there were not adequate electrical installations, there were no safe staircases, there were piles of rubbish — there was everything you need to start a major fire,” he said.
Google accused of bias against women in lawsuit by former employees  [SEP]  Three former Google employees on Thursday filed a class-action lawsuit against the tech giant, alleging it discriminated against women in pay and promotions, building on a debate of whether gender bias is pervasive at Google. The three women claim that Google placed them in lower job levels than their similarly qualified males, leading to lower pay, and denied the women promotions or transitions to other teams that would have led to better career advancement. The complaint, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, is the latest chapter in a recent flare-up over gender equality at Google. Thursday’s complaint comes on the heels of an accusation by the Labor Department that Google systematically underpays its female employees. And Google last month fired James Damore, an engineer, for publishing a memo that attributed Google’s gender gap in part to biological differences, not sexism. Google, part of Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.07% GOOGL, -1.08% , has said its annual salary analyses show no pay gap among its more than 75,000 employees. Lawyers for the three plaintiffs said more than 90 current and former Google employees came forward to say they faced discrimination. An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.

Light plane crashes near Melbourne in Australia  [SEP]  A small plane carrying five people crashed into a shopping center near an airport outside Melbourne, Australia's second-largest city, on Tuesday and officials said an unknown number of people may have been killed.

Column: Dodgers return to the World Series where they will try to complete the dream that ended in a nightmare last season  [SEP]  It has stared at them for a year now, dancing beyond their reach, swaggering around their pain, teasing, taunting, challenging. On a cold Saturday night at Miller Park, a blue-hot baseball team finally confronted their demon, stuck their chin in its face, and challenged it to another fight. Welcome back, Dodgers, to the World Series. Welcome back to your dream. Welcome back to your nightmare. Advertisement This time, one more win, OK? After spending six months investing all their energy in returning to the spot that left them so empty, the Dodgers were rewarded with a second consecutive World Series berth after a 5-1 comeback victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in the deciding Game 7 of the National League Championship Series. They will play the favored American League champion Boston Red Sox beginning Tuesday in Boston, a tough task, but the Dodgers will revel in it. After losing last year’s World Series to the Houston Astros in Game 7, they spent all season in search of redemption, and they finally earned that chance on a night of rich history and dazzling beauty. And, oh yeah, also a night of poetic symmetry, as the final score exactly matched the score of last year’s lost World Series Game 7. Advertisement “It’s a magical thing,” said co-owner Peter Guber, standing amid the spraying champagne of the Dodgers’ fourth such party in three weeks. It ended with Clayton Kershaw fittingly on the mound, the ace pitching the ninth inning in relief, his giant figure smothered by hugging and leaping Dodgers who clearly can’t wait to begin the final leg of their journey. “There was a message in last year’s Game 7, we learned from that as a team, and everybody thought about this moment, getting back to the World Series,” said Chris Taylor. 1 / 42 Dodgers Yasiel Puig celebrates with Manny Machado in locker room after capturing the National League Championship Series.

(Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times) The franchise’s first consecutive World Series appearances in 40 years was a milestone that crossed time zones. Back in Los Angeles, in the middle of LeBron James’ Staples Center debut, the video board broadcast the final out to a roaring crowd and Randy Newman singing, “I Love L.A.’” In the joyous Miller Park visiting clubhouse, any singing would have been drowned out by the spraying and screaming and thinking about the next step. “It’s not a time to take a breath and relax,’’ said Justin Turner. “We’re not satisfied with being there. We want to show up and win four games and be the last team standing.’’ This was the 30th anniversary of the day the Dodgers clinched their last World Series championship, a reminder of the drought that shadows their every move. Yet it was a victory filled with the kind of memories that could allow this bunch to write a new history. Advertisement They won with an audacious two-strike bunt single by the constantly booed Manny Machado that led to a two-run homer by Cody Bellinger in the second inning. “It was unbelievable how he actually got the bunt down, and to think about getting the bunt down,” said Bellinger. They won with a stunning, lunging, over-the-shoulder catch by Taylor in deep left field to keep the tying run from scoring in in the fifth inning. “It was a big moment,’’ said Taylor. “I’m just glad I made the play.” They won with rookie starter Walker Buehler rising up to equal the biggest moment of his young career with one allowed run in 42/3 innings, and kid Julio Urias coming out of nowhere to record the biggest out of his career. And, of course, this emotionally swinging team couldn’t have done it without Yasiel Puig putting on a nutty show with a game-clinching three-run homer in the sixth inning featuring an accompanying trot filled with a veritable Swiss Army knife of gestures. He did a crotch chop. He did a throat slash. He did a chest thump. He raised the roof. He danced in the dirt. It was all in good fun, but there is much more fun to be had, if they can navigate the difficulties awaiting them next week at Fenway Park. Advertisement “Great for baseball, two storied franchises going head to head,” said Dodger manager Dave Roberts. “It’s going to be a great series.” The Red Sox had the best record in baseball this season with 108 wins, 16 more than the Dodgers. The Red Sox breezed through their postseason, winning seven of nine games. The Red Sox will be favored in this series by anybody who has seen them play. Any of that sound familiar? They sound just like the Dodgers in last season’s World Series against the Houston Astros, no? So anything can happen, something which the Dodgers proved in this NLCS, a thrill ride featuring memorable highs and striking lows. “This is definitely a more battle-tested group,” said General Manager Farhan Zaidi. “Last year we kind of cruised through the season and the first two rounds of the playoffs. This year has definitely been more of a grind getting to this point.” The Dodgers could have clinched this Friday, but suffered a dispirited Game 6 loss, sending them stumbling into Game 7. But once they arrived, they soared. “We had a lot of doubters along the way, but not in here, nobody doubted us in here,” said Taylor. After Christian Yelich had given the Brewers a 1-0 lead after with a first-inning homer, Machado led off the second amid deafening boos by taking a huge risk with a two-strike bunt attempt. It was a perfect, the ball crawling toward third base, and he was safe at first with a single. When Machado stopped running, he endeared himself further to all of Wisconsin by grabbing his crotch, a vile gesture by a bad actor, at which point the fans chanted, “You still suck, you still suck!” But four pitches later, it was all forgotten when Bellinger, who was named the NLCS MVP, drove a pitch into the right-field seats, adding to his game-winning hit in the 13th inning in Game 4. The lead seemed on the verge of evaporating in the fifth inning after Lorenzo Cain hit a two-out double into the left-field corner, chasing Buehler and bringing in Urias, who pitched in three regular season games while recovering from shoulder surgery. Yelich greeted Urias with a line shot deep to left-center field, but somehow Taylor was able to chase it down and nab it with an outstretched glove while running and falling with his back to home plate. It ended the inning and essentially demoralized the Brewers, who never made much of a peep again. As for that 30th-anniversary stuff, Orel Hershiser, the winning pitcher in that last World Series championship victory against Oakland, recently turned 60. The winning manager, Tom Lasorda, is 91. That last title was a long time ago. The Dodgers’ close call last October made the drought seem even longer. Now they have another shot. That’s all they’ve wanted.

Iraqi lawmakers demand US withdrawal after Trump visit  [SEP]  BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraqi lawmakers are seizing on President Donald Trump's surprise visit to demand U.S. forces leave the country. Politicians from both sides of Iraq's political divide are calling on parliament to vote to expel U.S. troops. Approximately 5,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Iraq as part of the coalition against the Islamic State group. Foreign influence has become a hot-button issue in a year that saw supporters of populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr win the largest share of votes in May elections. Al-Sadr has called for curbing U.S. and Iranian involvement in Iraqi affairs. Trump spent three hours at a U.S. air base meeting with American troops on an unannounced visit Wednesday. He left without meeting any Iraqi officials. Lawmakers decried the visit as arrogant and a violation of Iraqi sovereignty.
At least 50 dead, 100 burned as Congo tanker truck burns; villagers had rushed to collect leaking fuel  [SEP]  KINSHASA, Congo (AP) — At least 50 dead, 100 burned as Congo tanker truck burns; villagers had rushed to collect leaking fuel.
ForMin Comanescu: Experience with Canada trade agreement cannot but be followed in trade agreement with US | Nine O`Clock  [SEP]  Romania’s Foreign Minister Lazar Comanescu said Thursday, in relation to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between the European Union and Canada, that differentiated approaches of European citizens by a third party are not normal, adding that this agreement will be an experience that cannot but be followed in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the EU and the US. In an interview to the RFI radio broadcaster, Comanescu said that Romania is one of the strongest supporters inside the European Union of a solid transatlantic framework, because agreements such as those with Canada and with the US pave the way for new opportunities, including for the Romanian economy. The Romanian head diplomat added that an agreement between the EU and Canada should not allow discrimination against some of the European Union citizens. “We cannot think of any agreement formula between, on the one hand the European Union, which means Romania as well, and Canada, on the other, under which the principle of free movement of persons will apply only to a part of the European Union citizens. That would mean discrimination; it would mean accepting an agreement that will discriminate against Romanian and Bulgarian nationals. (…) That is the essential part we have discussed and continue to do so with our Canadian partners (…) I believe there are reasons for us to be optimistic that in the end a formula will be worked out that will adequately reflect this part that is extremely important to Romania; that would be the compromise for us to sign and then ratify the treaty with Canada,” said Comanescu. He added that this is not stymieing negotiations over the agreement, but an effort to find a solution for the agreement to be signed. Moreover, Comanescu said Romania’s European partners are supporting Romania’s point of view. “The president of the European Commission and the European commissioners in charge with the matter, including Vice-President of the European Commission Federica Mogherini, have acted and continues to act on the same topic and with this message of the importance for all the European citizens to enjoy equal treatment under the agreement. Besides having bilateral meetings with them, I have also had mutual exchanges of opinions to see how we can act to solve this very important problem from an ethical perspective as well, not just from an economic one. Differentiated approaches of European citizens by a third party are not normal, even when the third party is a very important partner,” said Comanescu. Asked about whether or not this could be the model for the agreement with the US, Comanescu said: “That will certainly be an experience that cannot but be followed.”
Volkswagen fined €1bn in Germany for emissions cheating scandal  [SEP]  Prosecutors in Germany yesterday slapped Volkswagen with a €1bn (£880m) fine over the emissions cheating scandal which rocked the car manufacturing giant. The fine consisted of €5m in legal penalties and €995m to account for the “economic benefits” it received from the cheating, the firm said in a statement. Regulators discovered in 2015 that the iconic German firm added software to its diesel cars designed to understate the amount of toxic emissions under test conditions. Volkswagen has already paid more than £20bn in settlements and regulatory fines. Former chief executive Martin Winterkorn also faces charges in the US along with five other executives related to the scandal, which affected over 11m vehicles. The company said it will not lodge an appeal against the punishment and that it accepts responsibility. The fine is a “further major step” in its efforts to put the scandal behind it, it said, although it still faces civil claims and claims from vehicle owners. “The Prosecutor’s Office in Braunschweig ascertained a violation of supervisory duties,” the prosecutor’s office said in a statement, according to Reuters.
German prosecutor requests Puigdemont extradition to Spain  [SEP]  Berlin (AFP) - German prosecutors on Tuesday asked a court to order the extradition of Catalonia's ousted president Carles Puigdemont on a rebellion charge following his arrest in Germany last month. The request comes after protests by independence supporters at the weekend in Berlin and Catalonia calling for Puigdemont's immediate release. "The prosecutor's office of Schleswig-Holstein state applied for an extradition arrest warrant against former Catalonian regional president Carles Puigdemont from the superior regional court," it said in a statement. It was not immediately clear when the court would rule on Puigdemont's possible extradition. Puigdemont was arrested by German police on March 25 as he was travelling from Finland back to Belgium, where he has been living in self-imposed exile since Catalonia's failed independence bid last October. The detention came two days after a Spanish judge issued European arrest warrants for Puigdemont and other fugitive separatist leaders. They have been ordered to stand trial for rebellion, misuse of public funds and disobeying the state for organising last year's referendum on Catalan independence, which Madrid deemed illegal. Puigdemont's arrest has sent tensions soaring at home, triggering a wave of protests in the wealthy northeastern Spanish region. German judges have ordered Puigdemont to remain in custody in the northern town of Neumuenster as they mull Spain's request for him to be handed over. They have 60 days to make a decision. German media say the request has been complicated by the fact that rebellion, which carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in jail in Spain, is not a crime under German law. However the prosecutor's office argued in its statement that the rebellion charge "contains in essence the accusation of calling an unconstitutional referendum despite violent riots that could be expected" matching the German charge of "treason". "Word-for-word conformance between the German and Spanish criminal codes is thus not legally required," it said.
Appeals court: Grandparents not part of Trump’s travel ban  [SEP]  SEATTLE (AP) — A federal appeals court on Thursday rejected the Trump administration’s limited view of who is allowed into the United States under the president’s travel ban, saying grandparents, cousins and similarly close relations of people in the U.S. should not be prevented from coming to the country. The unanimous ruling from three judges on the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also cleared the way for refugees accepted by a resettlement agency to travel here. The decision upheld a ruling by a federal judge in Hawaii who found the administration’s view too strict. “Stated simply, the government does not offer a persuasive explanation for why a mother-in-law is clearly a bona fide relationship, in the Supreme Court’s prior reasoning, but a grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, or cousin is not,” the 9th Circuit said. The appeals panel wrote that under typical court rules, its ruling would not take effect for at least 52 days. But in this instance, the judges said, many refugees would be “gravely imperiled” by such a delay, so the decision will take effect in five days. “Refugees’ lives remain in vulnerable limbo during the pendency of the Supreme Court’s stay,” they wrote. “Refugees have only a narrow window of time to complete their travel, as certain security and medical checks expire and must then be reinitiated.” The Justice Department said it would appeal. “The Supreme Court has stepped in to correct these lower courts before, and we will now return to the Supreme Court to vindicate the executive branch’s duty to protect the nation,” the agency said in a statement. The U.S. Supreme Court said in June that President Donald Trump’s 90-day ban on visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen can be enforced pending arguments scheduled for October, partially overturning lower-court rulings. But the justices said it should not apply to visitors who have a “bona fide relationship” with people or organizations in the U.S., such as close family ties or a job offer. That set the stage for much disagreement over what constitutes a bona fide relationship. The government interpreted such family relations to include immediate family members and in-laws, but not grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles. The judge in Hawaii overruled that interpretation, expanding the definition of who can enter the country to the other categories of relatives. He also overruled the government’s assertion that refugees from those countries should be banned even if a resettlement agency in the U.S. had agreed to take them in. The administration argued that resettlement agencies have a relationship with the government, not with individual refugees. The appeals court rejected that, focusing on the harm the travel ban might impose on people or organizations in the U.S. Resettlement agencies have spent time and money securing rental housing, buying furniture and performing other tasks that would be in vain if the refugees were blocked, the 9th Circuit said. They also would lose out on government funding for the resettlement services. Lawyers for the government and the state of Hawaii, which challenged the travel ban, argued the case in Seattle last week. Deputy assistant attorney general Hashim Mooppan ran into tough questions as soon as he began arguing the government’s case, with Judge Ronald Gould asking him from “what universe” the administration took its position that grandparents don’t constitute a close family relationship. Mooppan conceded that people can have a profound connection to their grandparents and other extended relatives, but from a legal perspective, the administration had to draw the line somewhere to have a workable ban based largely on definitions used in other aspects of immigration law, he said. Hawaii is also one of 15 states that sued the Trump administration Wednesday over its plans to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that protects young immigrants from deportation. “Today’s decision by the 9th Circuit keeps families together. It gives vetted refugees a second chance,” state Attorney General Douglas Chin said in a statement. “The Trump administration keeps taking actions with no legal basis. We will keep fighting back.”

7 Cosmic Phenomena Physicists Might 'Hear' in Gravitational Waves  [SEP]  For the third time in two years, physicists have detected ripples in the fabric of spacetime, called gravitational waves, that Albert Einstein predicted the existence of more than 100 years ago with his theory of general relativity. "Einstein continues to rock, in the sense that we keep pushing the boundaries of his theory," Vicky Kalogera, an astrophysicist at Northwestern University and LIGO data analyst, told Business Insider. "It passes every test that we throw at it." The waves came from two black holes colliding together about 3 billion light-years from Earth, and a giant experiment called LIGO detected them. But that's just one of many discoveries that gravitational waves could bring us as new detectors go online and get upgraded. This article was originally published by Business Insider.
Opinion | Fixing the opioid crisis may mean more pain for my patients  [SEP]  Most Americans understand, at least in part, how bad the opioid crisis has gotten. But, to review: In 2015 alone, opioid overdoses claimed more than 42,000 lives in America, which is more than 500 percent increase over the number of opioid-related deaths in 1999. Even more troubling, 75 percent of people who abuse heroin now say they got their start abusing prescription drugs. Studies show that over 50% of people who abused prescription painkillers got them from friends or relatives for free; 25% of them received it from a doctor. As a surgeon-in-training who constantly prescribes both inpatient and outpatient pain killers, these figures are more than just a little alarming. And after a long day, I’ve often found myself asking the sobering question: Am I contributing to the opioid epidemic? In part because of my own concerns, in my department at Duke University Hospital, I was recently tasked with developing a new pain protocol to try and standardize our post-operative pain regimen in order to limit the amount of narcotics given to patients. The overarching goal is simple: To only give opioids to those who really need them, in as sparing an amount as possible. But even with the opioid epidemic splashed across media headlines nationwide, this mission has proven to be far more difficult than most might imagine, and it has even made me very unpopular among some of the staff and doctors of my own hospital. The problem, of course, is that, in many ways, it is so much easier to over-medicate patients, especially those who struggle with pain that can interfere with emotional and physical recovery. Giving patients what they want for pain makes for a much more enjoyable hospital stay for them, and an easier patient for us to take care of. But when I examined the available research on opioid-related deaths and addiction, it became clear that despite the extra discomfort some might feel, in the end, many patients are better off without opioids, even if it means more discomfort. For interventionalists and surgeons, appropriately and effectively managing postoperative pain has always been a challenge. None of us joined this profession to hurt people, and it feels natural to treat the pain that we see in front of us each day as aggressively as possible. Many of my patients have cancer, deformities, infection and/or other pathologies that violate tissue and destroy anatomy. We see patients suffering, and our reflex as doctors is to help them. Unfortunately, treating pain often has its own complications. For instance, studies have consistently shown that opioid use in the hospital is often associated with an increase in inpatient mortality and aggregate morbidity, including respiratory failure, surgical site infection, mechanical ventilation, pneumonia, myocardial infarction, and postoperative ileus (when your intestines stop contracting), as well as prolonged hospital stays and non-routine discharges. In other words, giving a patient opioids to treat post-operative pain can make them sicker. And in April 2017, researchers at the University of Michigan released the results of a population-based study of 36,177 surgical patients which found that there is a small but significant proportion of patients who develop new and persistent opioid use, beyond what is to be expected for pain relief, after both major and minor elective surgeries. They called persistent prescription opioid use "one of the most common complications after elective surgery." These findings have been replicated in other studies, and in many different surgical fields, too. What can health care providers do to address these problems? For one, we should look abroad. In numerous other countries, opioid use is much lower than it is in the United States, even though the physicians there do many of the same surgeries. This is likely because patients receive far, far fewer opioid medications in and out of the hospital, due to costs, availability and doctor preferences. I’m sure that some patients have a more painful experience in those countries than they would here, but in the big picture, and, as difficult as it is to practice, maybe a little more discomfort is what some of our patients need to spare them some of the widely-recognized complications of opioid-based pain management. This is not to say that patients should be left writhing in pain in their hospital beds: We need to start using a multi-disciplinary and multi-modal approach to pain management. Surgeons need to engage in early education with their patients about post-operative pain management and the risks of medications, as well as setting realistic expectations about what post-surgery pain will be like. Additionally, health care providers need to identify those most vulnerable to opioid addiction, including those with mental health issues or pre-existing substance abuse, and establish more sensitive processes that ensure they experience as little pain as possible without relying on potentially dangerous opioids. We also need to rely more heavily on other medications in our arsenal, such as acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, muscles relaxants and nerve agents. And health care providers need to be innovative and creative and find different ways to implement pain medication delivery, using methods like steroid injections and epidural catheters. Providers must also work harder to encourage those who do develop addictions to enlist in rehabilitation, and they should involve more frequently other specialists in crafting and carrying out treatment plans, especially pain management doctors and psychologists. Most importantly, all providers need to look in the mirror and ask themselves if we are being good stewards of prescribing practices, or if we are part of the problem we see in the news.

South, North Korea remove propaganda loudspeakers as ties thaw  [SEP]  North and South Korea have begun removing loudspeakers used to broadcast competing propaganda messages across its shared border, as ties between the rival states continue to warm up following a breakthrough meeting of their leaders late last month. South Korean defence ministry personnel on Tuesday started to remove the loudspeakers installed in the front line of Paju in front of journalists - the first action Seoul has taken following the historic meeting on April 27. The defence ministry also told the South Korean news agency, Yonhap, that its North Korean counterpart had also begun dismantling its loudspeakers on the other side of the border earlier in the day It did not say how long it will take to dismantle the loudspeakers installed in at least 40 locations along the border. For years, South Korea has been using sound equipment to broadcast anti-Pyongyang messages. South Korea's use of the loudspeakers became a source of irritation in the past, with North Korea threatening artillery strikes against the equipment unless they were switched off. At some point during decades of the military face-off between the rival Koreas, the speakers were either turned off or removed as their ties improved, only to be turned on again as relations became sour. Messages included a criticism of North Korea's communist system, news on South Korea and even K-pop music. But South Korea switched it off anew before the meeting between South Korea's President Moon Jae-in and the North's Kim Jong-un. During the meeting between the two leaders, they agreed to stop hostile acts and committed to begin talks on denuclearisation and ending the Korea War. Aside from using loudspeakers, South Korea also distributed anti-Pyongyang leaflets using balloons in the past. The unification ministry, which oversees inter-Korean relations, has pleaded for cooperation on the implementation of the commitments during the summit. In the past, opponents of talks with North Korea, including dissidents and defectors, had tried to distribute messages across the border against Pyongyang. "The suspension of scattering leaflets is of importance not only in easing military tensions but also protecting the security and safety of residents in border areas and preventing social conflicts," Yonhap news quoted a ministry spokesman as saying. Meanwhile, talks continue between the Koreas and the United States as to the venue of the expected meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim later this month or early in June. On Monday, Trump suggested on social media that the demilitarised zone at Panmunjom between the two Koreas would be "more representative, important and lasting site" than a third country for his meeting with Kim. Singapore is also in contention as a venue for the meeting, as it presents itself as a neutral option, with the city-state having a long-standing relationship with the US and also diplomatic ties with Pyongyang. Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, has also been suggested as a possible venue, as well as Geneva in Switzerland, the venue of many peace talks.
Ana Ivanovic announces her retirement from tennis  [SEP]  Ana Ivanovic, the former world No1 and French Open champion, has retired from tennis at the age of 29, the Serb confirmed on Wednesday. “There is no other way to say this. I have decided to retire from professional tennis. It was a difficult decision but there is so much to celebrate,” Ivanovic said on her Facebook page. “Don’t be sad, be optimistic alongside me. My love and my greatest thank you to all of you.” Ivanovic reached world No1 shortly after winning the French Open in 2008. She held the post for nine weeks and never reached those heights again, dropping to 63rd in the rankings. Ivanovic did reach the semi-finals of the French Open in 2015, sparking hope of a revival, but she has now decided to call it a day.
Senators back martial law  [SEP]  MEMBERS of the Senate majority bloc have expressed their support to Proclamation 216 declaring martial law and suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in Mindanao. Apart from supporting the declaration of martial law by President Rodrigo Duterte, the 15 senators who filed Senate Resolution 388 also found no cause to revoke the same. The resolution was filed on May 29, 2017, the same day security officials briefed senators on the situation in Mindanao. The senators were convinced that the declaration was warranted based on the report submitted by the office of the President. Malacañang in its report cited the series of violent acts committed by the Maute terrorist group that resulted in the killing and wounding of soldiers and the mass jailbreak in Marawi City. Senators who signed the resolution include Senate President Aquilino Pimentel 3rd, Senate majority leader Vicente Sotto 3rd, Senate President pro tempore Ralph Recto, and Senators Juan Edgardo “Sonny” Angara, Nancy Binay, Joseph Victor “JV” Ejercito, Sherwin “Win” Gatchalian, Richard Gordon, Grogorio Honasan, Panfilo Lacson, Loren Legarda, Manny Pacquiao, Joel Villanueva, Cynthia Villar and Juan Miguel Zubiri. The senate minority bloc on Monday filed a resolution asking congress to convene in a joint session and deliberate on Proclamation 216. Jefferson Antiporda
Army Secretary Nominee Withdraws Amid Fierce Opposition  [SEP]  WASHINGTON -- The Republican state senator from Tennessee picked by President Donald Trump to be Army secretary has withdrawn from consideration. Mark Green quickly saw opposition from Democrats who became worried his personal views wouldn't bode well for soldiers or potential recruits. A few Republicans, such as Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, also noted their concern. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, said in a statement that had Green been confirmed, it "would send the wrong message to brave and selfless Americans who simply wish to serve their nation." Duckworth, who was an Army National Guard Black Hawk pilot, lost both legs in a crash in Iraq. Sources first told CNN earlier this week Green would likely withdraw his name. He is the second Trump nominee for Army secretary to withdraw. During the review process, the decorated West Point graduate came under fire for past unfavorable comments about the LGBTQ community as well as Muslims. Several Democrats have denounced Green for declaring that being transgender is a disease. He is opposed to gay marriage. Green said in a statement that "false and misleading attacks" against him have made his nomination a distraction. He said his life of public service and Christian beliefs have been mischaracterized for political gain. During a speech last September, Green urged that a stand be taken against "the indoctrination of Islam" in public schools. He also referred to the "Muslim horde" that invaded Constantinople centuries ago. Trump's first Army secretary nominee, Vincent Viola, and Navy secretary nominee Philip Bilden in February withdrew from consideration, citing business and financial concerns. Meanwhile, the president's pick to be the next secretary of the Air Force will head to a Senate floor vote next week. The chamber is expected to vote on Heather Wilson, a former congresswoman and Air Force Academy graduate, on Monday. -- The Associated Press contributed to this story. -- Oriana Pawlyk can be reached at oriana.pawlyk@military.com.

Muhammadu Buhari and Donald Trump in Nigeria-US Relations: A Prolegomena to their April 30 Meeting  [SEP]  Many factors defined Nigeria’s relationships with the United States before the advent of Muhammadu Buhari and Donald Trump as elected presidents of Nigeria and the United States. The factors included trade, especially crude oil; African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA); multi-party democracy; presidential system of government; regional security cooperation; dependency syndrome; and development assistance. Speaking generally, Nigeria’s relationship with the United States is warm but characterised by mutual suspicions. These mutual suspicions have been heightened under President Muhammadu Buhari (PMB) and President Donald Trump, who both constitute new and special dynamics in Nigeria-United States. In this regard, how do they impact on the bilateral ties between their two countries? What are the two presidents likely to discuss at the meeting scheduled for April 30, 2018 in Washington? As revealed by Sarah Sanders, the spokesperson of the White House on Sunday 15th April, 2018, ‘President Trump looks forward to discussing ways to enhance our strategic partnership and advance our shared priorities,’ that is, ‘promoting economic growth and reforms, fighting terrorism and other threats to peace and security, and building on Nigeria’s role as a democratic leader in the region.’ Additionally, the United States believes that if there is security and economic growth in Nigeria, as well as leadership in Africa, the strong and deep relationship between the United States and Nigeria ‘will advance our mutual prosperity.’ From the statement of Sarah Sanders, there is no disputing the fact that greater emphasis is much likely to be placed on how to better conduct the war on terror, how to consolidate democratic values, and how to foster better economic ties. In light of this expectation, what is the likely impact of the would-be meeting? Will it really lead to improvement in bilateral understanding? Vie Internationale believes, and strongly too, that not much would change following the scheduled meeting for various reasons: the main dynamics of Nigeria-US relations are constant until now and they are much likely to remain so for a long time to come. The main dynamic is competing sovereign equality and mutual suspicion, largely predicated on vertical dependence. Secondly, the domestic perception of the two leaders cannot be helpful to the development of better understanding. While Donald Trump’s attitudinal disposition to the maintenance of multilateral diplomacy, global peace and security is nothing to write home about, President Buhari is being accused of selective-driven anti-corruption war, nepotism, and ill health. Donald Trump is promoting national protectionism to the detriment of protection of collective interest, while Muhammadu Buhari is seriously challenged by deepening threats to Nigeria’s survival. The mania of foreign policy management under Donald Trump is another problem entirely: it is without extension of diplomatic courtesies to other sovereign leaders, but with use of arrogant foul language. In the eyes of Donald Trump, other elected presidents can be talked to, and not necessarily talked with. Donald Trump addresses the Nigerian leader as a sub-president, and this has precisely been a major dynamic of the relationship between Donald Trump and Muhammadu Buhari in their individual capacities as leaders of their two countries. In fact, how does Donald Trump see Nigeria and PMB? How does the perception affect or likely to affect Nigeria-US relationship in the foreseeable future? In responding to the foregoing questions, it is useful to explicate the current situational reality of the relationship, and then put the challenges of mutual perception in it with the ultimate objective of articulating the possible direction of the relationship. Nigeria-US Relationship under Trump United States foreign policy under President Donald Trump is largely predicated on the principle of ‘America First’ within the framework of global concentricism. In the possible thinking of President Trump, there is no need differentiating between or among many foreign policy concentric circles. At best, we can talk about two, inner and outer circles. In this regard, the inner circle is America or the United States, while the outer circle is the rest of the world. Unlike in Nigeria where Professor Ibrahim Gambari talks about geo-political foreign policy concentricism and Ambassador Oluyemi Adeniji also talks about beneficial and constructive concentricism, both of whom talk about prioritisation of concentric circles and the protection of the national interest in each concentric circle, President Trump only has one priority, and that is ‘anything American’, that is, anything with American character, and anything considered to be American. The principle of ‘American First’ is not at all different from Ambassador Adeniji’s beneficial and constructive concentricism: he agrees with Professor Gambari that there is goodness in prioritising Nigeria’s foreign policy areas, but also adds that the goodness will be more if Nigeria’s national interest is first articulated within each prioritised concentric circle. When compared to Donald Trump’s ‘America First,’ the whole world is one concentric circle, meaning that Donald Trump is talking about ‘global-centricism’ as the epicentre of US foreign policy. The immediate implication of this for the tête-à-tête between Trump and Buhari scheduled for April 30 is to expect the rigid application of the principle of ‘America First’ at the various levels of the bilateral talks. Explained in other words, President Trump should not be expected to negotiate away any US interest, implying that Nigeria has been boxed to the corner before negotiations even begin. But put interrogatively, has Nigeria any policy or principle of ‘Nigeria First’ to serve as a counter-philosophy? Where Nigeria’s national interest conflicts with that of the United States, what are the likely bargaining factors on which Nigeria can capitalise during such bilateral talks? Secondly, the visit of Rex Tillerson, former US Secretary of State to Africa also raises questions about Donald Trump’s attitude towards Africa. Tillerson made a tour of some African countries with the ultimate objective of helping to build a new and better image for Donald Trump in Africa. His visit to Nigeria was the last in the series. It was quite brief as Tillerson had to rush back home to be sacked as Secretary of State. Why was his sack immediately following his visit to Nigeria? True, Donald Trump had, before then, told all Americans, particularly his close collaborators, not to abuse or condemn Russia on any matter. Tillerson was on record to have breached this directive. Was this the factor that explains his sack? Was there anything Tillerson did during his short stay in Nigeria that infuriated Donald Trump? It is our belief that, contrary to popular diplomatic belief, Nigeria’s relationship with the United States under president Donald Trump and President Buhari is neither warm nor deep. Before the advent of the two leaders, the relationship was fairly warm in attitudinal disposition and deep in scope of areas of cooperation. Beyond that, the relationship has been that of crises and conflicts. Third, on the basis of Trump’s animosity vis-a-vis Buhari, the 2019 re-election agenda of PMB may not be ruled out in the expected tête-à-tête on April 30. In other words, does Donald Trump really want PMB re-elected? Why would Muhammadu Buhari be invited to Washington only to be told not to contest? Why should it be the responsibility of Donald Trump to encourage Buhari to contest? Article 2:7 of the UN Charter prohibits unnecessary interference and intervention in the domestic affairs of other sovereign states, meaning that the re-election of Buhari should not be a major preoccupation of the United States. However, is US interference preventable if the issue of democracy comes up? Is it preventable when the questions of corruption and Chibok or Dapchi girls are raised? Is it preventable in light of the allegation by former Minister of Defence, Lt-General Theophilus Danjuma, an allegation of ethnic cleansing by the Nigerian military, and his advice that Nigerians now owe it a responsibility to defend themselves? As General Danjuma put it when he noted on Saturday, March 24, 2018 at the inaugural convocation of the Taraba State University, ‘there is an attempt at ethnic cleansing in the state, and, of course, some rural states in Nigeria. We must resist it. We must stop it. Everyone of us rise up.’ More important, General Danjuma observed that ‘our armed forces are not neutral. They collude with the bandits to kill people, kill Nigerians. The armed forces guide their movements; they cover them. If you are depending on the Armed Forces to stop the killings, you will all die one by one.’ Consequently, he advised everyone ‘to be alert and defend your country (Nigeria), defend your territory and defend your state because you have no other place to go.’ With this public statement, which has been widely reported and which, without jot of doubt, would have been duly reported by all accredited diplomatic missions to Nigeria back home, PMB must prepare more cautiously for the response, even if it is not directly raised by Donald Trump. The important implication of the observation is that it has been raised by a Nigerian with credibility and integrity, an altruist and patriot, Theophilus Danjuma, and not by a foreigner. And perhaps more disturbingly, PMB will need to also prepare for another allegation by the Taraba State Government that it informed the Federal Government about the security threats and the soldiers’ misconduct, but the Federal Government opted to keep silent about it. This is an allegation that may not be separated from that of General Danjuma. Both allegations are issues any US president would want to be interested in. Fourth, there is the issue of alleged support of Donald trump for the proponents of a sovereign state of Biafra. The MASSOB (Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra) and the IPOB (Indigenous People of Biafra) expressed open support for Donald Trump’s election, reportedly because of his sympathy for oppressed people. On which side is the United States in matters of national unity, national restructuring? Without doubt, Buhari is more experienced as a statesman and president, having been a military head of state and also an elected president. However, Buhari cannot be said to have the exposure of the president of a superpower with all the attendant political intrigues involved in it. President Buhari will need to factor into his discussions the physiognomic factors. In many developed democracies, physiognomy is taken seriously. In Nigeria, it is not a big deal most unfortunately. Fifthly, one of the foreign policy objectives of Nigeria is the respect for international treaties and other agreements. This is consistent with the principle of sanctity of agreements or pacta sunt servanda. The principle does not any longer mean anything to Donald trump as he has been reneging on many of US obligations on the basis of ‘America First.’ To what extent will PMB be able to also behave irrationally like Donald Trump? What the United States is basically interested in is consolidation of democratic values, regional peace and security, conducive business environment, and, of course, a Nigeria that will not become a challenge to US foreign policy interests in international relations. In other words, the goodness in, and development of, the bilateral ties must not be to the extent of enabling Nigeria to be strong enough to be able to effectively challenge the directives or positions of the United States in inter-state relations. This is true of the foreign policy interest of the great powers. No country wants any other country that will be able to challenge it. In fact, this is why admission of new members into the UN Security Council has not been favourably entertained. In the same vein, the current political challenge with which the whole of the European Union countries are faced is the new and more militant Russia, which has reportedly been undermining European strategic interests. Thus, the new strength of Russia and the technological capacity with which it is springing surprises is the main issue now. Mutual Perceptions The perception in Nigeria of the people of the United States is mixed. Americans are considered great and a role model, especially in light of their principle of protection of the citizen of America in all circumstances. The technological feat and industrial development is seen to be a major source of sweet inspirations. On the other hand, many Nigerians also see Americans to be very arrogant and their government carry this arrogance to the international arena, to the extent that they are no longer able to see any limitations in the conduct and management of their foreign policy outside America. In fact, whatever the United States does is regarded always correct. When another country does exactly the same, it is presented as a breach of international civilisation, if not an abuse of international fundamental rights. It is from this perspective that Donald Trump’s foreign policy pronouncements should be seen and explained. Ever before Donald Trump took over the mantle of leadership of the United States, Nigeria’s PMB was never in the good books of the US leader. For instance, as presidential candidate, Donald Trump not only criticised PMB of coming up with a negative and painful change, arguing that what PMB had done was to be sponsoring Islamic agenda, but also said that PMB’s victory was questionable. In fact, in the eyes of Donald Trump, PMB is, at best, irresponsible. As Donald Trump put it, ‘no sensible president continuously travels round the globe while his country is in terrible hardship and economic mess. It can only happen in Nigeria where all that matters to the president is the full introduction of Islam, annihilation of his political opponents and absolute extermination of the people of the old Eastern Nigeria.’ Additionally, Donald Trump accused PMB of making lots of promises at the polls which he has ‘obviously failed to keep, and, in most cases, denied…. It wouldn’t be wrong to assert that what PMB promised as change is negative.’ Apart from the presidential dimension, the perception of the people of Nigeria and their leaders is equally noteworthy. At a rally held in Wichita, Kansas, United States, President Trump opined that ‘Nigerians and Mexicans have taken all the jobs meant for honest, hard working Americans… Why can’t they stay in their own country? Why? Donald Trump provided one possible answer: ‘because they are corrupt. Their governments are so corrupt. They rob the people blind and bring it all here to spend and their people run away and come down here and take our jobs. We need to get the Africans out. Not the blacks, the Africans. Especially the Nigerians. They are everywhere. We can’t have that. If I become president, we’ll send them all home. We’ll build a wall at the Atlantic shore.’ And perhaps most interestingly, Donald Trump was able to note that, when he went for a rally in Alaska, he met ‘just one African in the entire state. ‘Where was he born?’ he asked and the answer is Nigeria. As submitted by Trump, ‘he is in Alaska taking our jobs. they are in Houston taking our jobs.’ Thus, in the eyes of Donald Trump, Nigerians are not only corrupt but also constitute an economic burden, who should be declared persons non-gratae if elected the US President. And true enough, he has been elected and has been trying tooth and nail to get his racist policy of national development implemented. However, the polity has not been quite favourable but there is no disputing the fact that he nurses unlimited animosity vis-a-vis Africans in the US. This point should be specially noted because he distinguishes between the blacks and Africans. Now that Donald Trump has been elected, to deport Africans or Nigerians in particular is a matter of time if Donald Trump is not impeached. If the polity places barriers that have hitherto prevented him from acting, it is important to note that Donald Trump is only tolerating Africans in his country. It is against this background that Nigeria’s PMB has been invited to pay official visit to Washington to discuss the modalities for further improvement in the relationship. Nigeria’s delegation to the US must therefore plan well and provide answers well in advance to Donald Trump’s ‘America First.’
Sweden identifies truck attack suspect as 39-year-old Uzbekistan native | Toronto Star  [SEP]  STOCKHOLM—The suspect in Stockholm’s deadly beer truck attack is a 39-year-old native of Uzbekistan who had been on authorities’ radar previously, Swedish officials said Saturday. The prime minister urged citizens to “get through this” and strolled through the streets of the capital to chat with residents. Swedes flew flags at half-staff Saturday to commemorate the four people killed and 15 wounded when the hijacked truck plowed into a crowd of shoppers Friday afternoon in Stockholm. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven declared Monday a national day of mourning, with a minute of silence at noon. Sweden’s police chief said authorities were confident they had detained the man who carried out the attack. “There is nothing that tells us that we have the wrong person,” Dan Eliason told a news conference Saturday, but added he did not know whether others were involved in the attack. “We cannot exclude this.” Read more: Swedish PM calls deadly truck attack an ‘act of terror,’ police make one arrest Prosecutor Hans Ihrman said the suspect has not yet spoken to authorities and could not confirm whether he was a legal resident of Sweden. Anders Thornberg, head of the Swedish Security Service, said security services were working with other nations’ security agencies to investigate the attack, but declined to elaborate. Police conducted overnight raids around Stockholm but declined to say if they were hunting any more suspects in the case. They said they have been questioning people in connection with the case but no one else has been detained. They said the suspect had been on their radar before but not recently, and did not explain why authorities apparently had not considered him a serious threat. Eliason told reporters the suspect was “a more marginal character.” Sweden’s health service said 10 people were still hospitalized for wounds from the attack and four of them were seriously injured. Hundreds of people gathered at the site of the crash Saturday afternoon, building a wall of colourful flowers on the aluminum fences to keep the people away from the broken glass and twisted metal. Some hugged police officers near the crash site. Visiting the attack site, Sweden’s Crown Princess Victoria laid roses on the ground Saturday and wiped away a tear. “We must show a huge force, we must go against this,” she told reporters. Many in Sweden were shocked by the attack, questioning whether Swedish society — considered democratic and egalitarian — had failed in some way. Although it was not clear how long the suspect had been in Sweden, the Scandinavian country prides itself on welcoming newcomers. Still the country’s open-door immigration policy and comparatively heterogeneous culture has led to frictions, sometimes urban unrest, especially in areas where many long-time immigrants feel disempowered. In 2015, Sweden received a record 163,000 asylum-seekers. That was the highest per-capita rate in Europe, and the country’s has since reduced the number of refugees and migrants it will accept. The stolen beer truck travelled for more than 500 meters along Drottninggatan, a main pedestrian street, before smashing into a crowd outside the popular Ahlens department store. The crash was near the site of a December 2010 attack in which Taimour Abdulwahab, a Swedish citizen who lived in Britain, detonated a suicide bomb, killing himself and injuring two others. Steve Eklund, 35, who works in an office nearby, said “maniacs can’t be stopped.” “It’s very simple. Things like this will always happen in an open society,” Eklund said. “Sweden is not a totalitarian society.” In February, U.S. President Donald Trump suggested that Sweden could be the next European country to suffer the kind of extremist attacks that have devastated France, Belgium and Germany. Two days after his remarks, a riot broke out in predominantly immigrant suburb of Stockholm where police opened fire on rioters, a surprise to many Swedes who aren’t used to officers using guns. Lofven, Interior Minister Anders Ygeman and other government members have praised the police and the emergency services for their swift response to the attack. “We must get through this. Life must go on,” Lofven said Saturday after again laying flowers near the crash site. “We in Sweden want an open society.” Lofven also made a point of walking around Stockholm, including along Drottninggatan, chatting with people having coffee outside a cafe. The prime minister said the aim of terrorism is to undermine democracy. “But such a goal will never be achieved in Sweden,” he said.
Thursday briefing: BT hangs up on Huawei as CFO is arrested  [SEP]  Hello, Warren Murray here tapping the rich seam of Thursday’s news. BT has confirmed it is removing equipment supplied by Huawei from key areas of its 4G network after the head of MI6 raised concerns. Meanwhile Canada has arrested the Chinese company’s chief financial officer for sanctions violations. The CFO arrested in Canada is Meng Wanzhou, daughter of company founder Ren Zhengfei. US authorities are understood to have been investigating Huawei since 2016 for allegedly shipping US-origin products to Iran and other countries in violation of export restrictions. This week the head of MI6 suggested the UK needed to decide if it was “comfortable” with Chinese ownership of the technology being used. Governments in the US, New Zealand and Australia have moved to block the use of Huawei’s equipment as part of their 5G rollout. Zhengfei is a former officer in the People’s Liberation Army. A recent report to the US congress said the Chinese government could force suppliers and manufacturers to manipulate their products for “state or corporate espionage”. Huawei denies any improper links to the Chinese government. ‘Taking a hammering!’ – Efforts are under way to rescue a British solo yachtswoman who narrowly survived a violent storm in the Southern Ocean. Susie Goodall, 29, is the youngest competitor and only woman in the 30,000-mile Golden Globe round-the-world race. Her yacht, DHL Starlight, was rolled end over end and and lost its mast on Wednesday night UK time. “I was thrown across the cabin and knocked out for a while,” she told race HQ by satellite phone. “The boat is destroyed. I can’t make up a jury rig. The only thing left is the hull and deck which remain intact.” She was left “beaten up and badly bruised” with cuts and scratches and had a big bump on her head. Race organisers say they are working with other competitors and Chilean authorities have alerted shipping but reaching her position could take several days. Lock, backstop and PM over barrel – Theresa May has offered a “parliamentary lock” on the Brexit backstop after legal advice warned her proposed deal could leave the UK trapped in “protracted and repeated rounds of negotiations” for years to come. The lock would give MPs a vote before the backstop could be invoked. Hard Brexiters have dismissed the proposal. The Unite union leader, Len McCluskey, has privately told Labour MPs that trying to get another referendum could be seen as a betrayal by voters who want curbs on immigration and the use of immigrant labour. Amid continuing debate in the Commons, Sam Gyimah, who resigned as a junior education minister last week, explained why he could not support the deal with an analogy that fell at the final hurdle. “This is like shoes that have holes in the soles: this deal is fatally flawed.” Golden visa rules tightened – The foreign super-rich are to face new restrictions on buying their way into the UK as part of attempts to tackle money laundering and organised crime. From next year, applicants for the tier 1 “golden visa” scheme must show the money trail behind the £2m in investment funds that they are required to put up. They will no longer be able to invest in government bonds as part of the reforms, and must invest in active and trading UK companies. The scheme has been suspended until the new rules are put in place. Golden visas have been criticised for providing an easy route into the UK for individuals looking to launder stolen wealth. In the year ending September 2018 more than 1,000 such visas were granted. Gilets jaunes win fuel battle – Amid continued unrest in France, Emmanuel Macron has gone from postponing a fuel tax rise to scrapping it altogether. Macron is refusing, though, to reintroduce the wealth tax that he repealed in a move that led to his nickname, “president of the rich”. France’s main unions are planning a joint meeting today and there are threats of a weekend hauliers’ strike. Various gilets jaunes organisers have called for wider social reforms including a higher minimum wage and higher taxes on the likes of Google and Amazon. High school students are protesting against plans to toughen university entrance criteria. In the Assemblée National, government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux told MPs: “Emmanuel Macron asks all the political and union organisations as well as business leaders to issue a clear and explicit appeal for calm … What we are living through is no longer political opposition, but opposition to the republic.” ‘Holding Mom’s hand again’ – George HW Bush has been farewelled at a Washington state funeral where the former president was tearfully remembered as “the best father a son or daughter could have”, by the son who held the same office. In a separate eulogy, historian Jon Meacham, who wrote a definitive biography of Bush, described him as “America’s last great soldier-statesman” who “stood in the breach in Washington against unthinking partisanship.” He added: “An imperfect man, he left us a more perfect union.” There were weird vibes when Donald and Melania Trump arrived – the incumbent president exchanged greetings with the Obamas but not the Clintons. The state funeral’s 3,000 invited guests included Prince Charles and leaders of Germany, Jordan, Australia and Poland, along with a host of former world leaders, such as former British prime minister John Major, who was in office during Bush’s single 1989-1993 term. Bush’s remains later arrived at a Houston church, where he was to lie in repose overnight before further services and his final burial beside wife Barbara and their daughter Robin who died of leukemia in 1953 at age three. Stonehenge tunnel damage claim – Angry archaeologists have accused engineers of digging a three-metre-deep hole through a manmade platform of flint and animal bone near the Stonehenge site. The 6,000-year-old platform at Blick Mead preserves the hoof prints of aurochs – giant prehistoric cattle that are now extinct. “This is a travesty,” said Prof David Jacques from the University of Buckingham. “We believe hunters considered this area to be a sacred place even before Stonehenge. These monster cows – double the size of normal cattle – provided food for 300 people, so were revered … If the remains aren’t preserved we may never be able to understand why Stonehenge was built.” A Highways England spokesperson said it was not aware of any damage but would be meeting Jacques at the site on Thursday.

This “holy bone” connects the backbone to the hip bone. “It lies at our middle. If we are wheels, the sacrum is our hub. All roads lead to it; everything flows from it. Without it, that small, hand-sized bone, we can’t move … Some injuries are life-changing, the doctor said, and so I have duly changed my life.

Emmanuel Macron: Academic blasts 'liberal hysteria' and warns of Marine Le Pen resurgence  [SEP]  Professor Anand Menon, the director of research initiative UK in a Changing Europe, warned Marine Le Pen would “be back in 2022” if the French President fails to reform France and build its economy. The academic, of King’s College London, outlined the series of events which allowed the politician to return victorious. He told the Express.co.uk: “The thing about Macron and his election is that it has been greeted with this kind of liberal hysteria. And you know, I share the delight that he beat Marine Le Pen but I think it’s a little preemptive. “I think it’s preemptive for a lot of reasons – one, Macron won in part because this was a unique election. “It was an election in which you have the most unpopular President ever in France not standing for the socialist party and you have the right-wing candidate who was the favourite to win the election being wrecked by a personal finances scandal. “And it’s only because of that that Macron finally came through to win.” Professor Menon said Ms Le Pen should not be written off just yet. He said: “Remember, Marine Le Pen got 11million votes, 11m votes for the far-right. “And National Front planners have long said privately this isn’t the election they thought they would win, they’ve got their eyes set on 2022. “So if you think ahead to 2022, if Macron doesn’t manage to reform France, if he doesn’t manage to get the economy growing again, then actually, she’ll be back in 2022 and so I think it’s too early to definitely pop the champagne.” Professor Menon remained “sceptical” as to whether President Macron could reform the trading bloc and the eurozone. He said: “Macron can’t reform the EU because you need the agreement of 27 governments to reform the EU and it strikes me that those governments are so divided that there is no way you can get a treaty change which would be approved by all the member states. “He’s talked a good game about what we need to do to make the eurozone stronger, I am very very sceptical as to whether he can actually implement that.” And speaking about his stance on Brexit, the expert warned the UK would now not receive “any special treatment”. “He was the most EU friendly of the candidates in the French election and that means for him, the crucial thing is being a non-member has got to look worse than being a member,” he said. “So he will insist that the EU applies the rules and that we don’t get any special treatment and we can’t cherry-pick bits of the single market.”

Tempers fray as search for survivors winds down after Mexico quake  [SEP]  MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Tempers frayed in Mexico City on Friday as the search for survivors amidst twisted rubble of collapsed buildings began to wind down three days after the country’s most deadly earthquake in a generation. The 7.1 magnitude quake leveled 52 buildings in the sprawling Mexican capital at lunchtime on Tuesday, leaving thousands homeless and close to 300 people dead. Apartment blocks, offices, a school and a textile factory were among the structures that were destroyed. Across the city, thousands of rescue workers and special teams using sniffer dogs and heat sensors combed wreckage, while the massive outpouring of support from volunteers sparked global praise for Mexico’s spirit. Efforts were not fast enough, though, for some family members waiting outside an office building that collapsed in the fashionable Roma neighborhood. As storm clouds gathered over the city, families worried that rain could slow the pace of rescue efforts. Protesters held signs addressed to President Enrique Pena Nieto and Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera. “Mancera and EPN: We demand results” read one sign. “They are still alive. Don’t kill them” and “We don’t want machines” read others, referring to rumors that the military would use bulldozers to hasten removal of rubble deemed unlikely to harbor survivors. Many sites had already been cleared of rubble by Friday afternoon and chances were dimming of finding anyone else alive. U.S. rescue workers went to work Friday in the collapsed office building, looking for six people who were still missing. Mexican soldiers and volunteers, supported by teams from as far afield as Israel and Japan, have so far rescued at least 60 people from the ruins in Mexico City and surrounding towns. For many the search was highly personal. Firefighter Teresa Ramirez Flores, 40, was helping search an office building in Mexico City’s Roma neighborhood where her cousin Carolina Muniz, a 43-year-old accountant, was on the second floor when the building collapsed. “We want to be superheroes so that our country doesn’t suffer,” she said at a site where volunteers brought a wheelbarrow filled with candy for the rescue teams. After three days though, rescuers were finding more dead bodies than survivors and frustration was increasingly evident. Luis Ruiz, a 39-year old carpenter, complained that the police would not let him enter the ruins where his sister and two of her children were buried in the rubble. “I felt powerless to be unable to get my family, unable to do anything,” he said. HOMELESS, FORGOTTEN Across the city of 20 million people, many whose dwellings had become uninhabitable sought a place to call home, raising the specter of a housing shortage. Senior officials said there could be 20,000 badly damaged homes in the states of Morelos and Puebla. Julia Juarez, 56, sat in a park where the homeless set up tents. “All the help we have received is from the civilian population. The government has not sent anything at all,” she said. “No food, no clothes, no water, not even an Alka-Seltzer.” Other Mexican volunteers complained of being displaced by foreign rescue workers who flew in to help. Oscar Ruiz, a firefighter from the state of Guanajuato who had raced to the capital after the quake, said he was close to a survivor under the rubble and could hear a heartbeat with a listening device when his team was pulled to make way for Israeli and Japanese teams. Members of rescue teams search for survivors in the rubble of a collapsed building after an earthquake in Mexico City, Mexico September 22, 2017. REUTERS/Henry Romero “Do you think I wanted that?” Ruiz said. It was not clear what happened after he left the site. In the hard-hit Roma neighborhood, Jorge Hernandez and a team of volunteers from Mexico City packed up to move on to isolated villages in Morelos. He said they were doing so after military commands declined their assistance. Mexico City “is over saturated with support and there are very remote communities in Morelos that have not received help. That’s why we are going there. There, they need so much help,” Hernandez said. EXHAUSTION, FRUSTRATION, BIG BLUNDER Tuesday’s massive quake struck on the anniversary of the deadly 1985 tremor that killed some 5,000 people in Mexico City. As the shock of this week began to subside, exhaustion crept in, along with growing discontent. On Thursday, Mexico’s Navy apologized for communicating incorrect information in a story about a girl supposedly trapped under a collapsed school in Mexico City. A frantic effort had been made to reach the child, dubbed Frida Sofia by local media, but it turned out that the widely-publicized story had been false, leading to anger. Francisco Ortiz questioned whether attention directed at trying to rescue the phantom girl had diverted resources from other places where they were desperately needed, like the apartment building where his sister, Maria, was trapped beneath debris. Authorities had waited until Thursday to begin searching the building. The owner, Juan Salazar, said all the renters had been accounted for before realizing that Ortiz’s sister Maria, a maid, had been washing clothes on the roof when the quake struck. Salazar said he called civil protection and also implored passing brigades of rescue workers to help, but it was two days before rescue efforts began. Slideshow (21 Images) “It was negligence. Nobody wanted to take responsibility, neither the army nor Civil Protection,” said Ortiz. On Friday afternoon, after a full day’s search, rescuers pulled Maria’s body from the rubble.

Police helicopter carrying 12 crashes in eastern Turkey: security sources  [SEP]  A Turkish police helicopter carrying 12 people crashed in the eastern province of Tunceli on Tuesday, the local governor's office said, adding that the crash may have been caused by poor weather conditions. The helicopter was carrying a judge, seven police officers, one sergeant and three crew members, the Tunceli governor's office said in a statement. Heavy fog in the region made the rescue operation difficult, Turkish media reports said.
Feds boot Tesla from investigation into fatal crash  [SEP]  DETROIT — Federal safety investigators have booted electric car maker Tesla Inc. from the group investigating a fatal crash in California that involved an SUV operating with the company’s Autopilot system. The National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday it removed Tesla as a party to the investigation after the company prematurely made information public. “Tesla violated the party agreement by releasing investigative information before it was vetted and confirmed by the NTSB,” the agency said in a statement. “Such releases of incomplete information often lead to speculation and incorrect assumptions about the probable cause of a crash.” On Thursday afternoon, Tesla issued a statement claiming that it withdrew from the agreement two days earlier after being told that it would be removed if it made additional statements before the NTSB finished its probe in the next 12 to 24 months. The company said it released information on the crash to correct “misleading” claims being made about Autopilot creating safety problems. Tesla said it would file a complaint with Congress and accused the agency of being more concerned with “press headlines” than promoting safety. Removing a party to an investigation is rare but has happened in the past, according to the agency. Companies and other organizations can become parties in a probe because they can give technical help and share sensitive information. The move means that the NTSB and Tesla will no longer share information about the March 23 crash of a Tesla Model X SUV on U.S. 101 near Mountain View in Silicon Valley. The driver, Walter Huang, 38, a software engineer for Apple, was killed in the crash. In a statement on March 30, Tesla confirmed that the semi-autonomous Autopilot system was operating at the time of the crash and seemed to blame the crash on Huang. The company said Huang didn’t have his hands on the steering wheel for six seconds before the impact and also received several warnings from the vehicle. Shortly after Tesla released the information, NTSB spokesman Christopher O’Neil said the agency was “unhappy” about the disclosure. Tesla tells drivers that its Autopilot system, which uses cameras, radar and computers to keep speed, change lanes, self-park and automatically stop vehicles, requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel in order to take control to avoid accidents. The Palo Alto, California, company said its vehicle logs showed Huang took no action to stop the Model X from crashing into a concrete lane divider. Photographs of the SUV show that the front of the vehicle was demolished; its hood was ripped off; and its front wheels were scattered on the freeway. The vehicle also caught fire, though Tesla said no one was in the vehicle when that happened. The company said the crash was made worse by a missing or damaged safety shield on the end of the lane divider that is supposed to help shield cars from any impact. The NTSB, along with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, are looking into the crash, as well as another Tesla crash in January near Los Angeles in which a Model S sedan smashed into a fire truck parked on a freeway. Tesla would not say whether the Model S in that crash was operating on Autopilot. In the crash that killed Huang, a Tesla spokeswoman would not directly answer questions about why the SUV didn’t spot the barrier and stop before the collision. The spokeswoman referred to a statement saying that Tesla owner’s manuals have warnings and notifications stating that a driver should not depend on the car’s autosteer system to pick the right driving path. It also says automatic emergency braking “is not designed to avoid a collision and is not a substitute for maintaining a safe travelling distance between you and the vehicle in front of you.” In its statement Thursday, Tesla says there is one auto death in the U.S. for every 86 million miles driven, but for Tesla vehicles, it’s only one death for every 320 million miles. The company also accused the NTSB of focusing on the “safest cars in America” while ignoring less-safe vehicles.
Trump says North Korea 'called up,' seeking talks with the United States  [SEP]  Trump has vowed not to repeat what he calls the mistakes of past administrations that negotiated with North Korea. Talks never stopped North Korea from pursuing weapons and left the United States looking weak, Trump has said. He said last year that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was wasting his time trying to open talks, but has more recently said he would consider them under the right conditions.
Holy Smokes! Israel takes step toward marijuana reforms  [SEP]  By The Associated Press JERUSALEM (AP) — Holy smokes! The Israeli government has taken a step toward decriminalizing marijuana use. Israeli media say Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet has approved a measure that would reduce penalties for possession of marijuana. If caught, smokers would pay a fine, instead of facing criminal charges. Netanyahu said ahead of Sunday’s meeting that a “new enforcement policy” should be drawn up “cautiously and in a controlled manner.” The decision does not mean that Jerusalem will now have Amsterdam-style coffee shops. The Haaretz daily said a committee would study ways to regulate the use of pot. Opposition lawmaker Tamar Zandberg told Haaretz “this is an important step, but not the end of the road. It sends a message that a million of Israelis who consume marijuana aren’t criminals.”
Trump says Pompeo en route to North Korea, cites hopes on ...  [SEP]  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump revealed on Tuesday that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on his way to Pyongyang to prepare for Trump’s summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and expressed hope that three Americans held there would soon be released. Trump said Pompeo, making his second visit to North Korea in less than six weeks, was expected to arrive “very shortly” and that the two countries had already agreed on a date and location for the unprecedented summit, though he stopped short of providing details. While Trump said it would be a “great thing” if the three American detainees were freed, Pompeo, speaking to reporters en route to Pyongyang, said he had not received a commitment for their release but hoped North Korea would “do the right thing.” Their release could signal an effort by Kim to set a more positive tone for the summit following his recent pledge to suspend missile tests and shut Pyongyang’s nuclear bomb test site. While Kim would be giving up the last of his remaining American prisoners, whom North Korea has often used in the past as bargaining chips with the United States, a release could also be aimed at pressuring Trump to make concessions of his own in his bid to get Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear arsenal, something it has not signaled a willingness to do. “Plans are being made, relationships are building,” Trump said of the planned summit during remarks at the White House that were otherwise focused on his decision to pull the United States out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. “Hopefully, a deal will happen. And with the help of China, South Korea and Japan, a future of great prosperity and security can be achieved for everyone,” Trump added. Pompeo made a secret visit to North Korea over the Easter weekend, becoming the first U.S. official known to have met Kim, to lay the groundwork for the planned summit. The meeting occurred before Pompeo’s nomination as secretary of state had been confirmed. Trump suggested that dropping out of the Iran nuclear accord, which he has frequently denounced as a bad deal for the United States, would send a “critical message” not just to Tehran but also to Pyongyang. He has demanded that North Korea agree to give up its nuclear arsenal. “The United States no longer makes empty threats. When I make promises, I keep them,” Trump said. FATE OF THREE DETAINEES IN PLAY Pompeo’s latest trip raised the prospects that the three Korean-American detainees - Kim Hak-song, Tony Kim and Kim Dong-chul - could be turned over to him. Asked whether that could happen, Trump told reporters: “We’ll all soon be finding out. We’ll soon be finding out. It would be a great thing if they are.” “We’ve been asking for the release of these detainees for 17 months,” Pompeo said. “We’ll talk about it again. It’d be a great gesture if they’d agree to do so.” Pompeo said he was hoping to finalize the agenda for the summit. He met Kim on this last trip but said he did not know exactly who he would meet this time. Pompeo said he hoped to be able to outline a set of conditions that would create the opportunity for a historic change in the security relationship with North Korea and added that sanctions would not be lifted until U.S. objectives were met. “We are not going to head down the path we headed down before,” he said. “We will not relieve sanctions until such time as we have achieved our objectives.” Pompeo’s latest visit followed talks between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in met on April 27 at the heavily fortified demilitarized zone between the countries, the first summit for the two Koreas in over a decade. The North-South summit produced dramatic images and a declaration of goodwill. But it was short on specific commitments and failed to clear up the question of whether Pyongyang is really willing to give up nuclear missiles that now threaten the United States. U.S. officials have been pressing Kim to free the three remaining American detainees as a gesture of sincerity before the summit, the first-ever meeting of sitting U.S. and North Korean leaders. Trump and Kim have exchanged insults and threats over the past year but tensions have eased in recent months. Until now, the only American released by North Korea during Trump’s presidency was Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old university student who returned to the United States in a coma last summer after 17 months of captivity and died days later. Warmbier’s death escalated U.S.-North Korea tensions, already running high at the time over Pyongyang’s stepped-up missile tests. The three still being held are Korean-American missionary Kim Dong Chul; Kim Sang-duk, who spent a month teaching at the foreign-funded Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) before he was arrested in 2017, and Kim Hak Song, who also taught at PUST.
PG&E, SoCal utility cut power over wind concerns  [SEP]  SAN FRANCISCO — Concerned about downed power lines sparking wildfires, two major California utilities took the rare step of cutting power to customers amid high winds — and another power provider was considering similar action. Pacific Gas & Electric for the first time began cutting power Sunday night to tens of thousands of customers in Northern California after the National Weather Service warned of extreme fire danger across the state due to high winds, low humidity and dry vegetation. San Diego Gas & Electric followed suit Monday, turning off power to about 360 customers in foothill areas near Cleveland National Forest, where multiple blazes have scorched large swaths of land in recent years. SDG&E has pre-emptively shut off power to customers in the past, most recently in December when 14,000 customers went without power — many for four days. Pacific Gas & Electric previously announced its plan to shut off power preemptively after authorities blamed its power lines for sparking some of California’s most destructive wildfires. The utility expects to pay billions of dollars in wildfire damages and has sought ways to limit its liability through the courts and Legislature. PG&E said about 87,000 customers had their power halted and more could be left in the dark depending on the weather. Some 60,000 customers remained without power. Schools in those affected areas canceled classes. PG&E said it expected to restore power Monday night to most customers — though some residents won’t get electricity back until Tuesday. “We know how much our customers rely on electric service, and we have made the decision to turn off power as a last resort given the extreme fire danger conditions these communities are experiencing,” PG&E spokesman Pat Hogan said. PG&E said it began notifying affected customers on Saturday about possible outages. However, many said Monday they had received little or no notice. Stewart Munnerlyn was scrambling to find generators to save $8,000 worth of ice cream at his creamery shop in Pine Grove, about 55 miles east of Sacramento. Munnerlyn said he is in Virginia visiting a sick relative and received three text messages Sunday night from PG&E saying it might cut power, but he didn’t know it actually happened until a friend called him. “They knew what they were going to do obviously,” Munnerlyn said. “We weren’t given enough notice to properly prepare.” Kevin Kathman, executive chef of wine country restaurant All Seasons in Calistoga, said $12,000 worth of food at the site would spoil if power isn’t restored soon. Instead of tossing it, he was planning to cook over a fire during a block party for the “stressed out community” that includes winery owners in the middle of grape harvest. The power went out Sunday night and Calistoga remained without electricity Monday, even though Kathman said there was no wind. “It’s a beautiful day,” he said. “We are all in disbelief that it’s not back on.” PG&E spokeswoman Melissa Subottin said power was also cut to hospitals and other medical providers that are required to have backup power sources. PG&E officials visited 4,400 medical customers in the affected areas to personally warn them of the outages, she said. The weather service predicted winds gusting to 55 mph in the Sierra foothills east of Sacramento. High winds were also expected in the state’s wine country north of San Francisco. Southern California Edison said it was considering shutting off power to an undetermined number of customers. Strong wind gusts swept across the region with the arrival of the first fall Santa Ana winds — hot, sustained gusts that blow from the desert to the ocean. A motorist in the Orange County city of Tustin was killed when a eucalyptus tree fell on her car in an apartment complex. The victim was 34. No further details were released. Southern California Edison spokesman David Song said about 32,000 of its 5 million customers were experiencing power outages, but no shutdowns had been ordered by the utility. Song said Edison was investigating the cause of those outages. Associated Press writers Jocelyn Gecker in San Francisco and Christopher Weber and John Antczak in Los Angeles contributed to this report.
The Latest: Facebook to end partnership with China's Huawei  [SEP]  The Latest: Facebook to end partnership with China's Huawei CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — The Latest on Facebook's privacy scandal (all times local): Facebook says it will end its data partnership with Huawei by the end of this week following a backlash over the Chinese phone maker's access to Facebook user data. Huawei, a company flagged by U.S. intelligence officials as a national security threat, is the latest device maker at the center of a fresh wave of allegations over Facebook's handling of private data. Facebook said earlier this week that Chinese firms Huawei, Lenovo, Oppo and TCL were among numerous handset makers that were given access to Facebook data in a "controlled" way approved by the social media giant. Huawei said Wednesday it has never collected or stored Facebook user data. Huawei spokesman Joe Kelly said in a text message that the arrangement was about making Facebook services more convenient for users. Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says he would welcome Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg testifying to an Australian parliamentary committee on the social media giant's sharing of data with Chinese phone maker Huawei. Leaders of Australia's Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security on Thursday raised the prospect of the 34-year-old being invited to explain Facebook's relationship with Huawei. Huawei, a company flagged by U.S. intelligence officials as a national security threat, says it has never collected or stored Facebook user data, after Facebook acknowledged it shared such data with Huawei and other manufacturers. It's the latest privacy gaffe for Facebook since allegations emerged in March that a Trump-affiliated political consultancy firm, Cambridge Analytica, had improperly harvested data of Facebook users in an effort to influence elections.
Pakistan declares Mumbai attacks mastermind Hafiz Saeed a terrorist  [SEP]  As India and US adopted a stern strategy against Pakistan for inaction against terror outfits on its soil, Islamabad in a surprise move banned Mumbai terror strike mastermind Hafiz Saeed’s outfit. Pakistan's President Mamnoon Hussain has signed an ordinance that brings all individuals and organisations banned by the UNO under the ambit of Anti-Terrorism Act.
Authorities: 4 inmates found dead at a South Carolina prison  [SEP]  COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Four inmates were found dead Friday morning in a dorm at one of South Carolina's maximum-security men's prisons, authorities said. The inmates were found at Kirkland Correctional Institution in the capital city, Department of Corrections Director Bryan Stirling told The Associated Press. Stirling did not say how they died. Department spokeswoman Sommer Sharpe identified the four inmates in a news release as John King, 52; Jason Kelley, 35; Jimmy Ham, 56; and William Scruggs, 44. King was serving time for a variety of crimes and had a projected release date of October 2020. Kelley was serving 15 years for assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature. He was scheduled for release in August 2020. Ham was scheduled for release this November after serving a sentence for a variety of offenses. Scruggs was sentenced to life in prison for murder and first-degree burglary. Stirling said he asked the State Law Enforcement Division to assist Corrections police with their investigation. Coroner Gary Watts confirmed he was investigating four deaths at the prison but wouldn't give any details about how the inmates died. Kirkland operates a specialized housing unit for the state's most dangerous inmates, an assessment and evaluation center for new inmates sentenced to more than three months, and a 24-bed infirmary, according to the Corrections website. The prison has been the scene of previous violence. In 2015, two inmates held two nurses hostage with homemade knives for seven hours after forcing their way into a nursing station where prescription drugs were kept. One nurse's throat was cut, but she survived. Last year, three corrections officers at Kirkland were fired after officials said they tried to kill an inmate in their care. Authorities said the officers, who were charged with attempted murder and misconduct in office, stabbed an inmate while he was handcuffed. Their cases are still pending.

Costa Concordia captain heads to prison over 2012 shipwreck | Toronto Star  [SEP]  ROME—The Italian captain of the Costa Concordia cruise liner that crashed into a reef in 2012 and capsized, killing 32 people, was headed to a Rome prison after losing his final appeals bid Friday. The Court of Cassation, Italy’s highest criminal tribunal, upheld Francesco Schettino’s lower court convictions and his 16-year prison sentence. Schettino was convicted of manslaughter and causing the shipwreck while captaining the luxury liner sailing near Giglio Island off Tuscany. He was also convicted of abandoning the capsizing vessel with passengers and crew still aboard. “Finally, Schettino begins to pay for his wrongdoing,” Michelina Suriano, one of the lawyers representing passengers, said after the ruling. Defence lawyer Saverio Senese called the ex-captain a scapegoat and expressed “great bitterness” over the final decision.
Pangilinan sees safeguard of ‘checks and balances’ at lower House  [SEP]  Senator Francis “Kiko” Pangilinan has expressed optimism that the “checks and balances” at the House of Representatives will be defended now that the militant Makabayan bloc decided to leave the supermajority coalition in Congress. Pangilinan lauded and welcomed the resolve of the seven-member party-list groups comprising the Makabayan bloc for defecting from the supermajority. “The assumption by the Makabayan bloc of an independent role at the House of Representatives assures that the democratic processes in the chamber would be preserved, and that another group may stand as a potent, vigilant, and credible fiscalizer against the imperfections and excesses of this administration,” the opoosition senator said. The Makabayan bloc assailed President Rodrigo Duterte’s administration for supposedly turning into “a fascist, pro-imperialist and anti-people” government. In a statement, the Makabayan bloc said: “Today, we, seven party list representatives of the Makabayan Bloc, declare our separation from the majority coalition in the House of Representatives to intensify our opposition to the Duterte administration that has now fully unraveled as a fascist, pro-imperialist and anti-people regime.” The group’s separation from the supermajority came after 119 lawmakers voted to slash the 2018 budget of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) to a meager P1,000. “Now that President Duterte and his allies are embarking on efforts to undermine the very institutions that serve as a check on his Executive powers, now that he is pushing for an insidious revision of the Constitution, now that he has revived his threat to declare martial law nationwide and impose a revolutionary government, we resolve to intensify efforts to defeat the emergence of a new dictatorship,” the Makabayan bloc said. The seven-member coalition includes progressive party-list lawmakers from Bayan Muna, Anakpawis, Kabataan, Gabriela and the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT-Teachers). /kga
Turkish troops seize Syrian town center from Kurdish fighters  [SEP]  Erdogan said Turkish soldiers along with rebel factions of the Free Syrian Army took complete control of Afrin town center at 8.30 am local time. He said mopping operations are underway and the Turkish flag has been raised in the town that sits less than 50 kilometers from the Turkish border. "Most of the terrorists fled already," Erdogan said. "Our special forces and Free Syrian Army are clearing the remaining few terrorists and the mines that they might have left. In the center of Afrin the symbols of peace and security are flying, not the rags of a terror organization. Now the Turkish flag is flying there. The FSA flag is flying there." Turkey launched its military offensive against US-backed Kurdish YPG militia in Afrin on January 20, supported by FSA rebel factions. Ankara says the YPG is an extension of the PKK, a marxist Kurdish militant group that has been waging an insurgency in southeast Turkey since the 1980s. Erdogan was speaking in Canakkale at an event to mark the anniversary of battle of the 1915 Battle of Gallipoli, one of the only major victories of Ottoman forces during the First World War, and an important moment in the history of Turkish nationalism. More than 150,000 people have been displaced in the last few days from Afrin town, a senior Kurdish official and a monitoring
Venezuela quells 'paramilitary' attack at base | GantNews.com  [SEP]  Venezuela remained a powder keg on Sunday as authorities said they had quelled an anti-government paramilitary attack at a military base and the country’s attorney general defied her ouster by the newly elected National Constituent Assembly. A man who identified himself as an army officer announced the revolt on social media, an action he called a “legitimate rebellion” aimed at the government of leftist President Nicolás Maduro. “We are united now, more than ever, with the brave people of Venezuela who do not recognize the legitimacy of Nicolás Maduro’s murderous tyranny,” according to a man who said he was Capt. Juan Caguaripano. The President, speaking on his weekly TV show, “Sundays with Maduro,” made reference to the incident, saying “a week ago, we won with votes and today we had to beat terrorism with bullets.” “They attack with terrorism and hate. We attack with our work, our love. They destruct, we construct,” he said. Sunday’s incident came amid daily anxiety in the South American nation, where the economic hardship and bloody political turmoil that had roiled the country for months came to a head last week when the Constituent Assembly was voted into office, taking the place of the opposition-led National Assembly. Authorities said the early-morning rebellion, which took place at a military base in Valencia, about 150 kilometers (95 miles) west of Caracas, was swiftly contained. Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino said the attack was carried out by “delinquent civilians wearing military uniforms” in the early morning hours of Sunday, an act he labeled a “terrorist attack of a paramilitary nature.” A tweet from the Venezuelan Minister of Communications Ernesto Villegas said seven people have been in the “mercenary attack” and an eighth person has been injured. Social media videos showed a group of men in military uniforms launching a resistance movement they called “Operation David.” The man speaking in the video who identified himself as Caguaripano was with a dozen others, people he identified as soldiers from the 41st Brigade of Fort Paramacay in the city of Valencia. “I am joined here by officers and troops from this glorious unit who represent the real Venezuelan army, that has fought to forge our liberty,” Caguaripano said in a video on social media. The move, Caguaripano said in the video, was not a “coup.” “It is a civic and military action meant to reestablish the constitutional order and, more importantly, to save the country from its total destruction and to keep our young people and families from being murdered,” he said. But Padrino said Caguaripano was a “first lieutenant who had deserted his post,” and those involved in the attack had been “repelled immediately.” Privately-owned online news channel Vivo Play broadcast video from outside the Fort Paramacay showing tanks moving inside the base and helicopters surrounding it. There were news images in Valencia of a barricade set by anti-government activists in flames. The National Constituent Assembly held its first session Saturday. In its first order of business, the assembly unanimously fired Attorney General Luisa Ortega Diaz. They barred her from ever seeking public office again in Venezuela, prohibited her from leaving the country and froze her assets. Her removal from office happened after she said she would open an investigation into fraud allegations surrounding last Sunday’s election. But Ortega, speaking Sunday at Caracas’ Universidad Católica Andrés Bello, sloughed off the exercise. “I will continue being the attorney general of this country,” she told reporters. Ortega called the election illegal and scolded the Maduro government. “I thought they had principles, ethics and values,” she said. The new assembly has wide-ranging powers and is expected to rewrite the Venezuelan Constitution at Maduro’s behest. Maduro’s loyal supporters buoyantly cast votes for new members last Sunday. Staunch opposition supporters, who see the vote as a power grab and an erosion of democracy, boycotted the vote and staged demonstrations against the development. The firing defied the regional Organization of American States, whose human rights commission Saturday warned the Venezuelan government to guarantee Ortega’s safety and allow her to continue as attorney general. South America’s trade bloc, Mercosur, decided to suspend Venezuela indefinitely from the group until there was a “re-establishment of democratic order.” The Organization of American States applauded that decision. Mercosur’s decision is mostly symbolic and will not impact trade or the free movement of Venezuelans among Mercosur countries. The US Treasury Department issued sanctions in July against Saab and 12 other Maduro loyalists. The assembly has proposed a “restructuring” of the attorney general’s office and nominated Tarek William Saab, a Maduro ally and former ombudsman, to be the interim attorney general. He was sworn in late Saturday afternoon to a rousing applause from the Constituent Assembly.
Developing: Trump Orders Russian Consulate Closed, Expels Russian Diplomats  [SEP]  The Trump administration ordered the expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats on Monday and the closing of the Russian consulate in Seattle in response to the nation’s alleged role in poisoning an ex-spy and his daughter in Great Britain. The move came in concert with more than a dozen European nations directing Russian diplomats to leave their soil. “This is the largest expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in United States history,” said U.S. Ambassador to Russia Jon Huntsman, according to The Associated Press. On March 4, former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter were attacked with a nerve agent in Salisbury, England, leaving both in critical condition. British authorities determined the agent was Russian in origin. In response, Great Britain expelled 23 diplomats. British Prime Minister Theresa May said 18 countries have joined her nation in ousting an additional 100 Russia spies. The White House issued a statement early Monday morning explaining the actions the U.S. was taking. “Today President Donald J. Trump ordered the expulsion of dozens of Russian intelligence officers from the United States and the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle due to its proximity to one of our submarine bases and Boeing,” the statement read. “The United States takes this action in conjunction with our NATO allies and partners around the world in response to Russia’s use of a military-grade chemical weapon on the soil of the United Kingdom, the latest in its ongoing pattern of destabilizing activities around the world,” it continued. Twelve of the 60 ordered to leave the United States are from Russia’s mission to the United Nations. “The United States and many of our friends are sending a clear message that we will not stand for Russia’s misconduct,” U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said. “Here in New York, Russia uses the United Nations as a safe haven for dangerous activities within our own borders.” The Trump administration has ordered the Russian consulate in Seattle closed by April 2. RELATED: Nunes: We Found Links Between Clinton, the Democrat Party, and Russia According to the AP, Monday’s directive marked the largest expulsion of Russians in history, eclipsing the 1986 Reagan administration order of the removal of 55 individuals accused of engaging in espionage. In December 2016, the Obama administration kicked out 35 suspected Russian intelligence operative in retaliation for Moscow’s attempts to influence the U.S. presidential election. On Monday, multiple European nations stood in solidarity with Britain, as well, in demanding Russians out. “We remain critical of the actions of the Russian government,” European Council President Donald Tusk said as he announced the actions by 14 European Union countries to expel Russian diplomats, The Washington Post reported. “Additional measures, including further expulsions within the common E.U. framework, are not to be excluded in the coming days and weeks.” “Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Finland, Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Ukraine and Canada all announced that they would expel diplomats or intelligence agents,” according to The Post. Moscow appeared to make light of the U.S. actions, hinting it will be taking retaliatory steps. The Russian embassy tweeted a poll asking users to vote which U.S. consulate should be closed in their country: Vladivostok, Yekaterinburg or St. Petersburg. In more serious tweet, the Russian embassy urged the U.S. to help calm the British government. “Russia U.S. relations are so multilayered,” a statement accompanying the tweet read. “Strategic stability of the entire world depends on it. They should not be taken hostage by clearly staged stories.” What do you think? Scroll down to comment below.
US, Australia to play 2 men's hoop exhibitions in Melbourne  [SEP]  COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. — The U.S. men's basketball team will play two exhibition games against Australia in Melbourne ahead of the 2019 Basketball World Cup. The Americans and Australians will play Aug. 22 and 24, 2019, at Etihad Stadium. The announcement was made Saturday night by USA Basketball. The teams have met in the last four Olympics, with the U.S. winning each game. The Americans pulled out a 98-88 victory in 2016 in their most recent meeting. The Basketball World Cup will be held Aug. 31-Sept. 15, 2019, in China. The tournament will be used as a qualifier for the 2020 Olympics.
Garbage dump landslide in Ethiopia kills at least 50  [SEP]  ADDIS ABABA, March 13 (Reuters) - Desperate parents scrabbled through a towering pile of fetid garbage in the Ethiopian capital on Monday, screaming the names of missing children buried in a landslide after a mound of trash collapsed on an informal settlement killing at least 50. "My babies, my babies, my little daughter," cried one man wandering through the site, tears streaming down his face. Neighbours said he had lost four children. The landslide late on Saturday also destroyed 49 dwellings and left 28 people injured, city spokesman Amare Mekonen said. Hundreds of people live on the 50-year-old Reppi dump, the city's only landfill site, scavenging for food and items they can sell such as recyclable metal. The tragedy highlights the desperate poverty that drags down many Ethiopian families despite the country's rapid economic growth and government moves to position the East African nation as a regional power. On Monday, rescuers used bulldozers to move piles of trash as hundreds of people gathered at the scene, weeping and praying. Some dug through the garbage with their hands. A ripple of dread ran through the crowd as a body was unearthed and taken away, wrapped in a sheet. Earlier, residents angrily turned on journalists filming the scene, driving them away with stones. Meselu Damte, the neighbour of the weeping man, said he lost his wife and four children. "Their bodies were found in the morning," she said. "There are still houses that are to be found and many of my neighbours are inside." Ethiopia is one of Africa's fastest growing economies, largely fuelled by government-driven investment, but the drive to industrialise has also stoked discontent among those who feel left behind. In October, the government imposed a national state of emergency after more than 500 people were killed in protests in Oromiya region as anger over a development scheme for the capital sparked broader anti-government demonstrations.

This is when the Birmingham House of Fraser store will close  [SEP]  Up to 6,000 jobs are under threat after embattled department store chain House of Fraser announced 31 of its 59 stores are set to shut across the UK and Ireland as part of a rescue plan. House of Fraser said the planned closures, which include its Oxford Street store, come as part of a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) - a controversial insolvency procedure in vogue among struggling retailers. If the CVA is approved by landlords, it will affect up to 2,000 House of Fraser staff and a further 4,000 across brands and concessions. It said the shops earmarked for closure would remain open until early 2019. The group said it also plans to relocate its Baker Street head office and the Granite House office in Glasgow to help slash costs and "secure House of Fraser's future". Alex Williamson, chief executive of House of Fraser, said: "Today's announcement is one of the most important in this company's 169-year history. "We, as a management team, have a responsibility to take necessary steps to ensure House of Fraser's survival, which is why we are making these proposals. "We are fully committed to supporting those personally affected by the proposals." The House of Fraser stores identified for closure under the CVA proposal are: Two stores are excluded from the CVA proposals - Dundrum in the Republic of Ireland and Beatties in Solihull because they are separate legal entities.
California Assembly Votes To Allow Communists To Hold State Jobs  [SEP]  California may end a decades-old ban on members of the Communist Party working in its government, after the state Assembly approved a bill that would delete references to the party from its employment requirements. The bill's sponsor, Assemblymember Rob Bonta, D-Oakland, said that California's laws should focus on individuals' actions and evidence rather than political affiliations and what he termed "empty labels." Speaking on the floor of the Assembly, Bonta called the legislation a "cleanup bill that removes archaic and outdated references to the Communist Party in our state laws, specifically those stating that a public employee may be dismissed from employment if he or she advocates or is knowingly a member of the Communist Party." The bill passed by a 41-30 margin, after a debate that touched on the Cold War, the U.S. history of fighting communism — and the potential for future conflicts. While Bonta called the measure "an appropriate step forward" for the state, three of his Republican colleagues in the California Assembly rose to speak against the bill, AB 22. "This bill is blatantly offensive to all Californians," said Assemblyman Travis Allen, R-Huntington Beach, who said his constituents include former refugees who fled Vietnam's Communist regime. "Communism stands for everything that the United States stands against." Allen concluded, "To allow subversives and avowed Communists to now work for the state of California is a direct insult to the people of California who pay for that government." Assemblymember Randy Voepel, R-Santee, also opposed the bill, noting America's history of going to war to combat communism. "There are 1.9 million veterans in California," Voepel said. "Many of us fought the communists. They are still a threat. We have North Korea, that wants to do us in. We have China, who is a great, great threat to the United States." After those objections were raised, Bonta told his colleagues that the legislation includes a provision that allows the dismissal of any state employee "if that public employee advocates or is knowingly a member" of an organization that works toward "the overthrow of the government of the United States or any state by force or violence." The California chairman for the Communist Party USA, Juan Lopez, has pushed to roll back similar bans in recent years — including one that forbids teachers from being in his party. The Communist Party isn't a registered political party in California, Lopez told the Daily Bulletin back in 2013.
Brendan Dassey, profiled in Making a Murderer series, ordered released  [SEP]  A man whose homicide conviction was overturned in a case profiled in the Netflix series “Making a Murderer” has been ordered released from prison while prosecutors appeal. U.S. Magistrate Judge William Duffin on Monday ordered the release of Brendan Dassey. Duffin ruled in August that investigators tricked Dassey into confessing he helped his uncle, Steven Avery, rape, kill and mutilate photographer Teresa Halbach in 2005. The state has appealed that ruling. Dassey’s supervised release was not immediate and is contingent upon him meeting multiple conditions. He has until noon Tuesday to provide the federal probation and parole office with the address of where he planned to live. Dassey was 16 when Halbach died. He’s now 27.
Under GOP draft of Obamacare repeal plan, a lot of people could lose coverage  [SEP]  These provisions could leave a significant share of the 20 million people who gained coverage under Obamacare without insurance. The proposal would go fully into effect in 2020. “A substantial number of people could lose coverage because it’s no longer affordable,” said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation. The draft bill, which was dated two weeks ago and was obtained by CNN Friday, closely follows House Republicans’ previous proposals to repeal Obamacare, though it actually offers somewhat larger tax credits and stronger protections for those with pre-existing conditions. The bill, which was first reported by Politico, has been updated since, but remains in the “same ballpark,” a GOP source told CNN. Lawmakers plan to release a final version of the bill the week of March 6. This framework, however, would likely not be enough to allow everyone to keep their plans. Ohio Governor John Kasich, a more moderate Republican, said he “completely” disagrees with the draft legislation and the size of the tax credits. He said he discussed it with President Trump in their meeting Friday. “I just told him it was inadequate,” Kasich told reporters. “To me, it’s not acceptable.” On top of that, it’s questionable whether some of the provisions outlined in the draft bill could be accomplished through budget reconciliation — the Republicans’ chosen method for repealing Obamacare because it only requires a simple majority in the Senate. Legislation passed under reconciliation must be tied to federal spending and revenues. Insurance reforms, such as eliminating federal mandates on what benefits insurers must cover and allowing insurers to charge older Americans more, do not appear to be allowed, experts said. Also, it remains unclear how the Republicans would pay for the plan. The GOP legislation eliminates all Obamacare taxes quickly, but keeps the law’s subsidies and Medicaid expansion spending until 2020. It only contains one provision that would raise revenue — capping the tax exclusion on employer-sponsored plans. Here’s what the proposal would do: Replaces income-based subsidies with age-based tax credits: Instead of getting a subsidy based on your income and the premiums in your area, you’d receive a refundable tax credit based on your age. The credits would range from $2,000 for those under 30 to $4,000 for those between age 60 and 64. (It does not apply to those on Medicare.) While these credits are more generous than those laid out in a plan proposed in 2015 by former Representative Tom Price, now the health secretary, they still may not be enough to make coverage affordable for everyone, particularly for older folks, lower-income Americans or those living in areas with high medical costs. That’s because the GOP tax credit doesn’t take into account income or the price of insurance plans in a certain area like the Obamacare subsidies do. And it would not provide as large a subsidy for older enrollees, who pay up to three times as much for coverage as younger ones. (The GOP plan calls for increasing this ratio to up to five times as much, leaving older participants to foot an even larger share of the premium after their tax credit.) Obamacare’s subsidies, on the other hand, allow eligible enrollees to buy a plan for less than 10% of their income. However, there is a group of Americans who would benefit from the Republican plan — those who earn too much to receive assistance under Obamacare. Those who make above 400% of the poverty level — $47,520 for an individual or $97,200 for a family of four — don’t receive any assistance under Obamacare. This group has long complained the unsubsidized premiums render Obamacare policies unaffordable. Also, freeing insurers from the federal requirement to provide certain benefits, such as maternity and prescription drugs, would let them offer less expensive plans. Republicans argue that giving consumers more choice of benefits packages would make coverage more affordable. Eliminates Medicaid expansion funds and caps federal spending: The draft legislation doesn’t repeal Medicaid expansion for low-income adults, but it eliminates the enhanced federal reimbursement for new enrollees starting in 2020. Since many people drop out of Medicaid during the course of a year, the number covered under expansion would dwindle over time. “Without an enhanced match, few states will be able to continue covering adults eligible under expansion,” said Deborah Bachrach, partner at Manatt, Health Solutions, a consulting firm. Under Obamacare, states got more federal matching funds to cover newly eligible, low income adults. The federal government paid 100% of the costs of these new participants for the first three years and is slowly reducing the reimbursement to 90% by 2020. It covers between 50% and 74% of the cost of the traditional Medicaid population, depending on the state. The Republican bill also calls for overhauling the way the federal government pays for all Medicaid recipients. Instead of reimbursing states a share of what they spend, it would send a fixed payment per participant. The amount would be based on the state’s average spending in fiscal year 2016, with an adjustment for inflation. Allows insurers to charge more to those who let coverage lapse, but protects those with pre-existing conditions: The Republicans would eliminate the individual mandate as of last year — so those who didn’t have coverage wouldn’t have to pay the penalty. And there’d be no requirement to get insurance going forward. But to encourage Americans to maintain coverage, lawmakers would allow insurers to charge those who had lapsed up to 130% of the premium for the first year once they re-enroll. Republicans consider this provision to be the stick that will entice all Americans — particularly the young and healthy — to remained insured. It’s critical to keep these folks in the market since they offset the costs of those who are older and sick. Since Republicans would keep Obamacare’s ban on discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions, the creation of state-based, high-risk pools to cover the sick who can’t get insurance would be less important. Instead, the legislation calls for giving states $100 billion over nine years in innovation grants to help cover high-cost enrollees. States could use the funding in a variety of ways, including reducing insurers’ cost of covering these policyholders, lowering people’s out-of-pocket costs or providing financial assistance to high-risk enrollees in the individual market. Among the most controversial would be eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood and barring the use of tax credits to pay for policies that cover abortion. Another one that will meet with a lot of resistance is capping the tax break on employer-sponsored coverage. Currently, those premiums are excluded from tax, which economists argue dampens wages and encourages unnecessary use of medical care. The Republican plan would limit the exclusion to the cost of the 90th percentile plan nationwide — that is, the priciest 10% of plans would have to pay tax on the premiums above this threshold. This would replace Obamacare’s reviled Cadillac Tax, which was delayed until 2020 amid pressure from companies and unions. The bill would also increase how much people could sock away in Health Savings Accounts to the amount of their deductible and out-of-pocket limit. Congressional Democrats were quick to jump on the bill, saying it would hurt many Americans. “Not only would it force working families to pay more for less coverage, it would make drastic cuts to Medicaid and cause millions to lose their coverage altogether,” said Representative Steny Hoyer. The bill is also a mixed bag for insurers. It gives them more latitude in what they must cover and how much they can charge older participants. But it requires them to continue covering those with pre-existing conditions without the individual mandate to bring in younger and healthier enrollees. The elimination of the mandate could prompt carriers to drop out of the individual market, Levitt said. Already, Humana has announced that it will not participate in 2018, and several other large carriers are weighing their involvement. “This is what terrifies insurers,” Levitt said.

Liu breaks 50-meter backstroke world record at Asian Games  [SEP]  JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Liu Xiang of China has set a world record time of 26.98 seconds to win the women's 50-meter backstroke gold medal at the Asian Games. Liu has become the first woman to swim under 27 seconds in the event, breaking the mark of 27.06 set by fellow Chinese swimmer Zhao Jing at the 2009 world championships in Rome. Fu Yuanhui took silver in 27.68 in a 1-2 finish for China and Natsumi Sakai of Japan took bronze in 27.91.
Data Analytics Firm Harvested 50 Million Facebook Profiles  [SEP]  (CBSNEWS.COM) – A prominent data analytics firm that worked with President Trump’s campaign exploited Facebook data to harvest “millions” of profiles of U.S. voters without their authorization, according to a whistleblower who once worked to help acquire the data. On Friday, Facebook announced Cambridge Analytica — the firm that was created by billionaire donor Robert Mercer, previously run by Steve Bannon, who went on to become White House chief strategist, and received $5.9 million from Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign — has been suspended for violating the social media company’s standards and practices. Christopher Wylie, who worked to help obtain the data, told Britain’s The Observer that Cambridge’s entire operation was designed to “exploit” what they knew about people from their profiles and “target their inner demons.” Cambridge Analytica specializes in “psychographic” profiling that allows them to predict the voting likelihoods of individual people based on personality — and Facebook is a treasure trove for information like that. “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,” Wylie told the British news outlet. “And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis that the entire company was built on.” In a statement Friday, Facebook acknowledged that it learned it had been “lied to” about Cambridge Analytica and an affiliate’s activities in 2015, more than two years before suspending the firm from its platform, but did not alert users at the time. The Observer reported that Facebook made only minor efforts to secure the information of more than 50 million people. Facebook insists there was no breach of their system. Facebook acknowledged that it learned at the time that University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan “lied to us and violated our platform policies” by passing data from an app that lets people log in using their Facebook account to Cambridge Analytica and Eunoia Technologies Inc.’s Wylie. Facebook says Kogan requested access for his personality predictor app “thisisyourdigitallife.” Facebook said that in 2015 it removed the professor’s app and demanded the destruction of all information acquired — which Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified that it destroyed. But several days ago, the social media company said, it learned that perhaps not all data had been destroyed. Facebook says it is still investigating those claims. The New York Times also reported that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica still existed online, and reporters accessed the raw data. In a statement, Cambridge Analytica said it “fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.” The company also said it deleted all information. “In 2014, we contracted a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally-renowned institution to undertake a large scale research project in the United States,” Cambridge said in a statement. “This company, Global Science Research (GSR), was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent. GSR was also contractually the Data Controller (as per Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act) for any collected data. GSR obtained Facebook data via an API provided by Facebook.” Cambridge Analytica also said that “no data from GSR” was used by Cambridge as a part of services it provided to Mr. Trump’s campaign. “When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR. We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted. No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign. Cambridge Analytica only receives and uses data that has been obtained legally and fairly. Our robust data protection policies comply with US, international, European Union, and national regulations.” A spokesman for Cambridge Analytica also said the firm refutes the stories from the Guardian, which is associated with the Observer, and the New York Times, and rejects Wylie. “We refute the claims made by The New York Times, The Guardian, and their source, a former contractor to the company, Mr Christopher Wylie (“Mr Wylie”), in what is patently a malicious attempt to hurt the company,” the spokesman told CBS News. “We were forced to take action against Mr Christopher Wylie to prevent his misuse of the company’s intellectual property and he is the subject of restraining undertakings in this regard. It is clear that he has a grudge to bear and appears set on trying to damage the company.” Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign spent $5.9 million in five payments on Cambridge Analytica from June 2016 through December 2016, according to Federal Election Commission (FEC) records. But his campaign wasn’t the only one. The presidential campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spent nearly as much — $5.8 million — on the data analytics firm. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is also interested in Cambridge Analytica, as his team investigates Russian election meddling and any ties to the Trump campaign, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. The newspaper reported Mueller asked the firm to hand over internal records. Social media sites and Facebook specifically were prominent tools in Mueller’s indictment of 13 Russians accused of leveraging fake social media accounts to influence the 2016 presidential campaign.
Kim Jong Un is reportedly reaching out to South Korea because he's scared Trump will strike  [SEP]  North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrives for the official opening of the Ryomyong residential area, Thursday, April 13, 2017, in Pyongyang, North Korea. AP Photo/Wong Maye-E • One of the highest-ever ranked defectors from North Korea has said that Kim Jong Un is now engaging in diplomacy with South Korea because he fears a US military strike on North Korea. • The defector also said that international sanctions are crushing Kim's economy, and that now he wants to buy time to complete his nuclear arsenal. • North Korea is under international pressure like never before, and the new US commander in the Pacific has taken a hawkish tone against the Kim regime. One of the highest-ever ranked defectors from North Korea said Wednesday that Kim Jong Un is now engaging in diplomacy with South Korea because he fears a US military strike on North Korea. "Kim Jong Un is afraid that the US will launch a preventative strike, and he is trying to buy time to complete his nuclear and missile programs," said Ri Jong Ho, Yonhap News Agency reported. Ri, who worked for three decades in the North Korean office responsible for raising funds for Kim, was speaking at a Wilson Center forum in Washington. According to Ri, not only are President Donald Trump's threats of military action having an effect on North Korea, the US's diplomatic efforts to lock Pyongyang out of international trade have also started to bite. "Kim Jong Un is struggling under the strongest-yet sanctions and military and diplomatic pressure, so he is trying to improve the situation by putting on a false front," Ri said. Ri, who defected in 2014, likely doesn't know the current thinking in Pyongyang, but may have knowledge of the economic situation before the sanctions. Ri's statements follow a handful of moves from the Trump administration that appeared to signal that they were on the verge of striking North Korea. But Ri's statements also conjured up one of the US's worst fears in North Korea by suggesting that Kim did not legitimately want to pursue peace with South Korea, but rather that he wanted to use the ruse of diplomacy to buy time while he advances his nuclear program and continues to hold South Korean civilians at risk. "Depending on the circumstances, North Korea could hold South Koreans hostage and continue its threatening provocations," Ri said. Ri's thinking seems to agree with US Navy Adm. Harry Harris, who recently assumed command of the US military's Pacific and Asian theater of operation, PACOM. Kim is "after reunification under a single communist system, so he is after what his grandfather failed to do and his father failed to do," Harris said Wednesday, in testimony to the House Armed Services Committee. But Kim's end game is irrelevant at the present. There's evidence that a US-led sanctions campaign has begun to work against the Kim regime, and North Korea could be hurting economically. Moves in Trump's inner circle seem to heavily suggest he's considering responding to future North Korean provocations with force. No president before Trump has coordinated as great an international sanctions regime on North Korea, and none have so seriously offered up use of military force as an option. In response, Kim has made the unprecedented move of a greeing to meet with a foreign head of state for the first time, and abandoned talk of preconditions beforehand, which some see as a concession.
Turnout low in Lebanon's first parliamentary election in 9 years  [SEP]  Turnout was 54% in the last election in 2009, he said. The highest voting turnout was in the second district in the north, and the lowest in Beirut's first district, with 31.5%, he said. Lamenting the tepid turnout, he said "whoever didn't vote cannot object to what happens in the future." Machnouk said official results were expected at 4 a.m. local time Monday (9 p.m. ET Sunday). Earlier in the day, Lebanese President Michel Aoun tweeted: "I was surprised by the low turnout and the exercise of the right to vote. I renew the appeal, if you wish to change and to establish a new approach, you must exercise your right." The election may shift the balance in the nation's coalition government. Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shia group, is the most powerful bloc in the election. Trying to hold back Hezbollah's growing influence is Prime Minister Saad Hariri. He leads the Mustaqbal, or Future, bloc that is backed by Saudi Arabia, Iran's Sunni rival. His father also previously served as prime minister. Both groups are seeking control of a parliamentary majority through highly complex coalitions with allies. Both groups have campaigned aggressively. Hezbollah's secretary-general, Hassan Nasrallah , has given televised speeches on a nearly weekly basis. Hariri's exhausting four-hour convoy tours have made rounds across the country over the last month. Outside the power bases of Hariri and Hezbollah are a growing contingent of disenchanted voters. Nearly every Lebanese person CNN spoke to before the election said they had little hope in politicians' ability to tackle the country's litany of economic and security woes. As many as 800,000 voters under the age of 30 were expected to cast ballots for the first time. It was also the first time in Lebanese history that expats were allowed to vote. This election was also the first time in Lebanese history that electoral candidates promoted gay rights. Nearly 100 candidates publicly called for the decriminalization of homosexuality.
Monsoon-Triggered Mudslides, Floods In Sri Lanka Kill More Than 90 People  [SEP]  Heavy rains in Sri Lanka have prompted devastating mudslides and flooding, killing at least 91 people and leaving more than 100 missing, according to authorities. Search and rescue operations are currently underway, the Sri Lankan Disaster Management Center says. Five rivers in the south and west of the island have flooded, affecting more than 61,000 people, the agency says. The Associated Press reports that heavy rains are expected to continue, and that marooned victims are being rescued by helicopter and boat: "Deputy Minister for Disaster Management Dunesh Kankanda said many people were on roofs and treetops calling for help. "Many homes and roads were inundated. Schools were closed in the province of Sabaragamuwa, about 90 kilometers (55 miles) east of Colombo. "Aid groups, rescuers and other government workers were ordered to cancel any holidays and remain on alert for the next three days." A year ago, torrential rains in Sri Lanka triggered landslides that buried three villages. The mud was 30 feet deep in some areas, one rescue operator told Reuters at the time. That disaster killed more than 100 people and completely destroyed more than 500 houses, AFP reported. Sri Lanka's southwest monsoon season runs from May to September. But Reuters reports that recent rainfall has been unusually heavy, even for this rainy period. "Sri Lankan meteorology officials said Thursday's rains are the worst since 2003," the wire service says. And the AP notes that the region is increasingly vulnerable to rain-triggered landslides. "Mudslides have become common during the monsoon season in the tropical Indian Ocean island as land has been heavily deforested to grow export crops such as tea and rubber," the news service writes.
The Latest: Obama tells UN world less violent  [SEP]  UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The Latest on the high-level U.N. General Assembly meetings (all times local): President Barack Obama is telling world leaders that a paradox defines the world today as the world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before. Yet, he says that people are losing trust in institutions, which makes governing more difficult. Obama says world leaders can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration, or they can retreat into a world that is sharply divided and ultimately in conflict. Obama is addressing the United Nations for the final time as president. Obama says the benefits of global integration need to be broadly shared. He says the global economy needs to work better for all people, not just those at the top. The top U.S. diplomat has urged Pakistan’s prime minister to prevent “all terrorists” from using the nation’s territory as safe havens. The appeal from Secretary of State John Kerry to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif came as tensions escalated between Pakistan and India after suspected rebels killed 18 Indian soldiers in an attack on a military base in the disputed territory of Kashmir. The State Department said Tuesday that Kerry met Sharif Monday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Kerry expressed “strong concern” with the recent violence in Kashmir, particularly Sunday’s attack, and called on all sides to reduce tensions. He also urged restraint in nuclear weapons programs. India on Tuesday accused Pakistan of firing at an Indian military position in Kashmir, which Pakistan denied. Taking the world stage for the last time as secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon unleashes years of pent-up anger at leaders who keep “feeding the war machine” in Syria, violate human rights and prevent aid deliveries to starving people. The U.N. chief told leaders at Tuesday’s opening of General Assembly’s annual ministerial meeting that “powerful patrons” of both sides in the more than five-year Syrian conflict “have blood on their hands” “Present in this hall today are representatives of governments that have ignored, facilitated, funded, participated in or even planned and carried out atrocities inflicted by all sides of the Syria conflict against Syrian civilians,” he said. Ban said “many groups have killed innocent civilians — none more so than the government of Syria.” And he accused South Sudan’s feuding leaders of betraying their people. He said “in too many places, we see leaders rewriting constitutions, manipulating elections and taking other desperate steps to cling to power.” Italian opera singer Andrea Bocelli kicks off the 71st session of the United Nations General Assembly as world leaders convene to address most pressing global and regional issues. Bocelli’s performance of Nessun Dorma on Monday earned a standing ovation from heads of state. U.N. officials say at least 20 countries are expected to formally join the Paris Agreement on climate change this week, greatly improving the pact’s chances of coming into force just a year after it was negotiated. That’s considered a blistering pace in the world of international diplomacy, reflecting a sense of urgency in the fight against global warming and a desire to seal the deal before the Obama administration leaves office. Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Morocco are expected to hand over documents at the U.N. in New York on Wednesday to formally complete the ratification process. At least half a dozen small island nations including Papua New Guinea, Tonga and Kiribati will also follow suit. Standing before the United Nations for the last time as president, Barack Obama will reassure foreign leaders that the world is better equipped to tackle its challenges than at almost any point in history despite a cascade of harrowing crises that seem devoid of viable solutions. Obama’s address marks his swan song on the international stage. He stepped into his role eight years ago with sky-high expectations and has struggled to deliver when it comes to solving global problems partially beyond America’s control. Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security adviser, said the president was cognizant of the fact that bright spots such as economic growth and climate change cooperation are offset by the “great deal of unease” in the world, including Syria’s civil war and concerns about Russia’s aggression toward Ukraine.
Protests follow house arrest of Hafiz Saeed  [SEP]  LAHORE: Protests were held in major cities on Tuesday after Hafiz Saeed, who heads the Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) group and has a $10 million bounty on his head, was placed under "preventative detention", according to an order from the Interior Ministry. This detention may also be called house arrest. Police took Saeed away from a mosque in Lahore late Monday and escorted him to his residence, hours after Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar had hinted action against him was imminent. JuD, listed as a terror outfit by the United Nations, is considered by the US and India to be a front for Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), the militant group blamed for the attack on India’s financial capital which killed more than 160 people. Some 300 JuD activists staged a demonstration in Islamabad, burning the flags of India and the United States, while a similar number protested in the central city of Multan. In Azad Kashmir, the group staged a joint rally with the Hizbul Mujahideen. "Kashmiris see Hafiz Saeed as their messiah and they will continue his mission. The government of Pakistan should behave and release him immediately," said Abdul Aziz Alvi, a local JuD leader. JuD has also announced it will challenge in court the detention order, which places the group and a foundation tied to it on a watch list and also places four other men under arrest. Islamabad has not officially commented on the move´s timing. Following a brief period of house arrest in 2008, Saaed led a high-profile public life and regularly delivered fiery anti-India speeches. JuD has operated freely across the country and is popular for its charity work, especially in the wake of natural disasters. But a senior security source based in Islamabad said the decision was in response to US pressure as well as a global perception that Pakistan has refused to tackle Islamist groups which pose no risk at home but carry out attacks abroad. "Yesterday´s actions were in fact a huge event," he said. "There´s been increasing US pressure on the issue, which compelled Pakistan to take this action. There has also been Indian pressure. They have always said unless you take certain steps things can´t move forward. So the move effectively kills two beasts with one arrow. Now India won´t have a chance to criticise Pakistan,” he said. Amir Rana, a security analyst, said Islamabad had come to realise it was facing increasing isolation over its alleged dealings with proxy fighters. "There was some stress on Pakistan´s foreign policy especially around this group," he said.

Iran protests continue; IRGC claims it defeated protesters as in 2009  [SEP]  Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said it has forcefully ended anti-government protests that officials in the Islamic Republic blamed on “foreign instigators.” “Iran’s revolutionary people along with tens of thousands of Basij forces, police and the Intelligence Ministry have broken down the chain [of unrest] created … by the United States, Britain, the Zionist regime [Israel], Saudi Arabia, the hypocrites [Mujahideen] and monarchists,” the IRGC said in a statement posted on Jan. 7 on its Sepah News website. Contrary to the IRGC’s statement, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) said it has received credible reports that protests continued in at least nine cities across Iran on Jan. 6, including Teheran, where social media footage showed gatherings despite a large police presence. RFE/RL’s Radio Farda also reported it obtained credible reports on Jan. 6 from sources in Iran about overnight demonstrations against Iran’s clerical rulers in Takestan, Arak, Masjed Soleiman, Mashhad, Qazvin, Rasht, Lahijan, and Khomein, the birthplace of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The protests are the largest in Iran since 2009, when widespread unrest erupted over what analysts say was an obviously rigged election in favor of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The IRGC and its Basij militia suppressed the unrest in 2009. Dozens of pro-reform Iranians were killed. State media has stopped reporting on anti-government protests, but broadcast live footage of a fifth day of pro-government rallies organized by authorities. While the Iranian government continues to insist the protests have been instigated by foreigners, a group of 16 prominent reformist figures living in Iran issued a statement rejecting that argument. In the Jan. 6 statement, the signatories said, “Despite the fact the enemies of the country always try to take advantage of such events, we should know that any kind of foreign interference would not be possible without the existence of internal conditions.” They added that, in addition to the government claim of foreign involvement being “an insult” to Iranians, it leads to “negligence toward the real causes of the protests.” Meanwhile, access to the social media app Telegram remained blocked on Jan. 7, despite claims from Iran’s FARS news agency that the restrictions on Telegram had been “fully lifted.” “The parliament is not in favor of keeping Telegram filtering in place, but it must pledge that it will not be used as a tool by the enemies of the Iranian people,” Behrouz Nemati, spokesman for the parliament’s presiding board, said. Almost a third of Iran’s 80 million people use the Telegram app as their main source of news and as a way of bypassing highly restrictive state media. Unlike the 2009 Green Movement, anti-government protesters over the last two weeks have garnered support from the United States. President Donald Trump has tweeted his support on several occasions. The 2009 rebellion’s failure “was assured” by President Barack Obama, Jed Babbin, a deputy undersecretary of defense in the George H.W. Bush administration, noted in a Jan. 7 analysis for The Washington Times. “Instead of helping the protesters, Obama criticized them, saying that they didn’t represent ‘fundamental change,’ ” Babbin wrote. “He spoke meekly, saying that, ‘The world is watching and inspired by their participation, regardless of what the ultimate outcome of the election was.’ ” Babbin continued: “As these protests and the Green Movement of 2009 proved, the ayatollahs’ regime is vulnerable. Regardless of what happens to the Iranian protesters in the next weeks, Trump needs to act decisively. “What Obama forbade in 2009 Trump should authorize in 2018. The CIA will have plans to fund and help the opposition organize fomenting revolution in Iran to oust the ayatollahs and return Iran to a semblance of freedom. That covert action can be authorized by a secret ‘presidential determination,’ which Trump should sign as soon as possible.” Later this month, Trump will again have to decide on certifying Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal. “Last October he refused to do that. Now he can do more,” Babbin wrote. Login To Your FaceBook to Make Comments
FC Barcelona Set New UEFA Champions League Record Against Paris St Germain FC  [SEP]  FC Barcelona is the first team in UEFA Champions League history to overturn a four-goal first-leg deficit, beating Paris St Germain 6-1 at the Nou Camp last night, March 9. The Spanish side began the night 4-0 down after the first leg. With 28 minutes remaining, FC Barcelona still required three more goals to progress. But two late goals from Brazilian striker Neymar, and the decisive final strike from substitute Sergio Roberto, saw FC Barcelona victorious and able to celebrate a tenth successive quarter-final berth. FC Barcelona’s “miracle makers,” as the club’s match report called them, pulled off “one of the most epic comebacks in the history of the Champions League.” But this competition is no stranger to late drama and extraordinary turnarounds. The 1999 final lives long in the memory of Manchester United FC’s fans, as their team scored two stoppage-time goals to beat Bayern Munich FC. Liverpool FC’s recovery from 3-0 down at half-time of the 2005 final was equally dramatic, eventually beating AC Milan on penalties in Istanbul. On the night, two first-half goals, and another just after the break, gave FC Barcelona improbable hope. But a 62nd-minute strike from Paris St Germain’s Uruguayan striker, Edison Cavani, appeared to put the tie beyond them. But the finale to “one of the greatest European ties of all time,” according to BBC Sports’ Louise Gwilliam, was sparked by Brazilian Neymar in the 88th minute. If his free kick reignited Barça’s hope, his penalty three minutes later, and assist for Roberto’s goal in the 95th-minute, unleashed what BBC Sports’ Andy West called “mayhem, utter mayhem” among FC Barcelona’s fans inside the Nou Camp. Paris St Germain FC had begun the match with one foot in their fifth Uefa Champions League quarter-final in-a-row. Out of these two giants of European football, it looked highly unlikely that the French club’s fans would be the ones walking away from the stadium disappointed into the Spanish night. Yet by the final whistle, the French champions were left only to reflect on what had gone wrong, as a 6-1 defeat on the night ended their hopes for this year’s Champions League title. If they were left in shock, it is understandable. Three weeks previously, FC Barcelona’s match report of the first leg admitted their team had “a mountain left to climb” to reach the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals, after a “miserable night at the Parc des Princes.” But climb it they were also expected to. The last time FC Barcelona failed to reach the quarter-final round was in 2006/07. Since then they have been a regular fixture in the latter stages of Europe’s premier club competition, winning it in 2011 and 2015. It is a club with a proud history, but with that comes both a belief in the improbable and a pressure to maintain their success. As the club’s match report from the first leg suggested, “if anyone can do this [win the tie], Barça can”. FC Barcelona’s victory over Paris St Germain FC bettered any other second-leg comeback in European tournament history. In the UEFA Champions League, the previous record was held by another Spanish side, Deportivo La Coruña, set in the quarter-finals of the 2003/04 tournament. Their opponents were the previous year’s champions, AC Milan. Trailing 4-1 from the first leg, Deportivo La Coruña won the tie 5-4 on aggregate, the decisive fourth goal also coming late in the tie, scored by Fran in the 76th minute. Last night, FC Barcelona’s players did climb their mountain. Their reward is a place in the 2016/2017 quarter-finals and in the UEFA Champions League all-time record books. Whatever else manager Luis Enrique achieves in his final season at the FC Barcelona, he and his players have already ensured their place in the illustrious history of this famous club.
White House Orders Russia to Close San Francisco Consulate, Other Annexes  [SEP]  WASHINGTON (CN) – The Trump administration on Thursday ordered Russia to close its San Francisco consulate, along with two annex buildings in New York and Washington, all by Saturday.
Despite Trump backlash, UK's May says  [SEP]  Despite Trump backlash, UK's May says "very happy" to invite him LONDON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May was "very happy" to invite U.S. President Donald Trump for a state visit to Britain, her Downing Street office said on Monday as May faced a popular backlash at home over the planned visit. Numerous politicians, including some in her own party ranks, have said a full state visit involving lavish royal pageantry would be inappropriate following Trump's controversial executive order on immigration restrictions, and a petition against the visit had gathered 1.3 million signatures by Monday lunchtime. "To be clear, the Prime Minister extended an invitation on behalf of the Queen - and she was very happy to do so. The USA is one of this country's closest allies, and we look forward to hosting the President later this year," Downing Street said.
Wimbledon 2018: Novak Djokovic beats Kevin Anderson to capture fourth title  [SEP]  WIMBLEDON, England—At the French Open last month, Novak Djokovic was disgusted. He lost to an unseeded opponent, the type of player Djokovic would normally destroy. The defeat hurt so much that he had no idea what he would do next. “I don’t know if I’m going to play on grass,” Djokovic said after the loss. “I don’t know what I’m going to do.” A little more than a month later, Djokovic has accomplished what few expected: He’s now the Wimbledon champion for the fourth time in his career and playing like the Djokovic of old. Djokovic on Sunday defeated Kevin Anderson in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2, 7-6(3). He crouched to the ground after hitting a service winner to clinch the match. Anderson, 32 years old, was playing the second Grand Slam final of his career. Last year he lost to Rafael Nadal in the U.S. Open final. For Djokovic, 31, this is his fourth Wimbledon title and the 13th major title in all, but likely his most satisfying. From 2011 to 2016, Djokovic was the best player in the world. He won 11 out of the 24 Grand Slam events he entered, and in 2015 fell one victory short of a full Grand Slam season, which was last achieved by Rod Laver in 1969. He did, however, accomplish a feat that neither Roger Federer or Nadal have done. Djokovic won four straight Grand Slam finals from Wimbledon in 2015 to the French Open in 2016. After that rare streak, everyone thought Djokovic would continue to dominate. An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.
Brain changes seen in pregnancy, may help preparing for baby  [SEP]  NEW YORK (AP) — Pregnancy affects not only a woman’s body: It changes parts of her brain too, a new study says. When researchers compared brain scans of women before and after pregnancy, they spotted some differences in 11 locations. They also found hints that the alterations help women prepare for motherhood. For example, they might help a mother understand the needs of her infant, Elseline Hoekzema, a study author at Leiden University in the Netherlands, explained via email. The women were also given memory tests, and they showed no signs of decline. Hoekzema, a neuroscientist, began working on the study while at the Autonomous University of Barcelona in Spain. She and colleagues present the results in a paper released Monday by the journal Nature Neuroscience. The study includes data on 25 Spanish women scanned before and after their first pregnancies, along with 20 women who didn’t get pregnant during the study. The brain changes in the pregnancy group emerged from comparisons of those two groups. The results were consistent: A computer program could tell which women had gotten pregnant just by looking at results of the MRI scans. And the changes, first documented an average of 10 weeks after giving birth, were mostly still present two years after childbirth. That’s based on follow-up with 11 study participants. Further work showed they’re a motherhood thing: No brain changes were seen in first-time fathers. Based on prior research findings, the researchers think the brain changes happened during pregnancy rather than after childbirth. What’s going on? Hoekzema and colleagues think the differences result from sex hormones that flood the brain of a pregnant woman. In the 11 places, the MRI data indicate reductions in volume of the brain’s gray matter, but it’s not clear what that means. For example, it could reflect loss of brain cells or a pruning of the places where brain cells communicate, called synapses. Losing some synapses is not necessarily a bad thing. It happens during a hormonal surge in adolescence, producing more specialized and efficient brain circuits. The researchers suspect that could be happening in the pregnant women. Some study results hint that such upgrades may prepare a woman for motherhood. One analysis linked brain changes to how strongly a woman felt emotionally attached to her infant. And when women viewed pictures of their babies, several brain regions that reacted the most were ones that showed pregnancy-related change. In addition, the affected brain areas overlapped with circuitry that’s involved in figuring out what another person is thinking and feeling. That’s a handy ability for a mother tending to an infant. The idea of synapses being pruned in pregnancy makes a lot of sense, commented Bruce McEwen of Rockefeller University in New York, who studies hormonal effects on the brain but didn’t participate in what he called a terrific study. “The brain is being shaped all the time,” he said, and “sex hormones are part of the whole orchestra of processes that change the brain structurally.”
In last flight of a Delta 2, NASA launches satellite to measure changes in ice sheets and glaciers  [SEP]  A NASA satellite designed to precisely measure changes in Earth's ice sheets, glaciers, sea ice and vegetation was launched into orbit from California early Saturday. A Delta 2 rocket carrying ICESat-2 lifted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base at 6:02 a.m. and headed over the Pacific Ocean toward a polar orbit. NASA Earth Science Division director Michael Freilich says that the mission in particular will advance knowledge of how the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica contribute to sea level rise. The melt from those ice sheets alone has raised global sea level by more than 1 millimeter (0.04 inch) a year recently, according to NASA. The mission is a successor to the original Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite that operated from 2003 to 2009. Measurements have continued since then with airborne instruments in NASA's Operation IceBridge. Built by Northrop Grumman, ICESat-2 carries a single instrument — a laser altimeter that measures height by determining how long it takes photons to travel from the spacecraft to Earth and back. According to NASA, it will collect more than 250 times as many measurements as the first ICESat. The laser is designed to fire 10,000 times per second, divided into six beams of hundreds of trillions of photons. The round trip is timed to a billionth of a second. In addition to ice, the satellite's other measurements, such as the tops of trees, snow and river heights, may help with research into the amount of carbon stored in forests, flood and drought planning and wildfire behavior, among other uses. The launch was the last for a Delta 2 rocket, United Launch Alliance said. The first Delta 2 lifted off on Feb. 14, 1989, and since then it has been the launch vehicle for Global Positioning System orbiters, Earth-observing and commercial satellites, and interplanetary missions including the twin Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity.
Are England Perennially unfortunate at World Cup?  [SEP]  FIFA World Cup: Have England been Perennially unfortunate in the competition's history? England's football team is one which undergoes intense scrutiny from its own media as well as fans before any major international tournament. Expectations have always been at a premium, though time and again, the team failed to justify them. England's young squad put in a valiant display at this year's world cup and made it to the semi-finals before getting knocked out by an excellent Croatian performance. Even though they couldn't win it, they still earned plaudits from fans and media alike for their excellent performances. But here we look back at some previous World Cup performances where more often than not, misfortune played a major part in deciding the fate of England: England barely scraped through to the knockout rounds from an easy group, including USA, Algeria and Slovenia, in second position to set up a last-16 tie with Germany. However, this image went on to haunt the English team in the aftermath of this tournament. Trailing 2-1, Lampard's fierce shot struck the crossbar, went in and bounced back as Neuer collected the ball pretending as if nothing happened. Somehow even the officials failed to spot the incident and the goal was denied. Capitalizing on this let-off, the Germans went on to score 2 more goals as England were ruthlessly knocked out 4-1. However, the one good that came out of it was the introduction of Goal-line technology which has since prevented such incidents from taking place.
French police seize explosives in raid, arrest 4 people  [SEP]  PARIS (AP) — French anti-terrorism forces arrested four people in southern France on Friday, including a 16-year-old girl, and uncovered a makeshift laboratory with the explosive TATP and other base ingredients for fabricating a bomb, the Paris prosecutor’s office said. The prosecutor’s office said around 70 grams of TATP were seized in the home of a 20-year-old man in the Montpellier area, along with a liter each of acetone, oxygenated water and sulfuric acid. TATP, which can be made from readily available materials, was used in the November 2015 attack in Paris and the March 2016 attack in Brussels carried out by Islamic State extremists. Two other men were arrested, a 33-year-old and a 26-year-old, along with the 16-year-old girl, according to the prosecutor’s office, which handles terrorism investigations in France. A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the unfolding investigation, said one of the suspects was believed to be planning a suicide attack but that the investigation had not yet uncovered a specific target.
UN approves watered-down new sanctions against North Korea  [SEP]  UNITED NATIONS | The U.N. Security Council on Monday unanimously approved new sanctions on North Korea but not the toughest-ever measures sought by the Trump administration to ban all oil imports and freeze international assets of the government and its leader, Kim Jong Un. The resolution, responding to Pyongyang’s sixth and strongest nuclear test explosion on Sept. 3, does ban North Korea from importing all natural gas liquids and condensates. It also bans all textile exports and prohibits any country from authorizing new work permits for North Korean workers — two key sources of hard currency for the northeast Asian nation. As for energy, it caps Pyongyang’s imports of crude oil at the level of the last 12 months, and it limits the import of refined petroleum products to 2 million barrels a year. The watered-down resolution does not include sanctions that the U.S. wanted on North Korea’s national airline and the army. Nonetheless, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley told the council after the vote that “these are by far the strongest measures ever imposed on North Korea.” But she stressed that “these steps only work if all nations implement them completely and aggressively.” Haley noted that the council was meeting on the 16th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attack. In a clear message to North Korean threats to attack the U.S., she said: “We will never forget the lesson that those who have evil intentions must be confronted.” “Today we are saying the world will never accept a nuclear armed North Korea,” she said. “We are done trying to prod the regime to do the right thing” and instead are taking steps to prevent it “from doing the wrong thing.” Haley said the U.S. doesn’t take pleasure in strengthening sanctions and reiterated that the U.S. does not want war. “The North Korean regime has not yet passed the point of no return,” she said. “If it agrees to stop its nuclear program it can reclaim its future. If it proves it can live in peace, the world will live in peace with it. … If North Korea continues its dangerous path, we will continue with further pressure.” The final agreement was reached after negotiations between the U.S. and China, the North’s ally and major trading partner. Haley said the resolution never would have happened without the “strong relationship” between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. But its provisions are a significant climb-down from the very tough sanctions the Trump administration proposed last Tuesday, especially on oil, where a complete ban could have crippled North Korea’s economy. The cap on the import of petroleum products could have an impact, but North Korea will still be able to import the same amount of crude oil that it has this year. The textile ban is significant. Textiles are North Korea’s main source of export revenue after coal, iron, seafood and other minerals that have already been severely restricted by previous U.N. resolutions. North Korean textile exports in 2016 totaled $752.5 million, accounting for about one-fourth of its total $3 billion in merchandise exports, according to South Korean government figures. Haley said the Trump administration believes the new sanctions combined with previous measures would ban over 90 percent of North Korea’s exports reported in 2016. As for North Koreans working overseas, the U.S. mission said a cutoff on new work permits will eventually cost North Korea about $500 million a year once current work permits expire. The U.S. estimates about 93,000 North Koreans are working abroad, the U.S. official said. The original U.S. draft would have ordered all countries to impose an asset freeze and travel ban on Kim Jong Un and four other top party and government officials. The resolution adopted Monday adds only one person to the sanctions list — Pak Yong Sik, a member of the Workers’ Party of Korea Central Military Commission, which controls the country’s military and helps direct its military industries. The original U.S. draft would also have frozen the assets of North Korea’s state-owned airline Air Koryo, the Korean People’s Army and five other powerful military and party entities. The resolution adds only the Central Military Commission of the Workers’ Party of Korea and the party’s powerful Organization and Guidance Department and its Propaganda and Agitation Department to the sanctions blacklist. North Korea’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement early Monday saying it was watching the United States’ moves closely and warned that it was “ready and willing” to respond with measures of its own. It said the U.S. would pay a heavy price if the sanctions proposed by Washington are adopted. Britain’s U.N. ambassador, Matthew Rycroft, told reporters who questioned the watering down of the initial U.S. text that “there is a significant prize in keeping the whole of the Security Council united.” Rycroft called the resolution “a very significant set of additional sanctions,” declaring that “we are tightening the screw, and we stand prepared to tighten it further.” French Ambassador Francois Delattre said, “We are facing not a regional but a global threat, not a virtual but an immediate threat, not a serious but an existential threat.” “Make no mistake about it,” he said, “our firmness today is our best antidote to the risk of war, to the risk of confrontation, and our firmness today is our best tool for a political solution tomorrow.” China and Russia had called for a resolution focused on a political solution to the escalating crisis over North Koreas nuclear program. They have proposed a freeze-for-freeze that would halt North Korean nuclear and missile tests in exchange for the U.S. and South Korea stopping their joint military exercises — but the Trump administration has rejected that. China’s U.N. ambassador, Liu Jieyi, said Beijing has been making “unremitting efforts” to denuclearize and maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. Liu again urged the council to adopt the freeze-for-freeze proposal and said talks with North Korea are needed “sooner rather than later.” He expressed hope that the United States will pledge not to seek regime change or North Korea’s collapse. Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia went further, making clear that while Russia supported the resolution, it wasn’t entirely satisfied with the council’s approach. He said the “unwillingness” of the U.S. to reaffirm pledges not to seek regime change or war in North Korea or to include the idea of having U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres use his good offices to try to resolve the dispute “gives rise to very serious questions in our minds.” “We’re convinced that diverting the gathering menace from the Korean Peninsula could be done not through further and further sanctions, but by political means,” he said. The resolution does add new language urging “further work to reduce tensions so as to advance the prospects for a comprehensive settlement.” It retains language reaffirming support for long-stalled six-party talks with that goal involving North Korea, the U.S., Russia, China, Japan and South Korea. South Korea and Japan welcomed the new sanctions, with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe praising “a remarkably tough sanctions resolution.” A presidential spokesman in South Korea said he thinks it’s significant that China and Russia agreed on the measure. Guterres welcomed the council’s “firm action” to send a clear message to North Korea that it must comply with its international obligations, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. Guterres also reaffirmed his commitment to work with all parties to reduce tensions and promote a peaceful political solution “and to strengthening communications channels,” Dujarric said. Associated Press writers Christopher Bodeen in Beijing, Matthew Pennington in Washington and Jennifer Peltz in New York contributed to this report.
Bodies Found In Swiss Glacier Believed To Be Couple Missing Since 1942  [SEP]  On a summer day in August 1942, Swiss couple Marcelin and Francine Dumoulin set off on foot in the Alps. They never returned. Now, two bodies have been discovered in a shrinking glacier by a worker from a ski lift company, according to Swiss media, and they are believed to be the couple who disappeared some 75 years ago. Local police said in a statement that the pair was discovered on Friday at the Tsanfleuron glacier at an elevation of more than 8,500 feet. They appear to be victims of an accident "decades ago," the Valais police said, and were found with a number of objects such as a backpack, a watch and a book.
GoDaddy boots neo-Nazi site after post on protest violence  [SEP]  A leading neo-Nazi website is losing its internet domain host after its publisher posted an article mocking the woman who was killed in a deadly attack at a white nationalist rally in Virginia. GoDaddy tweeted late Sunday night that it has given The Daily Stormer 24 hours to move its domain to another provider because the site has violated the Scottsdale, Arizona-based company's terms of service. GoDaddy spokesman Dan Race said the move was prompted by a post on the site about Heather Heyer, who was killed Saturday when a man plowed his car into a group of demonstrators in Charlottesville. The post called her "fat" and "childless" and said "most people are glad she is dead, as she is the definition of uselessness." "Given their latest article comes on the immediate heels of a violent act, we believe this type of article could incite additional violence, which violates our terms of service," Race said in an emailed statement. Shortly after GoDaddy tweeted its decision, the site posted an article claiming it had been hacked and would be shut down. It wasn't immediately clear if hackers had truly taken over The Daily Stormer or if that was just a prank post from a website known for its trolling tactics. Andrew Anglin, the website's publisher and author of Sunday's post about Heyer, said he couldn't immediately comment Monday on GoDaddy's move. "I don't have time to talk, we're trying to regain control of the site," he said in an email to The Associated Press. GoDaddy isn't The Daily Stormer's host, which means the site's content isn't on the company's servers, according to Race. "Only the domain is with GoDaddy," Race added. Anglin's site takes its name from Der Sturmer, a newspaper that published Nazi propaganda. The site includes sections called "Jewish Problem" and "Race War." The Daily Stormer is infamous for orchestrating internet harassment campaigns carried out by its "Troll Army" of readers. Its targets have included prominent journalists, a Jewish woman who was running for a California congressional seat and Alex Jones, a radio host and conspiracy theorist whom Anglin derided as a "Zionist Millionaire." In April, a Montana woman sued Anglin after her family became the target of another Daily Stormer trolling campaign. Tanya Gersh's suit claims anonymous internet trolls bombarded Gersh's family with hateful and threatening messages after Anglin published their personal information in a post accusing her and other Jewish residents of Whitefish, Montana, of engaging in an "extortion racket" against the mother of white nationalist Richard Spencer The Daily Stormer used a crowdfunding website, WeSearchr, to raise more than $152,000 in donations from nearly 2,000 contributors to help pay for Anglin's legal expenses. Other internet services have taken similar action against The Daily Stormer since Anglin founded it in 2013. In 2015, Anglin said PayPal had permanently banned him from using the service. And he complained in January that a Ukrainian advertising company had banned them, leaving an Australian electrician as the site's only advertiser. Mairs reported from Philadelphia and Kunzelman reported from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Mary Lou McDonald is the new leader of Sinn Féin  [SEP]  MARY LOU MCDONALD has been formally elected as the new leader of Sinn Féin. With only standing room in the packed RDS in Dublin, McDonald received a standing ovation as she said outlined in her own words, her style of leadership and how Sinn Féin must modernise. Laying down her markers as the new leader of the party, she said her key focus going forward is Brexit, the party’s approach to Europe, reconciliation and healing in the North and repealing the Eighth Amendment. Calling Gerry Adams “an inspirational leader” and “a great friend” she said there would be no Good Friday Agreement and no peace process without him. Outlining her own politics and plans for the party under her leadership, she said “now is the time for fresh thinking and bold ideas”. She told the crowd she was ready for the challenge of leadership, and that she would “lead from the front” with new deputy leader Michelle O’Neill. “We must strive to see things from the perspective of others, to walk in their shoes and to reach a deeper understanding of their position,” she said. McDonald said she is ready to take the party forward, hinting that changes in language and tone of the party might need reform. “Now is the time for new leadership. I am ready to lead,” she said, adding that as a ” “proud Dubliner” and a mother, she wants every parent and their children to be “happy, to fulfil their dreams and potential, to never be held back by inequality, disadvantage or discrimination”. “I believe in getting things done. If something is broken you roll up your sleeves and you fix it,” said told the crowd. McDonald said that Sinn Féin is the only party that will build “a United Ireland and a real republic”. She said that the party must “modernise [its] approaches and [its] structures”. “This will mean changes in how we operate,” she said. “We must be open, flexible and enthusiastic in creating space for newer members and for the sharing of new ideas. McDonald said that Sinn Féin would fight the corner of people who struggle “no matter how early they get up”. She said that she respected that belief in the union with Britain is a “core part of the tradition and identity of a substantial section” of people in Northern Ireland. “Irish unity cannot be a crude exercise of simply stitching north to south and returning to business as usual,” she said. “We want a new Ireland, in which rights are guaranteed, cultures respected, and the diversity of our identities embraced.” She said there was “no single historical narrative” and that there is “no value in re-fighting the battles of the past” or “engaging in the blame game”. Towards the end of the speech, McDonald referenced the upcoming Eighth Amendment referendum, and said that Sinn Féin will “campaign enthusiastically for repeal”. “We will be on the airwaves vigorously arguing our case for repeal,” she said. “Some people will not share our analysis. I respect their right to hold that view. She closed the speech by saying that a new chapter on the road to the republic has begun. “We are the generation of republicans who will see the rising of the moon,” she said, quoting from the old Irish ballad and the prison diary of Bobby Sands. “Sinn Féin in government both North and South.

Government Shuts Down As Congress Fails To Pass Funding Measure  [SEP]  Updated at 1:28 a.m. ET The federal government is now in a partial shutdown after Congress failed to pass a stopgap measure to keep funding going ahead of a midnight deadline. It's an unprecedented situation given that shutdowns usually happen in times of divided government. But this is the first time it's happened with one party controlling both Congress and the White House. Since most government offices won't open again until Monday, there is time over the weekend for legislators to reach a compromise, and House members have been kept in Washington, D.C., in case that happens. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced early Saturday that he will be offering an amendment to change the proposed funding bill from a four-week timeframe to three weeks, meaning it would extend funding through Feb. 8 instead of Feb. 16. The three-week proposal has been championed by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., since Friday evening. Graham had opposed the longer measure for four weeks of funding which passed in the House Thursday but failed in the Senate early Saturday morning, just after the shutdown took effect. Throughout the evening Friday, Graham's proposal for a shorter timeframe of stopgap funding seemed to be picking up steam with senators even as the chamber failed to pass the House measure and failed to reach any larger deal on a number of issues that have been under consideration relating to spending levels, immigration and border security. At midnight, talks among Senate leaders were still happening on the Senate floor after a procedural vote late Friday lacked the 60 yes votes needed to advance the House's four-week funding bill. Around 12:15 a.m. ET, McConnell voted no on the House measure, doing so for procedural reasons that allowed him to the preserve the ability to bring up a substitute bill later. The final vote was 50-49, with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz, absent from the vote. The apparent congressional paralysis risked overshadowing the first anniversary of President Trump's inauguration and capped off a year defined at times by chaos and frustration from both the White House and congressional Republicans despite their unified control of Washington. And it comes after days of hurried negotiations to find a compromise failed, leading to finger-pointing from both parties eager to shift the blame to the other side. Republicans and McConnell had been angling for a four-week continuing resolution, that included extending the popular Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for six years in an effort to entice Democrats to vote for the insurance program they want to fund. But Democrats and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., pushed to include an immigration measure that would include a pathway to citizenship for roughly 700,000 immigrants enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program the Trump administration rescinded last year. Democrats wanted a pathway to citizenship for those roughly 700,000 immigrants who were in the country illegally after being brought here as children. Republicans blamed Democrats for angling for the DACA legislative fix over keeping the government open, using the hashtag #SchumerShutdown and launching an accompanying website focused on Schumer. Shortly before midnight, the White House released a statement blasting Democrats as "obstructionist losers." "Senate Democrats own the Schumer Shutdown. Tonight, they put politics above our national security, military families, vulnerable children, and our country's ability to serve all Americans. We will not negotiate the status of unlawful immigrants while Democrats hold our lawful citizens hostage over their reckless demands. This is the behavior of obstructionist losers, not legislators," White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said. "When Democrats start paying our armed forces and first responders we will reopen negotiations on immigration reform. During this politically manufactured Schumer Shutdown, the President and his Administration will fight for and protect the American people." Trump has canceled plans to travel to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida over the weekend, where he was set to have a gala fundraiser Saturday to commemorate his inauguration one year ago. Just after midnight, McConnell took the Senate floor to put fault on Democrats for not backing the House bill and averting a shutdown. "What we have just witnessed on the floor was a cynical decision to shove aside millions of Americans for the sake of irresponsible political gains," the GOP leader said. "A government shutdown was 100 percent avoidable, completely avoidable. Now it is imminent all because Senate Democrats chose to filibuster a noncontroversial funding bill that contains nothing — not a thing — that they do not support." However, the hashtag #TrumpShutdown was also trending on Twitter late Friday night, and Democrats believe that it's Republicans who will end up shouldering the majority of blame from the public given the GOP controls both Congress and the White House. Trump appeared to complicate efforts to reach a compromise over the past weeks, at first signaling he would sign any immigration deal but then rejecting a bipartisan proposal, bending to his conservative, hardline base and insisting any deal had to have funding for his trademark border wall. And negotiations further stalled after Trump reportedly used a vulgarity in questioning why the U.S. should welcome immigrants from Africa instead of places like Norway. (Trump has denied that he used that language.) Schumer took to the Senate floor immediately after McConnell early Saturday and said that when he met with Trump at the White House Friday, he had even put the border wall on the negotiating table in order to reach a compromise on DACA. But "even that was not enough to entice the president to finish the deal," Schumer said, accusing Trump and Republicans of "rooting for a shutdown" which would "crash entirely" on the president's shoulders. "What happened to the president who asked us to come out with a deal and promised he'd take heat for it? What happened to that president? He backed off at the first sign of pressure," Schumer said. "The same chaos, the same disarray, the same division and discord on the Republican side that's been in the background of these negotiations for months unfortunately appears endemic." Polling released Friday from both Washington Post/ABC News and CNN found that most Americans would blame Trump and Republicans over Democrats in the event a shutdown occurred. However, CNN also found a majority said approving a budget deal was more important than finding a way to advance DACA. As NPR's Brian Naylor reported, if the shutdown continues, essential services will continue and essential workers would remain on the job, though unpaid. Active duty military will be unaffected, along with postal services. In a change from the last time the government shut down in October 2013, the Interior Department announced it will work to keep national parks open and "as accessible as possible."
Powerful cyclone slams into Australia's tropical north east  [SEP]  A powerful cyclone has slammed into Australia's tropical north east coast, tearing down fences, snapping trees and knocking out power to thousands. The destructive eyewall of Cyclone Debbie, a Category 4 storm packing winds up to 160mph, made landfall near Airlie Beach, a resort town in Queensland, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology said. The town is starting point for trips to the Whitsunday Islands, a popular tourist destination which has been pummelled by fierce winds that damaged roofs and knocked down palm trees. Officials warned that the slow-moving storm is likely to hover over the region for several hours before weakening as it moves inland. Queensland Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said the cyclone's slow pace had created a "battering ram effect", with some areas enduring the howling winds and drenching rains for a long time. Communities along more than 200 miles of coastline are expected to be impacted, he said. "I suspect before the day is out, we will see a lot of structural damage in the cyclone's path," Mr Stewart said. John Collins, a member of the Whitsundays government council, was sheltering from the storm with his wife and four daughters inside their house in Proserpine, a town south of Airlie Beach. He could see that four of his neighbours' sheds had been destroyed and every house within eyesight - including his own - had lost their fences. At least four trees had been smashed to pieces. "It sounds like you got a jumbo jet sitting on the roof of your house," Mr Collins said by telephone of the wind roaring outside. "It really is so loud. It's incredible." His wife and two of their daughters were so scared they were hiding under blankets. Meanwhile, one of his other daughters - whom he described as "a real weather nerd" - was enthralled with the storm, and was diligently listening to the radio for updates. The family's power had been out since Tuesday morning, and they were resigned to several more hours of waiting until it was safe to emerge from the house. "It's just going on and on and on," he said. Thousands of people evacuated low-lying areas in the storm's path on Monday. Hundreds of schools were closed on Tuesday and more than 20,000 households were without power by mid-afternoon. "Conditions have deteriorated rapidly," prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said in an address to Parliament. "Take care and stay safe. Be prepared to shelter in place until Wednesday." The storm poses a serious threat to the farming region's crops. The area produces a wide range of fruits and vegetables, including tomatoes, mangoes and peppers.
Canadian diplomat in Cuba suffered hearing loss along with U.S. officials  [SEP]  WASHINGTON — The Canadian government said Thursday that at least one Canadian diplomat in Cuba also has been treated for hearing loss following disclosures that a group of American diplomats in Havana suffered severe hearing loss that U.S. officials believe were caused by an advanced sonic device. Global Affairs Canada spokeswoman Brianne Maxwell said Canadian officials “are aware of unusual symptoms affecting Canadian and U.S. diplomatic personnel and their families in Havana. The government is actively working — including with U.S. and Cuban authorities - to ascertain the cause.” Maxwell added that officials don’t have any reason to believe Canadian tourists and other visitors could be affected. Canada helped broker talks between Cuba and the United States that led to restored diplomatic relations. In the fall of 2016, a series of U.S. diplomats began suffering unexplained losses of hearing, according to officials with knowledge of the investigation into the case. Several of the diplomats were recent arrivals at the embassy, which reopened in 2015 as part of President Barack Obama’s reestablishment of diplomatic relations with Cuba. Some of the U.S. diplomats’ symptoms were so severe that they were forced to cancel their tours early and return to the United States, officials said. After months of investigation, U.S. officials concluded that the diplomats had been attacked with an advanced sonic weapon that operated outside the range of audible sound and had been deployed either inside or outside their residences. It was not immediately clear if the device was a weapon used in a deliberate attack, or had some other purpose. The U.S. officials weren’t authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the U.S. retaliated by expelling two Cuban diplomats from their embassy in Washington on May 23. She did not say how many U.S. diplomats were affected or confirm they had suffered hearing loss, saying only that they had “a variety of physical symptoms.” The Cuban government said in a lengthy statement late Wednesday that “Cuba has never permitted, nor will permit, that Cuban territory be used for any action against accredited diplomatic officials or their families, with no exception.” The statement from the Cuban Foreign Ministry said it had been informed of the incidents on Feb. 17 and had launched an “exhaustive, high-priority, urgent investigation at the behest of the highest level of the Cuban government.” It said the decision to expel two Cuban diplomats was “unjustified and baseless.” The ministry said it had created an expert committee to analyze the incidents and had reinforced security around the U.S. embassy and U.S. diplomatic residences. “Cuba is universally considered a safe destination for visitors and foreign diplomats, including U.S. citizens,” the statement said. U.S. officials told The Associated Press that about five diplomats, several with spouses, had been affected and that no children had been involved. The FBI and Diplomatic Security Service are investigating. Cuba employs a state security apparatus that keeps many people under surveillance and U.S. diplomats are among the most closely monitored people on the island. Like virtually all foreign diplomats in Cuba, the victims of the incidents lived in housing owned and maintained by the Cuban government. However, officials familiar with the probe said investigators were looking into the possibilities that the incidents were carried out by a third country such as Russia, possibly operating without the knowledge of Cuba’s formal chain of command. Nauert said investigators did not yet have a definitive explanation for the incidents but stressed they take them “very seriously,” as shown by the Cuban diplomats’ expulsions. “We requested their departure as a reciprocal measure since some U.S. personnel’s assignments in Havana had to be curtailed due to these incidents,” she said. “Under the Vienna Convention, Cuba has an obligation to take measures to protect diplomats.” U.S. diplomats in Cuba said they suffered occasional harassment for years after the restoration of limited ties with the communist government in the 1970s, harassment reciprocated by U.S. agents against Cuban diplomats in Washington. The use of sonic devices to intentionally harm diplomats would be unprecedented. Gillies reported from Toronto and Weissenstein reported from Havana.
Amid thaw, Macedonia and Greece to restart direct flights  [SEP]  The two neighbors were at odds for nearly three decades over the Macedonia's name. Athens claims it implies territorial aspirations on its adjoining province of Macedonia, and on ancient Greek heritage.
Activists: At least 17 killed in east Syria airstrikes  [SEP]  BEIRUT — Syrian activists say at least 17 civilians have been killed in a series of airstrikes on a Euphrates River crossing in eastern Syria. Omar Abou Leila of the monitoring group DeirEzzor 24 says Russian jets struck on Sunday ferries waiting to transport passengers across the river in the Islamic State group-held town of al-Baloul, 27 kilometres (17 miles) east of the contested city of Deir el-Zour. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights puts the toll at 21 civilians killed. It says the Russian air force is responsible. It was not immediately possible to independently confirm the claim. Russian-backed government forces and U.S.-backed non-government forces are in a race to claim the IS-held river valley, and the surrounding energy resources and nearby crossing to Iraq.
Gottemoeller: US deployments in Central, Eastern Europe 'proportionate response' to Russia  [SEP]  The deployment of U.S. tanks and fighting vehicles to Central and Eastern Europe is a proportionate response to Russia's aggressive actions toward the Baltic states and NATO as a whole, the alliance's Deputy Secretary General Rose Gottemoeller told BNS during a visit to Lithuania. Gottemoeller said in an interview with BNS that NATO was concerned about the continued build-up of Russian forces and Moscow's actions in Ukraine, but it did not see an immediate threat for its member states. According to the deputy secretary general, there was no plan for U.S. armor to return to Europe prior to Russia's seizure of Crime and threatening behavior toward the Baltic states and NATO as a whole. "I do want to emphasize that it is proportionate and measured, because I've seen some of the Russian reporting that this is a hurried operation, that this is somehow also bringing a lot of armor back to Europe, but in truth it's 3,500 personnel, 87 tanks and 144 Bradley fighting vehicles," she said regarding the recent military buildup in Europe. NATO has "some interest in dialogue in terms of seeking reassurance from the Russians about what they are doing, seeking information from them about what they are doing," Gottemoeller commented. "There is a mutual aspect to this," she continued. "Russia says they are concerned about what NATO is doing, so we should be able to brief each other in that context about our activities as well, whether it is Operation Atlantic Resolve or what is going on in the European Reassurance Initiative." The deputy secretary general found that these were all legitimate possibilities for future dialogue, "...but we in NATO need to be very clear-eyed about our own interest in this regard, and I think the core interest we have is to reduce risks such as we've seen in the Baltic region with airspace incidents — those types of things. We want to reduce risks so that we do not have the possibility of a crisis emerging that could possibly escalate into conflict. Nobody wants that; it's not in anybody's interest."
Trump’s travel ban again blocked, this time by 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  [SEP]  The ruling Monday from a unanimous three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals deals the administration another legal defeat as the Supreme Court considers a separate case on the issue. The judges say the president violated U.S. immigration law by discriminating against people based on their nationality and that Trump failed to show their entry into the country would hurt American interests. They didn’t rule on whether the travel ban violated the Constitution’s ban on the government officially favoring or disfavoring any religion. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Virginia also ruled against the travel ban May 25. The administration has appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court.
For Tunisian Jews, Firebomb Attacks on Synagogue Open Old Scars  [SEP]  Legend has it that the El Ghriba synagogue in Djerba, a small island town just off the coast of Tunisia, has roots going back to the Babylonian Exile. The kohanim, the rumor goes, wanting to preserve the parts of the Beit HaMikdash that they could carry, lugged a door and a stone from Jerusalem to Djerba to establish it as a Diaspora outpost. The current building was erected in the 19th century, and most historians peg the original structure as being around 2,000 years old, but the myth has persisted anyway, and each year, Jews from the around the world make a Lag B’Omer pilgrimage to El Ghriba, often described as the oldest synagogue in Africa. Amid violent protests against over government austerity and the rising cost of living, bombs were thrown into the synagogue, as well as two Jewish schools in the town, earlier this week, a community representative told a Tunisian news outlet. El Ghriba sustained damages, but neither of the schools did. No one was hurt. Elie Trabelsi, the son of the synagogue’s president, Pérez Trabelsi, took to Facebook to spread the news: “There was a failed attempt to burn down a synagogue in the Jewish Quarter of Djerba through the use of Molotov cocktails, but thank God, no one was hurt and security and civil protection are now doing their duty.” As of now, the bombings don’t seem to be connected to the content of the protests, but rather, were the work of opportunistic arsonists who took advantage of the thinly spread government security forces. “These acts were carried out at night and have nothing to do with the ongoing protests,” the ministry’s spokesman, Khalifa Chibani, told a Tunisian news outlet. The Tunisian embassy did not respond to requests for comment. El Ghriba has, regrettably, seen worse: In 1985, a policeman charged with watching over the Simchat Torah celebration opened fire on the revelers, killing three, and in 2002, a suicide bomber who was eventually traced to al-Qaeda blew himself up in a truck outside the synagogue and killed 21. Before that attack, up to 8,000 travelers would come to Djerba, home of one of the most unique sects of Judaism in the world. The number is now in the low hundreds, and in 2011, during the Arab Spring, the event was canceled altogether. The history of Jews in Tunisia is one of the odder collections of up’s and down’s you can find, and I encourage anyone to go and spend a little time researching it. In 1956, just before Tunisia wrested independence from France, 100,000 Jews called the country home; today, there are around 2,000, 700 of them in Djerba. Tunisia has been home to everyone from Max Azria, founder of the global clothing brand BCBGMAXAZRIA, to Victor Perez, a world champion flyweight boxer who died in a death march between Nazi sub-camps (not to mention an Israeli Supreme Court justice, a Chief Rabbi of France, and two cartoonists killed in the Charlie Hebdo shootings). It’s a history of insulation from dominant forms of Judaism that has resulted in a very specific brand of Sephardi ritual, and of being violently subject to the ever-changing whims of the government. Here’s to hoping this is just another chapter, and not the last. Jesse Bernstein is a former Intern at Tablet.
Fugitive ex-Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is detained by police in Germany  [SEP]  BARCELONA, Spain — Fugitive former Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is being held by German police on a Spanish arrest warrant after trying to cross into Germany from Denmark. His lawyer, Jaume Alonso-Cuevillas, confirmed to The Associated Press that German police stopped Puigdemont on Sunday when he was crossing the border. He says Puigdemont is at a police station. Alonso-Cuevillas says Puigdemont was on his way back to Belgium where he has been staying since fleeing Spain following a failed bid by his regional government in October to declare independence from Spain. The German news agency dpa reported that the criminal investigation office of the northern German state of Schlewsig-Holstein confirmed Puigdemont’s arrest. A Spanish Supreme Court judge reactivated an international arrest warrant for Puigdemont on Friday when he was visiting Finland. Arrest warrants have also been issued for five other Catalan separatists. • Catalonia braced for violence as Spanish judge orders seizure of medieval treasures
Putin says Russia ditching dollar in sanctions response  [SEP]  President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that Russia had no choice but to cut its dependency on dollars to conduct trade, after becoming the target of increasingly severe US sanctions. "It isn't our goal to desert the dollar," Putin told an investment forum in comments broadcast on national television. "The dollar is deserting us." The dollar is the preeminent currency in international trade. Washington has made it difficult for some targets of its sanctions to use the currency. "Those who are taking such decisions are not shooting themselves in the foot, but a bit higher," Putin said to laughter from the crowd. Worries about the ability to use the dollar will push other countries to seek alternatives, said Putin. Russian authorities have long talked about "de-dolarisation" of its international trade. "We need to do it and I assure you we will do it," said Putin. However, progress on that front has been slow. Oil, Russia's major export, is priced in dollars. Nevertheless, much of Russia's trade with its ex-Soviet neighbours is in rubles, and Putin noted the country recently sold its S-400 surface-to-air missile batteries to Turkey without dollars featuring in the transaction. Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov recently said India will pay for its S-400s in rubles. Russia and China have also indicated they want to increase the use of the ruble and yuan in their bilateral trade. Russia has been hit by several rounds of sanctions by Washington and the European Union since Moscow's intervention in Ukraine in 2014.
Bolton meets with SKorea, Japan national security advisers  [SEP]  WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump’s new national security adviser held talks Thursday with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts, as the U.S. gears up for an unprecedented summit with North Korea. John Bolton met with Chung Eui-yong, the South Korean official who last month announced outside the White House Trump’s surprise decision to meet with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un. The summit is slated for May or June. South Korea’s president is due to meet Kim this month. Bolton met separately Thursday with Shotaro Yachi of Japan whose prime minister will meet Trump at the White House on Tuesday. A spokesman at the National Security Council says Chung and Yachi are the first national security advisers to meet with Bolton since he took office on Monday.

Boiler explosion at St. Louis box plant kills three, injures four  [SEP]  April 4, 2017 by Jim Suhr, The Associated Press KANSAS CITY, Mo.—An explosion launched a van-sized boiler through the roof a St. Louis box company and slammed much of it down onto a laundry business across the street on April 4, killing three people and injuring four others, authorities said. One person died in the blast about 8 a.m. at the Loy-Lange Box Co. and two others were killed when a large piece of the boiler crashed into the nearby Faultless Healthcare Linen building’s office area, Fire Chief Dennis Jenkerson said. The explosion appears to have been an accident, but investigators were trying to pinpoint what caused the cast iron boiler—estimated to weigh a ton to a ton and a half—to explode, Jenkerson said. The blast occurred in a largely industrial area of south St. Louis. Two injured victims were in critical condition, and one was undergoing surgery, Jenkerson said. The injured include a linen company worker who was found pinned beneath the boiler, which Jenkerson said was roughly 4 feet in diameter and 10 feet long (1.2 metres in diameter and 3 metres long). The boiler was used to produce steam to power the box company’s equipment. The boiler was still hot when rescuers arrived, the fire chief said, noting that the equipment travelled up to 500 feet (150 metres). Though none of the victims’ names has been released, Faultless Healthcare Linen’s chief operating officer, Mark Spence, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch the three victims there were new hires who were filling out paperwork when the boiler came crashing down on them, killing two and injuring the third. “It’s emotionally overwhelming just to think what these poor people experienced,” Spence said. A third building was damaged when a piece of pipe—about 8 feet (2.5 metres) long—linked to the explosion went through its roof, Jenkerson said. Other debris was found on the street. Investigators will seek out and review the boiler’s inspection and maintenance records, though “it appears just to be a commercial accident,” Jenkerson said. Investigators from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration were on the scene. It wasn’t immediately clear if anyone was working on the boiler at the time of the blast. The phone rang unanswered at Loy-Lange Box Co., and an email message from The Associated Press to the company wasn’t returned. The company is described on its website as a “full-service corrugator and custom box manufacturer.” —Associated Press reporters Margaret Stafford and Heather Hollingsworth contributed to this report from Kansas City
US State Dept Claims To Have Proof Assad Was Behind Chemical Attack – But It’s Classified  [SEP]  The US State Department claims to have proof that the Syrian government was behind the alleged chemical attack in Douma last weekend. However, they have refused to make the evidence public because the intelligence is “classified.” RT reports: State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said on Friday that the US has “a very high level of confidence” that it was the Syrian government that launched an alleged chemical weapons attack on civilians in Douma on April 7. Asked by AP’s Matt Lee if the US can say that it has clear evidence of the Syrian government’s culpability, Nauert responded that while she cannot speak for other nations, “it’s the assessment of the British government, the US government, the French government” that Syria was the culprit. “I cannot speak on their behalf, but we’ve all have been having conversations and sharing information, intelligence included, and we can say that the Syrian government was behind the attack,” Nauert said. The US assertion relies on “different kind of sources,” including those of its own, she said. It’s unclear if the strongest-worded attribution of blame by the US so far is based on some newly uncovered evidence. Pressed on whether Washington had obtained some new proof that explicitly points at Damascus’ role in the incident, Nauert did not provide any new details, saying that she is not in a position to divulge the intelligence data. She went on to criticize “some TV shows” that are calling on the White House to offer some facts in support of the accusations: “a lot of this stuff is classified at this point. We are unable to provide all of this publicly at this moment,” she said. At the same time, Nauert admitted that the US has, so far, failed to independently determine what substance was used in the alleged chemical attack. “On Tuesday, when we last met, I talked how we know that it was a chemical weapon that was used in Syria. The exact kind or the mix of that [chemical weapon] we are still looking into.” At a briefing on Tuesday, Nauert said: “we do know that some sort of a substance was used.” She also dismissed the statement by the Russian Defense Ministry that the UK government could have pressured the rebel-linked White Helmets group, which was the primary source of the photos and videos from the site of the supposed attack, to stage a provocation in Douma. On Thursday, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov said that Moscow has “evidence that Britain had a direct involvement in arranging this provocation in Eastern Ghouta.” The UK rebuffed the accusations, calling them “grotesque.” Nauert echoed an earlier statement by White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who said on Friday that Washington has “a very high confidence that Syria was responsible,” while accusing Russia of a “failure” to head off the alleged attack.
Woman arrested on suspicion of murdering eight babies in Chester hospital  [SEP]  A female healthcare worker has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of eight babies and the attempted murder of another six after an investigation of the neonatal unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital. The arrest comes as part of a long-running investigation following a high number of baby deaths at the hospital. Detectives launched an investigation in May last year, initially looking at the deaths of 15 babies between June 2015 and June 2016. On Tuesday police said they had made an arrest and the probe had widened. Detectives said they are looking into the deaths of 17 babies and 15 non-fatal collapses between March 2015 and July 2016. Police have not said if the arrested woman is a nurse, doctor or other health professional. Detective Inspector Paul Hughes, in charge of the investigation for Cheshire Police, said: "The investigation into the neonatal unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital is continuing. "Since it was first launched in May 2017, a dedicated team of detectives have been working tirelessly on this case. "This is a highly complex and very sensitive investigation and, as you can appreciate, we need to ensure we do everything we possibly can to try to establish in detail what has led to these baby deaths and collapses. "When the investigation was first launched it was focusing on the deaths of 15 babies that occurred between the period of June 2015 and June 2016. "In addition the investigation was also conducting a review of six non-fatal collapses during the same period. "Since the start of our inquiries and as the information gathering process has continued, the scope of the investigation has now widened. We are now currently investigating the deaths of 17 babies and 15 non-fatal collapses between the period of March 2015 and July 2016. "Due to the nature of the case and as part of our ongoing inquiries, we have consulted with a number of medical specialists to ensure that we carry out as thorough an investigation as possible. We have also spoken to a large number of people to gather as much information as we can. "As a result of our ongoing inquiries we have today arrested a healthcare professional in connection with the investigation. "She was arrested earlier this morning on suspicion of murder in relation to eight of the babies and attempted murder in relation to six of the babies and is currently in custody. "Whilst this is a significant step forward in our inquiries it is important to remember that the investigation is very much active and ongoing at this stage. "There are no set timescales for this coming to a conclusion but we remain committed to carrying out a thorough investigation as soon as possible. "We recognise that this investigation has a huge impact on all of the families, staff and patients at the hospital as well as members of the public. "Parents of all the babies are continuing to be kept fully updated and are being supported throughout the process by specially trained officers." The hospital carried out a number of independent expert medical reviews into the deaths before calling in police. Medical director Ian Harvey said: "We are continuing to support Cheshire Police with their ongoing investigation. "Asking the police to look into this was not something we did lightly, but we need to do everything we can to understand what has happened here and get the answers we and the families so desperately want. "The Countess is now equivalent to a Level 1 special care baby unit and we are confident the unit is safe to continue in its current form." A report published in July 2016 by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) found significant gaps in medical and nursing rotas and insufficient staffing for the provision of longer term high dependency and some intensive care.
International Yoga Day: Indo-Tibetan Border police performs Yoga at -25 degree temperature in Ladakh | Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis  [SEP]  The ITBP personnel also celebrated yoga at various locations across India. Joining the nation in celebrating the third edition of International Yoga Day, the Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) force on Wednesday performed yoga at nearly 18000 feet above the sea level in Ladakh at biting -25 degree Celsius. The ITBP personnel also celebrated yoga at various locations across India, including Himachal Pradesh's Kullu, Chhattisgarh's Rajnandgaon District, Uttarakhand's Uttarkashi district. Indian Navy Chief Admiral Sunil Lanba also preformed Yoga in New Delhi. Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the International Yoga Day celebrations in Lucknow. The entire world has been equally thrilled and pumped up to observe the occasion, taking a pledging to keep their body, mind and soul fit. The age-old Indian practice has brought people from different cultures and countries together and this could be clearly seen from the zeal and enthusiasm with which the people across the globe are practicing yoga. Prime Minister Modi while addressing the gathering on this day in Uttar Pradesh's Lucknow said that Yoga has become an integral part of every Indian household. Conveying his greetings to all those who joined the Yoga Day 2017 celebrations across India and the world, Prime Minister Modi said Yoga's immense popularity outside India is high and has connected the world with India. "I am happy to see so many Yoga institutes being opened over the last three years. Demand for Yoga teachers is increasing. Apart from fitness, wellness is important. Yoga is a medium to achieve wellness," Prime Minister Modi said. The international day for yoga is celebrated annually since its inception in 2015. An International day for Yoga was declared unanimously by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on 11 December 2014.
Manhunt underway for person of interest in shooting of 2 police officers, civilian  [SEP]  A manhunt is underway for a person of interest in the North Dallas shooting that injured two police officers and a civilian at a Home Depot, authorities said.911 dispatchers received a call to go to the Home Depot shortly after 4:12 p.m., Dallas Police Chief Renee Hall said in a press conference Tuesday night. After the responding officers arrived, a subsequent call for assistance was made after the shooting began.Two Dallas Police officers were critically wounded, the Dallas Police Department posted on Twitter shortly after the shooting. A civilian who is a loss prevention officer for Home Depot was also shot, Hall said. His or her condition is unknown at this time, police said.Police were actively searching for the person of interest in a nearby wooded area on Tuesday afternoon. Authorities identified him as 29-year-old Armando Juarez, who possibly left the location in a white pickup truck.Juarez is to be considered and dangerous, Hall said, adding that it is unclear "how he was able to get a gun and shoot all three of the victims."Hall asked the community to contact police if they see Juarez or have any information on who and where he is.The officers were transported by the Dallas Fire-Rescue Department to the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, where they are getting the "best possible care," Hall said.Hall did not release their names or an update on their conditions when speaking to the media out of respect for the families, she said.Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings described the aftermath of the shooting as a "two-front battle," referring to the victims' battles for their lives at the hospital as well as "the battle out in the community" to find the person of interest.The police department asked for prayers for the victims and their families."I want to ask each and every one of you for your prayers ... for our officers, for their families and for our entire DPD family, because we need you right now," Hall said. "Our hearts are very heavy."State, local and federal law enforcement agencies responded to the scene.In 2016, five Dallas law enforcement officers were shot and killed and seven more injured after they were ambushed by 25-year-old former Army reservist Micah Xavier Johnson . Johnson later died in a standoff with police.Former Dallas Police Chief and ABC News contributor David Brown said the most recent shooting on two Dallas police officers is "too much to bear for one department in such a short time frame.""Once again, it sobers us to realize what officers walk into day in and day out, how quickly they can become victims," Rawlings said.
Lieutenant governors from around US meeting in New Orleans  [SEP]  Lieutenant governors from around US meeting in New Orleans NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Lieutenant governors from around the United States are gathering in New Orleans for a three-day meeting. Louisiana Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser will welcome the 2018 annual meeting of the National Lieutenant Governors Association with opening remarks Wednesday morning. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell also will greet the group. The group's website says it was organized in 1962 as a professional association for elected officials who are first in line of succession to the governors of 50 states and five U.S. territories. The agenda for the meeting that begins Wednesday includes panel discussions on tourism and best practices in emergency management. A discussion also is set on the importance of Louisiana's five Mississippi River ports and its seafood industry to other parts of the nation.
New York to become first state to offer tuition-free college for middle class  [SEP]  NEW YORK — New York just became the first state in the nation to make tuition free for middle class students at both two- and four-year public colleges. Governor Andrew Cuomo introduced the tuition-free plan in January. Lawmakers agreed to include it in the state budget, which was approved by the Assembly on Saturday and by the Senate late Sunday night. The governor is expected to sign the budget bills. Tuition will be free for residents who earn up to a specific income cap, which will be phased in over the first three years. Starting this fall, undergraduate students who attend a State University of New York or City University of New York school will be eligible for the Excelsior Scholarship if their families earn no more than $100,000 a year. The income cap will lift to $110,000 next year and will reach $125,000 in 2019. Those eligible will pay nothing for tuition, which costs $6,470 annually at four-year schools and about $4,350 a year at community colleges. But they will still be on the hook for the cost of fees and room and board if they live on campus. Those other expenses can add up to $14,000 a year. Students must take 30 credits a year to receive the scholarship. Some lawmakers had spoken out against this requirement, because it excludes students who enroll part time. In the final proposal, Cuomo said the credit requirement is “flexible” so that any student facing hardship will be able to pause and restart the program, or take fewer credits one semester than another. After they graduate, students who receive the scholarship must live and work in New York for the same number of years they received funding. If they leave the state, their scholarship will be converted into a loan. This requirement was not included in the governor’s initial proposal. “Today, college is what high school was — it should always be an option even if you can’t afford it,” Governor Cuomo said in a statement. His office has estimated the scholarship will cost $163 million in the first year, but some lawmakers say that’s lowballing it. An estimated 200,000 students would be eligible once the program is fully implemented. The scholarship is structured to fill in the gap after accounting for other federal and state grants. Nearly half of full-time SUNY students, and more than 60% of those at CUNY, already pay nothing for tuition because of need-based federal Pell Grants or New York Tuition Assistance grants. Those students would not be eligible for the Excelsior Scholarship. SUNY Chairman Carl McCall and Chancellor Nancy Zimpher applauded the budget deal in a statement released by the school, calling the plan “truly ground-breaking.” But they also said they had “hoped for additional support,” especially for SUNY community colleges, which they expect to have more students because of the scholarship. Some Republican lawmakers criticized the governor’s proposal during budget negotiations for excluding students at private colleges. The final budget includes an additional $19 million to create a new financial assistance program for private school students whose families make under the income cap, according to the governor. Those students would get a maximum award of $3,000. Colleges that participate would have to match that funding and agree to not raise the student’s tuition during her enrollment. Tennessee, Oregon, and the city of San Francisco have recently made tuition free at community colleges for all residents, regardless of income. But New York will be the first state to make tuition free for some residents at four-year public colleges. Lawmakers in Rhode Island are considering a similar proposal to make two years of public colleges tuition-free.
Ukraine's leader announces end of 30-day martial law  [SEP]  MOSCOW (AP) — Ukraine's leader has announced an end to the 30-day martial law imposed after Russia seized Ukrainian ships in the Black Sea. Ukraine announced martial law last month after Russian coast guards fired at and seized three Ukrainian ships and their crews. The 24 seamen still remain in Russian custody. The incident is another episode in the long-simmering conflict between the two countries that started in 2014 with Russia's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko's martial law was widely seen as an attempt by the unpopular leader to score political points ahead of next year's presidential election. Poroshenko told the cabinet on Wednesday that Ukraine had boosted its defenses during the 30 days of martial law, which officially expired earlier in the day.
Hill Panels says it's Too Soon to Discuss Immunity for Flynn - The National Herald  [SEP]  WASHINGTON (AP) — Congressional investigators on Friday rebuffed former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s offer of cooperation in exchange for immunity, saying it’s too early in their probe of his Russia connections to discuss a deal. Flynn’s attorney said there were talks about immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony with the congressional committees conducting investigations into Russia’s meddling with the election. A congressional aide confirmed that preliminary discussions with the Senate intelligence committee involved immunity but that it was too early in the investigation to set terms. The aide was not authorized to discuss private conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, of California, said the committee would be discussing the issue with the Senate intelligence committee and the Justice Department. He said that Flynn has even suggested immunity is a significant development. “We should first acknowledge what a grave and momentous step it is for a former national security adviser to the president of the United States to ask for immunity from prosecution,” Schiff said in a statement Friday. Flynn’s attorney, Robert Kelner, said no “reasonable person” with legal counsel would answer questions without assurances that he would not be prosecuted, given calls from some members of Congress that the retired lieutenant general should face criminal charges. “General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit,” Kelner said Thursday. Trump weighed in Friday, tweeting that Flynn “should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!” Flynn’s ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are under investigation by the House and Senate intelligence committees. Both committees are looking into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election and any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin. Since July, the FBI has been conducting a counterintelligence investigation into Russia’s interference in the election and possible coordination with Trump associates. The spokesman for Rep. Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, said there was never an immunity deal offered to Flynn. The committee “had a preliminary conversation with Michael Flynn’s lawyer about arranging for Flynn to speak to the Committee,” Nunes’ spokesman, Jack Langer, said Friday. “The discussions did not include immunity or other possible conditions for his appearance.” Schiff, who has called for Nunes’ recusal from the investigation because of his close ties to the White House, said the committee is interested in Flynn’s testimony, but lawmakers are also “mindful” of the Justice Department’s interests. Congress has the authority to grant someone immunity, but doing so could jeopardize the Justice Department’s ability to use that testimony as the basis for any criminal case it wants to bring. “When the time comes to consider requests for immunity from any witness, we will of course require a detailed proffer of any intended testimony,” Schiff said.\ Kelner released a statement late Thursday after The Wall Street Journal first reported that Flynn’s negotiations with the committee included discussions of immunity. The lawyer described the talks as ongoing and said he would not comment on the details. Four other Trump associates have come forward in recent weeks, saying they would talk to the committees. As of Wednesday, the Senate intelligence committee had asked to interview 20 people as part of the probe. In his statement, Kelner said the political climate in which Flynn is facing “claims of treason and vicious innuendo” is factoring into his negotiations with the committees. “No reasonable person, who has the benefit of advice from counsel, would submit to questioning in such a highly politicized, witch hunt environment without assurances against unfair prosecution,” Kelner said. In September, Flynn weighed in on the implications of immunity on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” criticizing Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her associates in the FBI’s investigation into her use of a private email server. “When you are given immunity, that means that you have probably committed a crime,” Flynn said during the interview. Flynn was fired from his job as Trump’s first national security adviser after it was disclosed that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about a conversation he had with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. during the transition. In the weeks after he resigned, Flynn and his business registered with the Justice Department as foreign agents for $530,000 worth of lobbying work that could have benefited the Turkish government. The lobbying occurred while Flynn was a top Trump campaign adviser. The Turkish businessman who hired Flynn, Ekim Alptekin, has told the AP that Flynn’s firm registered under pressure from the Justice Department.
3 win chemistry Nobel; findings led to best-selling drug  [SEP]  Smith credited others for the work that led to his breakthrough. "Very few research breakthroughs are novel. Virtually all of them build on what went on before. It's happenstance. That was certainly the case with my work," he told The Associated Press. Smith said he learned of the prize in a pre-dawn phone call from Stockholm. "It's a standard joke that someone with a Swedish accent calls and says 'You won!' But there was so much static on the line, I knew it wasn't any of my friends," he said. Winter also ran into phone problems, compounded by what he said was brain-fuzz from a feast at Trinity College Cambridge the night before. "This operator had a Swedish accent," he told a news conference. "It reminded me of my bank ringing up and telling me I had some dodgy transaction on my account ... I was feeling a bit rocky." Dr. Wayne Marasco of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston said the lab technique developed by Smith and Winter was "revolutionary ... and it's used today, every day." Marasco said he uses it daily in his own research on developing therapies that use antibodies, which are disease-fighting proteins in the blood. American Chemical Society president Peter Dorhout praised the Nobel winners, saying "the laureates have used chemistry to accelerate the evolution of natural biological molecules that act as the critical machinery for living organisms. "The breakthroughs from these researchers enable that to occur thousands of times faster than nature to improve medicines, fuels and other products," he said. Winter said an encounter with a cancer patient made him realize the importance of his work. Early in his career he visited a woman who was receiving his then-experimental antibody treatment. Even though Winter didn't know whether the treatment would work, the patient was grateful for whatever extra time it would allow her to spend with her husband. Winter says he realized afterwards there was a "moral imperative" to ensure "what was produced could be used for public benefit." Experts said the winners' discoveries had an ecological benefit. "If you can harness enzymes for your own purposes, this is often more environmentally friendly than using heavy metals or toxic substances to make your chemicals," said Johan Aqvist, a member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry. In other Nobel prizes this year, the medicine prize went Monday to James Allison of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and Tasuku Honjo of Kyoto University, who learned how to release the brakes that cancer can put on the immune system, helping doctors fight many advanced-stage cancer tumours and save an "untold" numbers of lives. Scientists from the United States, Canada and France shared the physics prize Tuesday for revolutionizing the use of lasers in research. Arthur Ashkin became the oldest Nobel Prize laureate at 96, while Donna Strickland of the University of Waterloo in Canada became only the third woman to win a physics Nobel. Strickland had worked with the third winner, Frenchman Gerard Mourou of the Ecole Polytechnique and the University of Michigan. The winner of the Nobel Peace Prize is to be announced Friday and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences will be revealed on Monday. No Nobel literature prize will be awarded this year due to a sex abuse scandal at the Swedish Academy, which chooses the winner. The academy plans to announce both the 2018 and the 2019 winner next year — although the head of the Nobel Foundation has said the body must fix its tarnished reputation first. The man at the centre of the Swedish Academy scandal, Jean-Claude Arnault, a major cultural figure in Sweden, was sentenced Monday to two years in prison for rape.
World’s Oldest Man: Japanese Lumberjack Masazo Nonaka, 112, Takes Title After Previous Record-Holder Dies  [SEP]  The world’s oldest man is now a Japanese lumberjack who was born during the Theodore Roosevelt administration, having taken the title from a 113-year-old Spaniard who died earlier this year, Reuters is reporting. Masazo Nonaka, 112, was born on July 25, 1905. According to The Guinness Book Of World Records, that makes him the oldest living man in the world. It is, of course, possible that there is an older living man somewhere in the world, but his date of birth can’t be confirmed due to lack of reliable records. At a ceremony in Nonaka’s home town of Ashoro, on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, about 560 miles north of Tokyo, the super-centenarian (that’s what’s you call people who exceed 110 years of age) was honored by his community. His granddaughter, Yuko Nonaka, says that Mr. Nonaka gets around pretty well considering his age, according to the Telegraph. Born just after the turn of the century – the 20th century – Nonaka started life as a farmer, then worked as a lumberjack, then managed a hot springs spa that his family owned. The spa remains in his family, and to this day he enjoys frequent baths in the warm waters. In fact, Ms. Nonaka credits those warm baths as at least part of the reason for her grandfather’s long life. She also credits his stress-free lifestyle and delicious sweets, both Japanese and Western — his favorite being strawberry sponge cake. In fact, Japanese people often tend to reach the record books for old age. Part of that credit goes to thorough record-keeping, of course. But researchers also credit the Japanese diet, their penchant for physical exercise, a strong publicly-funded healthcare system, and a reliance on community, for the Japanese tendency to reach exceptionally old age. In fact, Jiroemon Kimura, who died in June 2013 at the age of 116, still holds the record for the longest life ever lived by a human being. In case you were wondering, Mr. Nonaka has lived through four Japanese emperors, 20 U.S. presidents, 10 Popes, five British monarchs, two world wars, and two instances of the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series.

China says won't allow Hong Kong to be used as subversion base  [SEP]  BEIJING: China will not allow anyone to use Hong Kong as a base for subversion against mainland China or to damage its political stability, Beijing's top official in the territory told state television. Chinese leaders are increasingly concerned about a fledgling independence movement in Hong Kong, which returned to mainland rule in 1997 with a promise of autonomy known as "one country, two systems", and recent protests in the city. In an interview with state television broadcast late on Sunday, Zhang Xiaoming, the head of China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, said Beijing will not interfere in matters that purely affect Hong Kong's autonomy. "As far as Hong Kong is concerned, nobody is permitted do anything in any form that damage the country's sovereignty and security, they are not allowed to challenge the central government's authority or that of Hong Kong's Basic Law, they are not allowed to use Hong Kong for infiltration subversion activities against the mainland to damage its social and political stability," Zhang said. China's parliament last month staged a rare interpretation of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution, to effectively bar pro-independence city lawmakers from taking office there. Chinese President Xi Jinping told outgoing Hong Kong Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying last month that China's central government strongly supports efforts by the Hong Kong government to curb moves by some promoting independence for the global financial hub. The former British colony returned to China under the "one country, two systems" agreement that ensured its freedoms and wide-ranging autonomy, including a separate legal system. But Communist Party rulers in Beijing have ultimate control, and some Hong Kong people are concerned they are increasingly interfering to head off dissent.
At least 6 dead, dozens hurt as train derails in western Morocco  [SEP]  At least six people have died and around 72 were injured Tuesday when a train derailed between the Moroccan capital Rabat and the city of Kenitra on the North African country's Atlantic coast, emergency services told EFE. Officials said the death toll was expected to rise given the severity of some of the injuries.
Deadly winter Storm Eleanor sparks fires in Corsica, avalanche alert in the Alps  [SEP]  The French Alps were on maximum avalanche alert Thursday as Storm Eleanor swept through Europe, killing at least four people and fanning rare winter wildfires in Corsica. With the mountains packed with skiiers for the school holidays, major resort Val d'Isère closed its runs for the day because of "heavy snowfall", while Chamonix said it was shutting many of its lifts as a precautionary measure. "The objective is to keep everyone safe," said David Ponson, ski chief in the Alpine Savoie region, as many pistes were shut for a second day. At the other extreme, nearly 400 firefighters on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica were battling two blazes fanned by Eleanor's strong gusts of wind, with three people injured in a fire overnight. Three hundred goats were killed in the blaze at Chiatra-Canale di Verde near the island's east coast and ten homes burnt -- five of them were completely destroyed, local authorities said. The prefecture added that the intensity of the blazes was "exceptional in the middle of winter." Two helicopters were able to help douse the flames after the winds eased up. Eleanor, the fourth winter storm to hit Europe since December, swept into the continent on Wednesday after battering Britain and Ireland. It has left four people dead, including a 21-year-old skiier hit by a falling tree in France and a couple in their 60s swept away on Spain's northern Basque coast by a huge wave. A young man had to be rescued after attempting to save them. On Thursday, firefighters said a woman in her 90s died in Crets-en-Belledonne in the French Alps after the heavy rains caused a nearby stream to overflow its banks, sending a torrent of mud and water into her home. In France, 29 people have been injured -- four of them seriously -- including a woman hit by a falling block of concrete. At Lenk in central Switzerland, eight people were hurt when a violent gust of wind overturned a railway carriage. The whole of Spain's northern coast remained on "orange" alert -- the second highest on a four-point scale -- because of the risk from strong winds and large waves. More than 40 towns in southwestern Spain have meanwhile brought forward their annual Epiphany feast parades -- celebrating the coming of the three wise men with gifts for Jesus -- to Thursday because of heavy rain forecast Friday. The worst of the storm appeared to have passed by Thursday, though much of eastern France was still on "orange" alert for heavy winds, floods and avalanches. Some 29,000 French homes remained without power, a third of them in Corsica. Germany lowered its alert for violent winds Wednesday evening, but high tides were worrying several states, including in the Moselle Valley where heavy downpours have halted boat traffic. The Rhine river was set to surge to seven metres (23 feet) on Thursday and was still rising, the Bild newspaper reported. River traffic will be suspended if it hits 8.3 metres. The storm had snarled air traffic on Wednesday, briefly shutting the Strasbourg and Basel-Mulhouse airports and delaying departures from Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam. It also played havoc with road and rail transport, leaving branches, electrical lines and other debris strewn across tracks and highways. The Eiffel Tower was temporarily closed Wednesday, with the top deck remaining off limits most of the day due to gusts of over 80 kilometres (50 miles) an hour.
Argentine central bank hikes rate to eye-popping 60 percent, peso plunges  [SEP]  BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's central bank yanked its benchmark interest rate up to a dizzying 60 percent on Thursday in a bid to control rampant inflation as the country's currency plummeted 15.8 percent to a record low 40.5 pesos per U.S. dollar. Latin America's third biggest economy is expected to shrink this year, while already-scarce credit has been choked off by increasingly onerous borrowing costs. The central bank raised the rate from 45 percent to combat 12-month inflation running at 31 percent through July. The bank issued a statement saying it called a special meeting of its monetary policy committee, which voted unanimously to hike its key interest rate "in response to the foreign exchange rate situation and the risk of greater inflation." The moves came a day after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) called for the government to institute stronger monetary and fiscal policies in response to the meltdown of the peso. The currency has lost 53.95 percent of its value so far this year, making it the world's worst performing. Despite signing a $50 billion standby financing deal with the IMF earlier this year, President Mauricio Macri is struggling to convince markets that he can spur economic growth while cutting fiscal deficits and combating inflation. "It looks likely that the economy is heading for a hard landing recession over the next 12 months," said Paul Greer, a portfolio manager at the Fidelity Emerging Market Debt Fund. Shares of Argentine export companies that get paid in dollars and benefit from a weak peso drove the local Merval stock index 6 percent higher. But the average yield spread of Argentine sovereign dollar bonds over safe-haven U.S. Treasuries jumped to levels not seen since January 2015. Macri's cabinet chief, Marcos Pena, told reporters on Thursday the government would "find ways to hasten the fiscal tightening process." Argentina has already agreed with the IMF to cut its fiscal deficit from 3.7 percent of gross domestic product last year to 2.7 percent in 2018 and 1.3 percent in 2019. Government spending reductions face opposition from Argentines reeling from cuts in public utility subsidies, a move that has pushed home heating, electricity and water bills higher. The country's biggest labor group, the CGT, and other unions have called for 24- and 36-hour general strikes in late September to protest Macri's belt-tightening measures. The recent slide in the peso was prompted by fears the government may have trouble meeting its 2019 bond obligations. Argentina has $24.9 billion in peso and foreign currency denominated debt payments next year. This story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.

Ms Southern was held by Border Force officials in Coquelles, France, this morning. She was refused entry after it was deemed her presence “was not conducive to the public good”, the Home Office said. Following the decision, Ms Southern wrote on Twitter: “They just locked me out and said "au revoir"... Officially banned from UK for "racism".. doing fine though, all the cool people are being banned anyway.” According to reports, Ms Southern had been planning to meet Austrian Martin Sellner of the Generation Identity group and American commentator Brittany Pettibone in the UK. The pair were also refused entry at Luton airport on Friday. They were removed from the country on Sunday, a Home Office spokeswoman said. The Home Office said they were unable to specify why the trio had been refused entry. However, in a video interview with former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson Mr Sellner said he had planned to appear at Speaker’s Corner in Hyde Park on Sunday. Ms Pettibone had allegedly been planning to interview Mr Robinson. The Home Office spokeswoman said: “Both individuals were refused on policy grounds that their presence in the UK was not conducive to the public good.”
90% of our pilots, co-pilots are Nigerians – Dana Air  [SEP]  Dana Air on Thursday said that 90 per cent of its pilots and co-pilots were Nigerians in line with the Executive Order on Local Content Procurement. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the airline’s Director of Flight Operations, Segun Omole, made the disclosure at the decoration of the five newly-trained pilots and co-pilots in Lagos. Mr. Omole said the airline had boosted its Nigerian pilots from 20 per cent when it started to almost 90 per cent. “When I joined Dana Airline, we were only two captains who were Nigerians while the rest were foreigners, and Dana believed that in the long run, they will have to transfer the management of the office to Nigerians,’’ he said. Mr. Omole said that Dana Air had a total of 33 pilots comprising 16 captains and 17 co-pilots. He said that 27 of them were trained and retrained in 2017 to meet up with the flight standard regulations. “Of course, on the corporate side, it is a very expensive cost to train and retrain pilots every six months, and Dana Air has not shied away from the training,” he said. Mr. Omole said the airline had been training its pilots year in, year out. “We still have seven pilots that are still under training, and about a month from now, we will be doing more decorations,’’ he said. Mr. Omole said the five pilots that were decorated had gone through various flight trainings in and outside the country. He said that three of them were First Officers while the two pilots had been promoted to Captain. According to him, Dana Air remains committed to safety and comfort of its passengers, and will continue to do that by building the capacity of its workforce. While congratulating the pilots, he urged them to maintain the airline’s safety records and serve the best interests of passengers. NAN reports that the trainees are Ayotunde Ilesanmi, Afolabi Damilola, Wahab Lawal, Ibrahim Kazeem and Slyvester Kalu. One of the trainees, Sylvester Kalu, thanked the management on behalf of the trainees for giving them the opportunity to serve the airline better. Mr. Kalu promised that they would always ensure safety standards for the benefit of the airline’s esteemed passengers.
White House communications director resigns amid tensions  [SEP]  The departure of Michael Dubke, Trump's communications director, comes as aides say Trump has grown increasingly frustrated by allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and revelations of possible ties between his campaign and Moscow. "It has been my great honor to serve President Trump and this administration," Dubke wrote in a statement. "It has also been my distinct pleasure to work side-by-side, day-by-day with the staff of the communications and press departments." Dubke's last day has not yet been determined. A Republican consultant, Dubke joined the White House team in February after campaign aide Jason Miller — Trump's original choice for communications director — withdrew from the White House team. Dubke founded Crossroads Media, a GOP firm that specializes in political advertising. Dubke is the latest White House staffer to leave this administration as scrutiny intensifies over contacts Trump staffers may have had with Russian government officials during the campaign and transition period. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told The Associated Press on Tuesday that Dubke resigned before Trump left for his international trip earlier this month, suggesting that his departure is not linked to any pending shake-ups. But his departure raises questions about whether previous Trump loyalists are headed to the White House. Trump has entertained formally bringing back his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and former deputy campaign manager, David Bossie. Bossie told Fox News' "Fox & Friends" that the Trump administration has reached out to him but hasn't offered him a job yet. "They have talked to many people, including me," Bossie said. He later added: "It's an ongoing conversation and that's a fair way to put it." In an interview on Fox News on Tuesday, Conway said Dubke "made very clear that he would see through the president's international trip, and come to work every day and work hard even through that trip because there was much to do here back at the White House." Dubke's hiring was intended to lighten the load on Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, who had also been handling the duties of communications director during Trump's first month in office. Trump has privately pinned some of the blame for his administration's rough start on the White House's communications strategy. While overseas, Trump's longtime lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, joined a still-forming legal team to help the president shoulder the intensifying investigations into Russian interference in the election and his associates' potential involvement. More attorneys with deep experience in Washington investigations are expected to be added, along with crisis communication experts, to help the White House in the weeks ahead. The latest revelations to emerge last week involved Trump's son-in-law and top aide, Jared Kushner. Shortly after the election, Kushner allegedly discussed setting up a secret communications channel with the Russian government to facilitate sensitive discussions about the conflict in Syria. The intent was to connect Trump's chief national security adviser at the time, Michael Flynn, with Russian military leaders, a person familiar with the discussions told the AP. The person wasn't authorized to publicly discuss private policy deliberations and insisted on anonymity. Flynn handed in his resignation in February after it was revealed he misled top White House officials about his contacts with Russian officials. The disclosure of the back channel has put the White House on the defensive. Just back from his nine-day trip to the Middle East and Europe, Trump dismissed recent reports as "fake news."
FBI: Texas Teen Planned Mass Shooting & Bombing  [SEP]  A 17-year-old Texas student was arrested on terrorism charges for a planned mass shooting at a mall in Frisco, Texas. Police said Matin Azizi Yarand had a manifesto and had pledged allegiance to ISIS. It’s also reported the teen, using plans written by Columbine killers Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris was constructing pipe bombs for the attack. According to a report by a CBS news affiliate in Dallas-Ft. Worth, the Plano Independent School District High School student’s plan was foiled by an police undercover operation. Affidavits obtained by the TV news station detail conversations Yarand allegedly had “with an undercover FBI agent while planning a mass shooting at Frisco’s Stonebriar Mall in May.” The station reported Yarand was “arrested for soliciting others to join him on mass shooting spree” but included an affidavit that says he “wanted to be ‘lone wolf’ and spent $1,400 on weapons.”
The Latest: Yemen rebels say strike kills senior official  [SEP]  The Latest: Yemen rebels say strike kills senior official SANAA, Yemen (AP) — The Latest on the conflict in Yemen (all times local): Yemen's Houthi rebels say their acting head of state has been killed in an airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition. The rebels' Supreme Political Council, the highest political body in areas under their control, says Monday that its president, Saleh al-Samad, was killed by the raid in the coastal Hodeida province. The Houthis, Shiite rebels allied with Iran, control much of northern Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa. The coalition has been at war with the rebels since 2015. Yemeni health officials say an airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition in the country's north hit a wedding party, killing at least 15 people the previous day. Khaled al-Nadhri, the top health official in the northern province of Hajja, told The Associated Press on Monday that most of the dead were women and children who were gathered in one of the tents set up for the wedding party in the district of Bani Qayis. He says the bride was also among the dead. Hospital chief Mohammed al-Sawmali says the groom and 45 of the wounded were brought to the local al-Jomhouri hospital. The Saudi-led coalition has been waging a war on Yemen's Shiite rebels known as Houthis, who control much of the north, to restore the internationally recognized government to power.
Defying Russia, Montenegro finally joins NATO  [SEP]  BUDVA, Montenegro (AP) - Once the Balkan stronghold of pro-Russian sentiments, tiny Montenegro is on Monday silently celebrating its entry into NATO in a historic turn that has made the Kremlin furious. Despite the Russian anger and a deep split within the nation of some 620,000 people over the issue, Montenegro is formally becoming the 29th member of the Western military alliance at a ceremony in Washington on Monday. To get there, Montenegro has stood up against its former ally Russia, which has sought to maintain strong historic, political and cultural influence in the Slavic country it considers a special zone of interest. Bringing Montenegro into NATO further diminishes Russia's influence in southeast Europe, and blocks it from the so-called "warm seas" in Europe that could be used as staging grounds for military interventions in the Middle East. The U.S. State Department said Montenegro's membership "will support greater integration, democratic reform, trade, security, and stability with all of its neighbors." Russia has threatened economic and political retaliation, including a campaign to undermine the Montenegrin tourism industry, which relies heavily on Russian visitors. An estimated 200,000 Russians visit Montenegro a year and 80,000 Russians own property here. Russia has also banned imports of Montenegrin wine and recently deported a ranking official from a Moscow airport. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova recently warned potential Russian tourists that "there is an anti-Russian hysteria in Montenegro." "We do not rule out the possibility of provocations, arrests for suspicious reasons or extradition to third countries" of Russians, Zakharova said. Her claim was dismissed by the president of the Russian-speaking diaspora in Montenegro, Alexander Khrgian, who runs his law office in the coastal resort of Budva. He said that about 15,000 Russian-speaking people who permanently live in Montenegro feel safe. "I have been living in Russia for 25 years and now I am here for more than 10 years, and we love Montenegro. It is a wonderful country with wonderful climate," he said. "People know that Russia and Montenegro have very close cultural links. That is why we are here like at home." Montenegro says Moscow was behind a foiled coup attempt in October that allegedly targeted former Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, who was the driving force behind the country's NATO bid. Russia denies involvement. "One of the reasons we are joining NATO is to create greater stability, not only for Montenegrin citizens, but also for foreign investors and tourists," Djukanovic said. "Therefore, our goal is to bring even more Russian tourists." As a Serbian ally, Montenegro was bombed in 1999 by NATO, which launched airstrikes to stop a crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists. After deciding to split with Serbia in 2006 in a referendum, Montenegro took a strong turn toward Euro-Atlantic integration. On the eve of the NATO accession, Montenegrins don't seem interested in their country's historic move and many of them want good relations with both Russia and the West. "If we were neutral all the time, why shouldn't we continue with it so that we keep good relations with America, Russia and all the other countries?" said Mirko Bozovic from Podgorica. The pro-Russian opposition Democratic Front, whose top two leaders were indicted over allegedly planning the Russia-orchestrated coup, said the day when Montenegro joins NATO is one of the saddest days in its history. "Today, Montenegro is being annexed like never before in its history," official Strahinja Bulajic said. "Today is one of the most shameful days in Montenegrin history."
Rise in NI women travelling for abortions  [SEP]  More than 900 women from Northern Ireland travelled to England for an abortion last year, according to UK Department of Health figures. The number was an increase of over 25% on the year before and the highest level since 2011. The law is much stricter in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the UK. It is only permitted if a woman's life is at risk, or there is a permanent or serious risk to her mental or physical health. Fatal foetal abnormalities, rape and incest are not circumstances in which abortions can be performed legally. The High Court in Belfast ruled in 2015 that this was incompatible with human rights law. On Thursday human rights campaigners lost a Supreme Court appeal over the legality of Northern Ireland's abortion law. The new 2017 figures showed that numbers of Northern Ireland residents having an abortion in England and Wales has generally declined since a peak of 1,855 in 1990. The 2017 total is a decrease of 35% since 2007. Overall, 64% of non-residents travelled from the Republic of Ireland and 19% from Northern Ireland In May, the Republic of Ireland voted decisively in a referendum to reform the country's strict abortion laws, which had effectively banned all terminations. Wednesday's figures from the Department of Health in England and Wales show that 4,809 abortions for non-residents were carried out in England and Wales, a similar level to 2016. In June 2017 the government announced women from Northern Ireland will be able to get free abortions in England. Figures show there has been an increase in the number of women from Northern Ireland having an abortion in England and Wales since the funding announcement. In 2017, 919 women from Northern Ireland travelled to England for a termination, up from 724 in 2016. Nine out of 10 abortions were carried out under 13 weeks. The highest abortion rate is amongst women aged 20-24. Some 98% of abortions were funded by the NHS, the same level since 2013, but an increase from 88% in 2007. The abortion referendum in the Republic of Ireland reignited a debate about Northern Ireland's law, with some calling for reform while others, including the biggest party, the DUP, remain opposed to changing the law.
Dominican Republic ends Taiwan ties  [SEP]  The Dominican Republic has established diplomatic relations with China and cut its ties with Taiwan. Taiwan has said that it is "deeply upset" by the Caribbean nation's decision, which deepens its diplomatic isolation. The governments in Beijing and Taipei insist that countries cannot recognise both of them. China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province. Taiwan is now left with only 19 diplomatic allies. The island's foreign ministry said the Dominican Republic had accepted "false promises of investment and aid by China". Taipei also "strongly condemns China's objectionable decision to use dollar diplomacy to convert Taiwan's diplomatic allies". The Dominican Republic said it believed the switch would be "extraordinarily positive for the future of our country" and that it recognised Taiwan as "an inalienable part of the Chinese territory". It said that even without formal diplomatic ties, China was already its second largest supplier of imported products. • What is the 'One China' policy? Presidential legal adviser Flavio Dario Espinal told a news conference that the government was grateful to Taiwan. "However, history and the socioeconomic reality force us now to change direction," he explained. The number of countries recognising the island as a state has dwindled in recent years as China's diplomatic influence has strengthened. The last countries before the Dominican Republic to switch allegiance had been Panama last year and the African island nation of Sao Tome and Principe in 2016. Only 19 countries have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, most of them small island states or in Central and South America - regions that in the past had limited economic ties with China. They are: • Latin America and the Caribbean: Belize, El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, St Kitts and Nevis, St Vincent & the Grenadines, Guatemala, Paraguay, Honduras and Saint Lucia • The Pacific: Kiribati, Nauru, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Palau China and Taiwan have been ruled separately since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Relations between the two have worsened since the island elected Tsai Ing-wen as president in 2016. Ms Tsai has not formally endorsed the "one China" policy - an agreement in 1992 where both sides agreed there was only one China, but had different interpretations of what that meant. Beijing fears she will push for Taiwan's formal independence, but Ms Tsai says she wants to maintain the status quo. Since her election, Beijing has intensified its efforts to isolate Taiwan and persuade its supporters to switch sides. Given China's rapid growth as an economic and political global power, it has been increasingly easy for Beijing to sway countries to its side.
