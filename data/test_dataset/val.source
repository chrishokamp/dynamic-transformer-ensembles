Key House Democrat Formally Asks For Trump's Tax Returns  [SEP]  Democrats have long called for President Trump to release his tax returns, and now a key congressman has put in a formal request with the IRS. Massachusetts Democrat Richard Neal, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, is requesting six years of Trump's personal tax returns and the returns for some of his businesses for the years 2013-2018. Neal argues that Congress, his committee in particular, needs to conduct oversight of the IRS, including its policy of auditing the tax returns of sitting presidents. "We have completed the necessary groundwork for a request of this magnitude and I am certain we are within our legitimate legislative, legal, and oversight rights," he said in a statement about the request. Neal said the action was about "policy, not politics." "My actions reflect an abiding reverence for our democracy and our institutions, and are in no way based on emotion of the moment or partisanship," he said. In his letter IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, Neal asked for the information by April 10. Trump has been unique compared to recent presidents in his refusal to release his personal tax returns. Trump said on Wednesday he was "not inclined" to adhere to the demand. Taxpayer information is legally supposed to remain confidential, but a 1924 provision gives Congress some access. It has rarely been invoked, University of Virginia law professor George Yin told NPR in October 2018. That provision allows the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation to request the tax information. Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee started pushing the idea of getting Trump's tax returns after the president took office, but Republican majorities in Congress in 2017 and 2018 would not take action on the issue. In February, with Democrats freshly in control of the House of Representatives, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., urged patience in going after Trump's tax returns. "It's not a question of just sending a letter," Pelosi said. "You have to do it in a very careful way." Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said on Wednesday that "the law is crystal clear" that the Treasury Department must adhere to Neal's request. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the Ways and Means Committee last month that if such a request were to be made, the administration "will follow the law and we will protect the president as we would protect any individual taxpayer under their rights."
Four Indian soldiers killed in Kashmir gunfight  [SEP]  One soldier and one civilian were also critically wounded in the shootout as troops launched a search operation in Pulwama district where the suicide bomber struck on Thursday. "Four soldiers were killed during the shootout and another one is injured," a senior police officer told AFP on condition of anonymity. The official said the soldiers fired warning shots and the militants fired back, unleashing the firefight in the district 40 kilometres (25 miles) south of the Indian-administered territory's main city of Srinagar. The official added that the rebels were believed to have escaped though a search operation was being stepped up.
NE Ohio 'perfect fit' for Amazon HQ, Ryan writes to Bezos  [SEP]  U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan wants Amazon to consider Northeast Ohio for its next headquarters after pulling out of New York. But not only doesn’t the company have any plans to look elsewhere, this area would be a longshot at best if it did. Amazon announced Thursday it was canceling its plans to build its second headquarters in New York City after some politicians and activists objected to the nearly $3 billion in incentives the state and city were offering the company. Ryan of Howland, D-13th, wrote a letter Friday to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos urging him to build the company’s headquarters in Northeast Ohio. Ryan said Friday: “Northeast Ohio is a perfect fit for Amazon to build its second headquarters.” He touted the areas transportation infrastructure, “business-friendly environment” and universities. “We have people here ready to work, and the dedication and commitment they show every day is second to none,” Ryan said. “I will work with Jeff Bezos and leaders in our community to make this a reality. And I hope Amazon can consider Northeast Ohio as their newest home.” Amazon said Thursday it had no current plans to find a replacement location.

Interviews Juan Guaidó  [SEP]  Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who last month was recognized by the U.S. as the acting president of Venezuela, talked to VOA's Spanish service on Feb. 1. Guaidó told VOA Noticias he is reaching out to military leaders in Venezuela, Russia and China for support.
Communities on high alert as Cyclone Fani makes landfall - India  [SEP]  Cyclone Fani, one of the strongest storms to hit the Indian subcontinent in decades, made landfall near Puri, India, at 8am on Friday 3 May, with winds gusting at more than 190kmh. Tens of millions of people are in the cyclone’s path, and more than a million people were evacuated away from the coast in India alone. Stretches of coastal India and Bangladesh are threatened by storm surges, and heavy rains could cause flooding. The local authorities have set up around 850 shelters and have evacuated 1 million people living along the coast. The Indian Red Cross is operating 65 shelters in Odisha state, with a capacity of 1,000 to 3,000 people in each. They can withstand winds of 400kmh and storm surges of 1.5m. For India, IFRC has allocated 87,700 Swiss francs from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund for preparedness, initial assessment and, if necessary, emergency assistance. A total of 59 million people in Bangladesh (total population 165 million) could be exposed to cyclone wind or a deep depression. Communities have been advised to listen for evacuation orders related to Fani, which has since been downgraded from a “severe extreme cyclonic storm” to a “very severe storm”.
‘Frankenstein’ scientists instil life into pig brains four hours after death  [SEP]  A bizarre Frankenstein-style experiment has breathed life into the brains of pigs four hours after death. Scientists in the US restored circulation and cellular activity in 32 pig brains obtained from a meat-packing plant. While there was no evidence of re-awakening awareness or consciousness, the re-vitalised brains were said to be “cellularly active”. The study has huge implications that challenge long-held assumptions about the finality of death, and opens up a new frontier in brain research. The experiment has overtones of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (Pixabay/PA) Lead scientist Professor Nenad Sestan, from Yale University, said: “The intact brain of a large mammal retains a previously under-appreciated capacity for restoration of circulation and certain molecular and cellular activities multiple hours after circulatory arrest.” Cellular brain death is usually considered to be swift and irreversible. Once the supply of oxygen and blood are cut off, the brain’s electrical activity and signs of awareness vanish within seconds. A cascade of destruction then occurs leading to widespread degeneration from which there is no turning back. Clinically defined, this is not a living brain, but it is a cellularly active brain However Professor Sestan and his team noticed that small brain tissue samples routinely showed signs of cellular life returning, even when harvested hours after death. To investigate further, they turned their attention to whole, intact brains from pigs processed for food production. In a ground-breaking experiment, a specially designed “chemical blood” preservative was circulated through the brains of dead animals that had been slaughtered four hours earlier. The solution, warmed to normal body temperature, was perfused through the brains’ blood vessels for six hours. During this time the scientists observed a reduction in cell death and the restored functionality of certain nerve, blood vessel and glial cells. Glial cells are important brain “support cells” that hold neurons in place, feed them with nutrients and oxygen, provide insulation, and clean up the carcasses of dead cells. The revived activity even included some synaptic function, the transmission of signals between neurons. Details of the study are published in the latest issue of Nature journal. Co-author Dr Zvonimir Vrselja, also from Yale, said: “At no point did we observe the kind of organised electrical activity associated with perception, awareness, or consciousness. “Clinically defined, this is not a living brain, but it is a cellularly active brain.” Lessons learned from the study could in future help doctors find ways to salvage brain function in stroke patients, or test the effectiveness of treatments designed to aid cellular recovery after injury, say the scientists. The “BrainEx” system developed at Yale could also provide a powerful research tool. Andrea Beckel-Mitchener, from the US National Institute of of Mental Health, which co-funded the research, said: “This line of research holds hope for advancing understanding and treatment of brain disorders and could lead to a whole new way of studying the post-mortem human brain.” Any future studies involving human tissue or the possible revival of global electrical activity in “dead” animal brains would have to undergo strict ethical supervision, the team stressed. However it was unclear that the technique would work in a recently deceased human brain. The chemical solution lacked many components found naturally in human blood, such as immune system cells. Dr Stephen Latham, director of Yale University’s Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics, said: “Restoration of consciousness was never a goal of this research. “The researchers were prepared to intervene with the use of anaesthetics and temperature-reduction to stop organised global electrical activity if it were to emerge. “Everyone agreed in advance that experiments involving revived global activity couldn’t go forward without clear ethical standards and institutional oversight mechanisms.” In Mary Shelley’s famous gothic novel, Dr Victor Frankenstein instils life into a monster created from dead body parts obtained from grave yards and butchers. British expert Professor Derek Hill, from University College London, said: “This research raises some fascinating questions. Firstly, was this somehow a chance finding, or can it be reliably replicated? “Secondly, could brains maintained by BrainEx help scientists discover new treatments for brain diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, which are proving really hard to treat? “And thirdly, what are the ethical implications for the way we treat animals after slaughter, and humans after accidents? “This ingenious experimental work provides challenges and opportunities both to brain scientists and for science policy makers.”
Huge vegan protest blocks Melbourne CBD  [SEP]  Melbourne's busiest interection has been completely blocked off by vegans conducting a "peaceful" peak-hour protest. Hundreds of vegans from all over Victoria gathered at 5.30am outside Flinders Street Station holding signs and blocking cars and trams from passing through. Police officers are at the scene filming the protests but not intervening. It's part of a wave of action that includes activists blocking the entrance to the MC Herd abattoir in Geelong and chaining themselves to a truck in Pakenham, southeast of Melbourne. Protests are also being planned for Sydney, Brisbane and Hobart, but the exact locations are closely guarded. Last night, vegans gathered at Queen Victoria Market calling for an end to slaughterhouses and further action is expected throughout the day. Prime Minister Scott Morrison admonished the animal activists as "un-Australian" on 2GB radio this morning, but vegans on the ground say they're "hard to argue with". Doctor of Paediatric Neuropsychology Helen Jeges held a sign above her head at this morning's protest on Flinders Street. It read: "I am a doctor. Vegan: 5 years". "We want to open people's eyes to what they're really paying for," Dr Jeges told news.com.au. "A lot of people don't know that if you buy eggs, male chicks are ground up alive. It's to raise awareness." She said the protests had not been met by hostility, but commuters were frustrated this morning when trying to catch trams through the CBD. "The response has been really great," Dr Jeges said. "We don't expect any antagonism. We represent kindness, equality, non-violence, and so it's hard to argue against that." The activists are trying to bring attention to the documentary Dominion on the one-year anniversary of the film's release. It shows footage inside Australia's abattoirs. Already this morning, police have broken up a protest at a Queensland abattoir. About 20 animal rights campaigners descended on the Warwick abattoir and chained themselves to equipment before police were called to remove them. Farmers across NSW and Queensland have also been placed on high alert as a number of groups plan to carry out a series of co-ordinated raids - which they say is "the biggest animal rights direct action the world has ever seen". Up to 200 others remained outside the facility, protesting against what they said was the barbaric slaughter of sheep and pigs. There's no word of any arrests, and the protest was over by about 5.30am, about two hours after police were called to a break-in at the property. Brad King, from the activist group Farm Animal Rescue, was among those at the protest and said animals slaughtered at the site had endured terrifying deaths. "There are numerous occasions where they're not stunned properly, but even when they are, the footage unequivocally demonstrates that it's impossible to 'humanely' kill an animal who desperately doesn't want to die," he said in a statement. It comes as Queensland is beefing up powers to stop animal rights protesters invading farms for illegal and potentially dangerous protests that are stressing farmers already struggling after floods and drought. New laws are being drafted to allow police and agricultural officers to fine vegan activists whose activities risk the lives of farmers, workers and animals, says Mark Furner, Minister for Agricultural Industry Development and Fisheries. "Everyone has the right to protest, but nobody has the right to break the law," Mr Furner said in a statement on Sunday. Queensland farmers deserved respect and needed to be protected, he said. "Many of our farmers are already under great stress following years of drought and more recently the floods, and we are standing side-by-side with them," Mr Furner said. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries will form a joint taskforce with the state police intelligence unit to focus on animal activism. Premier Anastasia Palaszczuk said the activists were coming mainly from interstate to cause Queensland farmers distress, and their activities were also impacting the export industry. Mr Furner said the taskforce and fines were being designed to act as a strong deterrent to unlawful behaviour. The move comes after Federal Agriculture Minister David Littleproud has been calling for higher fines from states. He has also been calling, so far unsuccessfully, for one animal rights group to pull down a controversial map of farm locations the minister calls an "attack map". The Aussie Farms Map says it is a comprehensive, interactive map of factory farms, slaughterhouses and other animal exploitation facilities across Australia. It lists the exact co-ordinates of people's home businesses and other details, such as ABN numbers, that can be used to find more personal details about the owners.
UPDATE 1-Italy's Eni says monitoring Venezuela situation very...  [SEP]  MILAN, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Italian oil and gas group Eni is monitoring the situation in Venezuela very carefully but its production in the country for now is unaffected, a spokesman said on Thursday. “The situation in the fields is quiet and under control,” the spokesman said. On Wednesday Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself interim president, winning the backing of Washington and many Latin American nations. His move prompted socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who has led the oil-rich nation since 2013, to break relations with the United States. OPEC oil producer Venezuela produced more than 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017, but a deep economic and social crisis has seen output plummet as millions of people flee the country. Foreign oil companies operating in the area have had problems with payments in oil from Venezuela. State-controlled Eni, which has been in Venezuela since 1998, currently produces around 46,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. It has a 50 percent stake in the giant Perla gas field, a 40 percent stake in the Junin 5 oilfield and owns 26 percent of the Corocoro oilfield. (Reporting by Stephen Jewkes; editing by Jason Neely)
U.S.-Taliban talks for Afghan peace gain steam, but Taliban still preparing for war  [SEP]  Kabul, Afghanistan -- The Afghan Taliban and the United States have resumed high-level talks in Doha, Qatar, aimed at ending America's longest involvement in any war. The U.S. envoy to the Afghanistan peace talks, Zalmay Khalilzad, has met the Taliban's political leader and co-founder of the Islamic insurgency, whose mere presence in this round of talks could indicate headway. But even as the talks enter a new, more serious phase, the Taliban is preparing its forces to wage war. Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar is a respected figure among the Taliban. He is thought to bring decision making authority to the negotiating table. He arrived in Doha "after a formal invitation by the Foreign Minister of Qatar and in a private airplane sent by" Qatar, "where he was warmly received," according to a statement released by the Taliban. The objective of this round of talks is to hammer out some of the details of a broad "roadmap" for peace that was discussed in previous meetings. At the heart of the negotiations is when, and under what circumstances the U.S. will pull its troops out of Afghanistan. The conversation has taken place thus far with the notable absence of any Afghan government representatives. The Taliban refuses to meet Afghan government officials, as it considers the administration a puppet regime of the United States. Nazar Muhammad Mutamaeen, a political analyst and former official under the Taliban regime toppled by the U.S. invasion in 2001, told CBS News that "the difference in this round of talks" is Baradar's presence. The elder militant was once the deputy of Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban's supreme leader who died in 2013. He was freed by Pakistan -- in an effort to boost the peace talks -- after more than a decade in prison following his 2010 arrest by U.S. and Pakistani forces. Mutamaeen said that with Baradar at the table, "the current Taliban representatives taking part in the negotiations are powerful and authoritative… capable of making decisions without wasting time going back to their leaders." Khalilzad said on Tuesday, after meeting Baradar, that the talks represented a "significant moment." The biggest point still under negotiation is the timetable for the withdrawal of the roughly 12,000 U.S. forces in Afghanistan -- and in return, when the Taliban will agree to guarantee that Afghan territory will not be used as a terrorist safe haven to plot attacks on the United States or its allies. When in the process the Taliban will accept a ceasefire and stop attacking Afghan forces -- and engage in direct talks with the Afghan government -- are also key topics on the agenda. The talks in Qatar were scheduled to go through Wednesday, but they could be extended if needed. "Once an agreement is made in the external aspect of talks, which is the pull-out of foreign forces, then we can speak about the internal aspect of peace talks with the Afghan government," said Sohail Shaheen, a spokesman for the Taliban's political office in Doha. While the U.S.-Taliban discussions may be gaining steam, Shaheen said there was currently no plan to cancel the group's annual spring offensive against Afghan and allied forces. "Only if an agreement is reached, and an Islamic government is formed to include all Afghans, will we neither need a spring offensive nor be required to fight," Shaheen said. The Afghan government, sidelined from the ongoing talks to end the 18-year war, is planning to hold a grand council of tribal elders next month that would include between 2,000 and 3,000 representatives from across the country. The objective would be for the government to get feedback to start laying down the parameters of any eventual talks with the Taliban. President Ashraf Ghani, who is seeking a second term in elections to be held in July, said in his nomination speech that he would, "work for peace on behalf of a dignified and a painful nation, but we will not beg for peace from anyone." The United Nations released a report this week which shows the extent to which regular Afghans have borne the brunt of the suffering through this war. Among other grim statistics, the report found "the highest recorded number of boys and girls killed in the conflict during a single year" in 2018. In total, the UN's Afghan mission said 3,804 civilians were killed last year alone, and another 7,189 injured left injured, "representing a five percent increase in overall civilian casualties and an 11 percent increase in civilian deaths compared to 2017." The U.N. blamed 63 percent of those casualties on "Anti-Government Elements (AGEs)," with the Taliban's owning a 37 percent share of the violence.
Consumers Energy is asking customers to voluntarily reduce gas usage  [SEP]  Consumers Energy has asked all customers to voluntarily reduce their natural gas usage as a result of an unexpected fire in southeast Michigan. “As a result of an unexpected incident at a gas compressor station this morning in southeast Michigan, we are asking customers to temporarily reduce gas usage at this time while we continue to contain the incident and help keep Michigan residents warm during this cold spell,” said Garrick Rochow, senior vice president of Operations for Consumers Energy. A fire involving equipment at Consumers Energy’s Ray Natural Gas Compressor Station occurred in Macomb County at 10:33 a.m. on Jan. 30. All gas flow from the compressor station has been shut off until safety and damage assessments can be completed. Consumers Energy is activating natural gas peaking storage fields in Northville and St. Clair to help deliver natural gas to their customers. Natural gas is stored underground and reserved in these fields, which are activated when energy demand requires it. In addition, the company has reached out to its largest business customers to reduce gas usage while they continue to investigate the incident. The fire is being contained and there were no injuries. The cause of the fire is under investigation. Residents and businesses can reduce gas usage by doing the following: • LOOK AT THERMOSTAT SETTINGS: Save energy while staying warm by setting your heat to a lower temperature. Use your programmable thermostat to set your heat at 65 degrees when you are home and 62 degrees when you are away for less than 5 hours. • BUSINESS REDUCTION OF PROCESSES: The company is also encouraging industrial and business customers to temporarily reduce processes. • SEAL & SHUT WINDOWS AND DOORS: Check for leaks in your windows and doors by feeling around for cool air. Also, please ensure all windows and doors are closed tightly. For more information or tips, visit: www.consumersenergy.com/coldweather
Report: Hundreds abused by Southern Baptist leaders, workers  [SEP]  SAN ANTONIO (AP) — Hundreds of Southern Baptist church leaders and workers have been accused of sexual misconduct over the past 20 years, including dozens who returned to church duties, according to a joint investigation by two newspapers. The San Antonio Express-News and Houston Chronicle reported Sunday that their six-month investigation found about 380 Southern Baptist church leaders and workers who were accused of sexual misconduct since 1998, leaving more than 700 victims. Some were as young as 3 years old while others were adults when they were abused, the newspapers reported. About 220 offenders — among them pastors, ministers, Sunday school teachers, deacons and church volunteers — have been convicted or have taken plea deals, with dozens of cases still pending. Nearly 100 are still in prison, according to state and federal records. Dozens of others made plea deals and served no time. More than 100 are registered sex offenders, and some have returned to the pulpit. At least 35 church pastors, employees and volunteers who exhibited predatory behavior were still able to find jobs at churches. Several past presidents and prominent Southern Baptist Convention leaders have been accused by victims of concealing or mishandling abuse complaints within their churches or seminaries, the newspapers reported. In 2008, a victim implored SBC leaders to track sexual predators, act against congregations that harbored or concealed abusers and establish sexual abuse prevention policies such as those adopted by other faiths, including the Roman Catholic Church. But the SBC Executive Committee rejected the proposals. The committee's interim president, August Boto, who drafted that rejection document, expressed "sorrow" on Sunday about the newspapers' findings. "It would be sorrow if it were 200 or 600 cases. Sorrow. What we're talking about is criminal. The fact that criminal activity occurs in a church context is always the basis of grief. But it's going to happen. And that statement (he drafted in 2008) does not mean that we must be resigned to it," he told the newspapers. The Rev. J.D. Greear, who was elected as the SBC's president last June, said the abuses described in the news report "are pure evil." "I am broken over what was revealed today," Greear wrote in a series of posts on Twitter. "The voices in this article should be heard as a warning sent from God, calling the church to repent." In recent years, several abuse survivors and their supporters have campaigned on the issue of sexual abuse within the SBC community. Activists remain skeptical as to whether the study committee created last July will recommend sufficiently tough anti-abuse measures. The committee was formed following a series of revelations about sexual misconduct cases involving SBC churches and seminaries, including allegations that led to the ouster of powerful leader Paige Patterson as president of a seminary in Texas. "We leaders in the SBC should have listened to the warnings of those who tried to call attention to this," Greear tweeted. "I am committed to doing everything possible to ensure we never make these mistakes again." He said the SBC must do better in preventing abuse, commit to full cooperation with legal authorities when it does occur, and offer better care to abuse victims. He also the SBC should never again try to skirt responsibility for abuse by asserting that its affiliated churches are autonomous. In late July, the SBC said it would form a high-level study group to develop strategies for combatting sexual abusers and ministering to their victims. "We cannot just promise to 'do better' and expect that to be enough," Greear wrote. "But today, change begins with feeling the full weight of the problem."
Propaganda Alert: Hezbollah in Venezuela! Maduro "steals" 8 tons of gold! --  [SEP]  The claim that Hezbollah has ties to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was reinforced by a report by the Jerusalem Post, citing former Venezuelan Intelligence Chief Hugo Carvajal. The article was originally published on February 24, but US National Security Adviser shared it on twitter on February 27, with accusations that no longer mention "Maduro and his cronies," but rather Maduro and "a counsel of terrorists and Cuban minders."According to the Jerusalem Post article, which itself cites a NYT report , Carvajal revealed powerful ties between the administration of President Nicolás Maduro and the Hezbollah terrorist group, as well as wide-spread corruption and drug activity.Allegedly, those who were meant to combat drugs were engaged in trafficking them, Carvajal said.El Aissami was not only a drug kingpin, said Carvajal, but also had connections to Hezbollah, and attempted to arrange Hezbollah terrorists to work with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [FARC] through Venezuela.The claim that Hezbollah has ties with the Maduro government was initially suggested by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo close around 14 days earlier.On February 24th, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif expressed his country's support of Maduro's government and slammed any foreign intervention in Venezuela's internal affairs. Thus, it is also possible that accusations of Iranian influence to being circulating the media soon.Meanwhile, Reuters reported, citing opposition Legislator Angel Alvarado and three anonymous government sources who claimed that Nicolas Maduro had removed at least 8 tons of gold from the Venezuelan central bank's vaults between February 20and 22This was done while there were no regular security guards present at the bank. According to Alvarado they plan to sell it illegally abroad.The anonymous sources and Alvarado did not say where the gold would be sold. They said the operation took place while central bank head Calixto Ortega was abroad on a trip.Separately, on February 27the containers were also placed on the Simon Bolivar bridge to block it as well. It is a major pedestrian crossing between Colombia and Venezuela. It is also the place where the "humanitarian aid truck" was set on fire allegedly by the Venezuelan military.The Tienditas bridge, which is blocked for passage all year round was also blocked by shipping containers in January.US-Proclaimed Interim President Juan Guaido who travelled to Colombia, despite a travel ban imposed by the Venezuelan Supreme Court also travelled to Brazil on the evening of February 27to meet with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro as part of a tour of several nations to ratchet up international pressure on President Nicolas Maduro to step down.Maduro said that Guaido should face justice after he returns to Venezuela because he went against the supreme court's ruling.Meanwhile, in his address to the UN Human Rights Council Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza suggested that Maduro and Trump should meet and "try to find common ground and explain their differences."US Vice President Mike Pence discarded the suggestion, saying that the only thing to discuss is the exact "time and date of his [Maduro's] departure."On Thursday, both the US and Russia submitted their own draft resolutions on the Venezuelan crisis.The decision to submit the Russian draft resolution was announced by Russian mission to the UN Fyodor Strzhizhovsky.An anonymous diplomatic source told TASS that the vote on Russia's draft resolution on Venezuela at the UN Security Council is planned for Thursday.Maduro's vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, is also to travel to Moscow for talks with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on March 1. Russia has continued to support Maduro government throughout the crisis and despite continuing false media reports that it is doubting the "regime."
Mexico's 'El Chapo' found guilty in U.S. drug trial  [SEP]  NEW YORK (Reuters) - The world's most infamous cartel boss Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, who rose from poverty in rural Mexico to run a global drug empire and amass billions of dollars, was found guilty in a U.S. court on Tuesday of operating a criminal enterprise. Jurors in federal court in Brooklyn began delivering their verdict following an 11-week trial. Guzman, 61, now faces a possible sentence of life in prison. Guzman, one of the major figures in Mexican drug wars that have roiled the country since 2006, was extradited to the United States for trial in 2017 after he was arrested in Mexico the year before. Though other high-ranking cartel figures had been extradited previously, Guzman was the first to go to trial instead of pleading guilty. The trial, which featured testimony from more than 50 witnesses, offered the public an unprecedented look at the inner workings of the Sinaloa Cartel, named for the state in northwestern Mexico where Guzman was born in a poor mountain village. The legend of Guzman was burnished by two dramatic escapes he made from Mexican prisons and by a "Robin Hood" image he cultivated among Sinaloa's poor. U.S. prosecutors said he trafficked tons of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine into the United States over more than two decades, consolidating his power in Mexico through murders and wars with rival cartels.
‘Afraid of Death’: Videos of Indian army go viral on social media  [SEP]  ‘Afraid of Death’: Videos of Indian army go viral on social media KARACHI: Against the backdrop of the latest escalation between Pakistan and Indian, a number of videos showing Indian army personnel fearing death have gone viral on social media platforms. In a video clip, an Indian army man can be seen slamming his own country’s army. He laments that an Indian Premier League (IPL) player is given more than Rs30 million without even playing a match, but when a Sepoy dies, it takes investigators over three years to probe the actual cause of his death. Similarly, a woman, identified as a mother of an Indian soldier can be seen in a TV show, saying she would never want to send more of her sons to serve in Indian army. Yesterday, Pakistani officials night handed over Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot Abhinandan Varthaman to Indian counterparts at Wahga Border crossing. Amid tight security, the Indian pilot was transported to Wahga Border after his traveling documents were finalised by Pakistani officials. The release of pilot Abhinandan is a gesture of peace from Pakistan, in order to de-escalate the soaring tensions with New Delhi. The announcement to release the captured pilot was made on Thursday by Prime Minister Imran Khan during a joint session of parliament. On February 27, Pakistan Air Force (PAF) after striking down two Indian fighter jets arrested one pilot, who ejected himself after being hit in the airspace of Pakistan in Azad Jammu and Kashmir — something that came as an unexpected setback for India.
The Latest: Kenyan officials say no people missing in attack  [SEP]  NAIROBI, Kenya — The Latest on the extremist attack on a Nairobi hotel and shopping complex. (all times local): Kenyan authorities say there are no longer any cases of missing people following an extremist attack on a hotel complex in Nairobi. The Kenya Red Cross said Thursday that all 94 cases of people reported to be missing had been “closed positively.” Police say 21 people, plus five attackers, died in the attack on the DusitD2 complex in the Kenyan capital. Kenya’s information minister says the government’s quick reaction to a deadly extremist attack in Nairobi this week reflects improvements in its ability to respond to such brazen assaults on civilian targets. Joseph Mucheru said Thursday that the reaction of authorities when gunmen attacked the DusitD2 hotel, office and shopping complex on Tuesday was “much better handled, communicated” in comparison to the 2013 attack on the nearby Westgate Mall. “The speed, the response and the conclusion of this matter was swift,” Mucheru said. Kenyan police said 21 people, plus five extremists, died in the latest attack. Kenya’s president declared that the security operation to retake the complex was over around 20 hours after it started. The al-Shabab group claimed responsibility, showing it can still strike despite heavy military pressure in Somalia. Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Sudan army topples veteran leader Bashir, protestors vow more demos | Malay Mail  [SEP]  KHARTOUM, April 11 — Sudan’s army ousted veteran president Omar al-Bashir today, but protestors against his iron-fisted rule swiftly rejected a “coup” by the military and vowed to keep up their demonstrations. In a sombre televised address, Defence Minister Awad Ibnouf announced “the toppling of the regime” and said Bashir had been detained in “a secure place”, bringing an end to his three-decade rule. A transitional military council will replace the president for two years, he said, adding that the country’s borders and airspace would be shut until further notice. But in a warning to protestors, he also imposed a night-time curfew from 10pm (2000 GMT) to 4am (0200 GMT). Bashir, who swept to power in a 1989 coup, was one of Africa’s longest-serving presidents. He is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of genocide and war crimes. But organisers of the protests, which first erupted in December, rejected the army’s move and vowed to keep up their campaign until the whole regime was swept aside. “The people do not want a transitional military council,” said Alaa Salah, who became an icon of the protest movement after a video of her leading demonstrators’ chants outside army headquarters went viral. “Change will not happen with Bashir’s entire regime hoodwinking Sudanese civilians through a military coup,” she tweeted. “We want a civilian council to head the transition.” The protestors’ Alliance for Freedom and Change said the regime had “conducted a military coup by bringing back the same faces and the same institutions which our people rose against.” It urged people “to continue their sit-in in front of army headquarters and across all regions and in the streets.” Since early this morning, huge crowds of jubilant Sudanese had filled squares across the centre of Khartoum as the army promised an “important announcement”. Chanting “the regime has fallen,” they poured into the open ground outside army headquarters, where defiant protesters had braved tear gas and gunfire to keep up an unprecedented sit-in, now in its sixth day. But the festive mood later soured, as protestors chanted: “We don’t want Ibnouf!” “We are not leaving, we are not leaving. Just fall and that’s all,” they shouted. The opposition Sudanese Congress Party called on the military council to dissolve itself and form “a joint military and civilian council to run the government for a four-year transition term”. It also urged the army to give executive powers to civilians. Adel, a protestor outside army headquarters, said today’s announcement meant “we have not achieved anything.” “We will not stop our revolution. We are calling for the regime to step down, not only Bashir,” he said. Army vehicles carrying troops were seen deploying across the centre of Khartoum from early today. Troops raided the offices of the Islamic Movement, the ideological wing of Bashir’s ruling National Congress Party, witnesses told AFP. Martial music was played on state television as soldiers ordered the TV to halt its normal programming ahead of Ibnouf’s announcement. Outside army headquarters, dozens of joyful protesters early today climbed on top of landcruisers and armoured vehicles that had been posted to protect them from intervention by other branches of the security forces. Braving the searing 42 degree Celsius heat, they hugged and kissed soldiers in the crowd. The military council said it was declaring a ceasefire across the country, including in war-torn Darfur. Meanwhile, Sudan’s feared intelligence service said it was freeing all the country’s political prisoners, state media reported. “The National Intelligence and Security Service has announced it is releasing all political detainees across the country,” the official Suna news agency said. But in the eastern cities of Kasala and Port Sudan, the releases failed to materialise, prompting protesters to storm NISS buildings, witnesses said. That came despite protest organisers urging demonstrators to refrain from attacking government figures or buildings. Demonstrators have spent five nights defiantly camped outside the sprawling army headquarters complex in Khartoum, which also houses Bashir’s official residence and the defence ministry. “We had enough of this regime — 30 years of repression, corruption, rights abuses, it’s enough,” said one protester at the sit-in. The demonstrators have braved repeated volleys of tear gas from NISS members since they began camping outside the complex on Saturday, protest organisers say. Officials say 49 people have died in protest-related violence since the demonstrations first erupted in December. Neighbouring Egypt, where President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi came to power in similar circumstances, said today it supported the Sudanese people and the army in their political transition. — AFP
US battle commander: Isil ‘caliphate’ on brink of defeat in Syria  [SEP]  NEAR BAGHOUZ - US-backed fighters in Syria are poised to capture Islamic State’s (Isil) last, a tiny enclave on the Euphrates, the battle commander said on Saturday, bringing its self-declared caliphate to the brink of total defeat as US President Donald Trump spoke of “100% victory”. Jiya Furat said the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) had cornered the remaining militants in a neighbourhood of Baghouz village near the Iraqi border, under fire from all sides. “In the coming few days, in a very short time, we will spread the good tidings to the world of the military end of Daesh,” he said, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State. He was speaking after Trump said on Friday there would be “great announcements” about Syria over the next 24 hours. Trump on Saturday said the caliphate was “ready to fall and that the United States was asking European allies to take back more than 800 Islamic State fighters captured in Syria and put them on trial. “The United States is asking Britain, France, Germany and other European allies to take back over 800 Isil fighters that we captured in Syria and put them on trial,” he said in a Tweet. “The Caliphate is ready to fall. The alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them... “.... The US does not want to watch as these Isil fighters permeate Europe, which is where they are expected to go. We do so much and spend so much - Time for others to step up and do the job that they are so capable of doing. We are pulling back after 100% Caliphate victory!” Trump has sworn to pull US forces from Syria after Islamic State’s territorial defeat, raising questions over the fate of Washington’s Kurdish allies and Turkish involvement in northeast Syria. As the SDF advanced under heavy US airstrikes in recent days, a stream of civilians fled the few square miles of hamlets and farmland that remain within Islamic State’s ‘caliphate’, along with defeated jihadists trying to escape unnoticed. Though Islamic State fighters still hold out in a pocket of central Syria’s remote desert and have gone underground as sleeper cells in Iraqi cities, able to launch new attacks, their territorial rule is, for now, almost over. It ends a project launched from the great mediaeval mosque of Mosul in northern Iraq in 2014, when Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi seized advantage of regional chaos to proclaim himself caliph, suzerain overall Muslim people and land. He set up a governing system with courts, currency and flag that at its height stretched from northwest Syria almost to Baghdad, encompassing some two million inhabitants. But its reign of terror over minorities and other perceived enemies, marked by massacres, sexual slavery and the beheading of hostages, drew a forceful international military response that pushed it steadily back from 2015. Most of the fighters left in Baghouz are foreigners, the SDF has said, among the thousands drawn by Baghdadi’s promise of a new jihadist utopia straddling the Iraqi-Syrian border and expunging national borders. All that remains, said Furat, is an encircled pocket some 700 metres square. “Thousands of civilians are still trapped there as human shields,” he said. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the SDF had taken control of all of Baghouz after the jihadists there surrendered. SDF officials denied this. Spokesman Mustafa Bali said the SDF had caught several militants trying to flee among the civilians. Others had handed themselves over. Their fate, and that of their families, has befuddled foreign governments, with few ready to repatriate citizens who pledged allegiance to a group sworn to their destruction, but who might be hard to legally prosecute. The SDF does not want to hold them indefinitely. The fate of Baghdadi is also a mystery. He has led the group since 2010, when it was still an underground al-Qaeda offshoot in Iraq. Its capacity then for strategic retreats in hard times, followed by rebounds when circumstances changed, has prompted numerous warnings that Islamic State’s defeat has not ended the threat it poses to the region. Islamic State suffered crippling defeats in 2017, when Iraq recaptured Mosul, the SDF seized its Syrian capital of Raqqa, and the Damascus government pushed it east to the Euphrates. But in Iraq it has switched to guerrilla hit-and-run tactics, aimed at undermining the Baghdad government. It has also claimed responsibility for a series of bombings in swathes of northeast Syria held by the SDF, including one last month that killed four Americans. That attack came soon after Trump pledged to pull out, saying Islamic State was already defeated, rattling allies and prompting defence secretary Jim Mattis to resign. Turkey, which regards the SDF’s strongest component, the Kurdish YPG, as terrorists, has threatened to march deeper into northern Syria to drive it back. On Friday US Army General Joseph Votel, who oversees US forces in the Middle East as head of Central Command, said the end of the territorial caliphate would lead to a more dispersed, harder-to-detect network of fighters waging guerrilla warfare. That should require continued help from Washington, he said.
Columbine threat by woman with gun shuts Denver-area schools  [SEP]  LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) — Denver-area public schools will be closed Wednesday as authorities search for a young Florida woman who flew to the city and bought a gun after becoming "infatuated" with the mass shooting at Columbine High School. The FBI said Sol Pais, 18, is "considered to be extremely dangerous" and "made threats to commit an act of violence in the Denver metropolitan area" just days before the 20th anniversary of the attack that killed 13 people. All schools in the Denver area were urged to tighten security because the threat was deemed "credible and general," said Patricia Billinger, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Public Safety. Columbine and more than 20 other schools outside Denver lock their doors for nearly three hours Tuesday afternoon before Wednesday's complete closures were announced. The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office and the FBI say Pais traveled to Colorado from Miami on Monday night and bought a pump-action shotgun and ammunition. Denver Public Schools said that all facilities and programs will be closed Wednesday, and there will be no afternoon activities or athletic competitions. The district said the decision to close campuses was in collaboration with other Denver metro-area school districts due to the ongoing safety concern. On Tuesday, some schools released their students after additional security was called in and canceled evening activities or moved them inside. "We always have heightened awareness close to high-profile anniversaries like this," Billinger said. Authorities said Pais was last seen near Columbine -- in the Jefferson County foothills outside Denver -- wearing a black T-shirt, camouflage pants and black boots. They appealed for anyone seeing her to call an FBI tip line at 303 630-6227, and said she is too dangerous to be approached by civilians. The alert also said police who come into contact with her should detain her and evaluate her mental health. "This has become a massive manhunt ... and every law enforcement agency is participating and helping in this effort," Dean Phillips, special agent in charge of the FBI in Denver, said late Tuesday night. The FBI's Rocky Mountain Safe Streets Task Force issued a notice Tuesday describing Pais as "infatuated with (the) Columbine school shooting." Sheriff's spokesman Mike Taplin said the threats she made were general and not specific to any school. The Denver Post reported that a call to a phone number listed for Pais' parents in Surfside, Florida, was interrupted by a man who identified himself as an FBI agent and said he was interviewing them. Surfside Police Sgt. Marian Cruz confirmed that her parents last saw her on Sunday and reported her missing on Monday. The Miami Herald and WTVJ are reporting that neighbors say the teen is a senior at Miami Beach High School. The Associated Press left messages at two numbers listed for Pais' relatives in Florida, while another number was disconnected. Two teenage gunmen attacked Columbine on April 20, 1999, killing 12 classmates and a teacher. Associated Press writer Thomas Peipert in Denver contributed to this report.
Algerian protesters keep up pressure on Bouteflika to quit  [SEP]  ALGIERS, March 26 (Reuters) - Thousands of people rallied in Algiers on Tuesday calling on President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to quit, keeping up the pressure in weeks of protests that threaten to topple him and the elderly elite that has helped keep him in power for 20 years. Bouteflika, among the veterans of the 1954-62 war of independence against France who continue to dominate Algeria, has bowed to protesters by reversing a decision to seek another term and putting off elections that had been set for April. But Bouteflika stopped short earlier this month of quitting as head of state and said he would stay on until a new constitution is adopted, effectively extending his current term. The move failed to placate hundreds of thousands of Algerians who have taken to the streets for nearly five weeks to demand that Bouteflika step down. "The system must go. There is no point for it in resisting," said Belkacem Abidi, 25, one of about 6,000 protesters, mostly students, who gathered in downtown Algiers on Tuesday. Even if Bouteflika is pushed out, Algerians could face uncertainty for some time before a new president emerges to head the vast North African country, a major oil and gas producer. One of the most important factors is the position of the powerful military, which could act as kingmaker, as it has done in past decades. So far, the chief of staff has distanced the army from Bouteflika and praised the protesters. Any direct action to help Algerians oust him could be perceived as a military coup by an institution which prefers to manipulate politics from behind the scenes. Some important partners such as members of his ruling party and business tycoons have abandoned Bouteflika, deepening the isolation of an 82-year-old leader who has rarely been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 2013. "I´m optimistic that our pressure will change things peacefully," said architect Noureddine Bahi, 52.
PM Modi condoles loss of lives in Delhi hotel fire  [SEP]  NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has condoled the loss of lives in a massive fire incident in a central Delhi hotel early Tuesday. "Deeply saddened by the loss of lives due to a fire at Karol Bagh in Delhi. I convey my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives," he tweeted. He wished for speedy recovery of the injured. At least 17 people were killed in the fire at Arpit Palace Hotel on Gurudwara Road in Karol Bagh.
New Chiefs DE Clark: 'Nothing to hide'  [SEP]  KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Frank Clark held it together through the questions about his checkered past, what he plans to bring to the Kansas City Chiefs and the massive new contract the star pass rusher signed with his new team. The tears finally rolled when he talked about its impact on his family. "You come from a place where, like, in life, you're only given so many shots, or so many opportunities, to do something great for so many people," he said, "and to finally get to a place in my life to do something great for so many generations, man, it's awesome." While other teams were introducing their first-round draft picks Friday, the Chiefs were unveiling their own addition. But rather than a wide-eyed, unproven rookie, Clark happens to be a four-year vet who established himself with the Seattle Seahawks as a dominant and versatile defensive end. The Chiefs acquired the 25-year-old Clark this week for a first-round pick this year and a second-round selection next year. The teams also swapped third-round picks. Kansas City finally made its first selection at No. 56 on Friday night, when it sent a fifth-round pick to the Rams to move up five spots and select Georgia speedster Mecole Hardman. An undersized wide receiver, Hardman ran a 4.33-second 40-yard dash. Throw in his elusiveness and open-field playmaking ability, and it appeared as the Chiefs had drafted a replacement for Tyreek Hill, who is under investigation for his role in a suspected child-abuse case. The Chiefs then used the 63rd overall pick in the second round to select Juan Thornhill, a versatile defensive back from Virginia. He has the speed and ball skills of a cornerback and the ability to defend the run like a safety, making him a good match for new running mate Tyrann Mathieu. They wrapped up the second day of the draft by choosing Khalen Saunders out of Western Illinois in the third round, giving the Chiefs a massive run-stuffer in the middle of their defensive line. Meanwhile, the Chiefs gave Clark a life-changing $105.5 million, five-year deal that includes $63.5 million in guarantees — more money than he could have dreamed of while growing up homeless in the rough, gang-infested neighborhoods of south-central Los Angeles. "I come from a place, dog, where nothing was given. It was hard. It was very hard," he said, "and to be able to affect my family, I swear, it's the happiest thing in my life, knowing that my family can rely on me. There was a time where I felt they couldn't, that I wasn't the role model I could be for my brothers, my sister. It's awesome. It's a blessed feeling, man." Clark's arrival comes at an awkward time for the Chiefs, who are reeling from Hill's criminal investigation. The case was reopened Friday after a TV station aired audio that showed Hill and his fiancee, Crystal Espinal, discussing injuries to their child. Clark has his own off-the-field history. He was kicked off the team at Michigan when he was charged with first-degree domestic violence and assault following an incident with his then-girlfriend. The charges were later reduced to fourth-degree persistent disorderly conduct and Clark completed a domestic violence course and paid court costs and fines. Clark has been outspoken in support of those harmed by domestic violence. He also has worked closely with the homeless community in Seattle, and said he hopes to continue that work in Kansas City. "I've had to learn to be a better teammate, a better person and a better man in general," Clark said. "You have to own up to it and what you did. I affected a lot of people during that. "It's something I have to learn and grow from, and that's why I'm so persistent in bettering myself," he said. "I'm a real person. I don't have nothing to hide. That's just me. Everyone is going to get a chance to know me. I know what they read, I know the perception people can have. The hard part is getting to know someone. Once they do that, they will understand me as a person." The Chiefs certainly like what they see as a football player. Clark plays with a relentless motor, not only when it comes to rushing the passer but also against the run. He also has relatively little wear on his body after starting his career as a backup, and that means there's a good chance he is only now beginning to reach his prime. "This was our plan all along. This was the guy we targeted," Chiefs general manager Brett Veach said. "When we find someone we like, we find a way to get him. We did that with Pat Mahomes. We didn't have a first-round pick last year and it was because we traded up to draft the league MVP." Veach and Chiefs coach Any Reid both said they were comfortable with Clark given the franchise's questionable history when it comes to players with character concerns. Along with Hill's legal trouble, the organization endured a grisly murder-suicide involving linebacker Jovan Belcher and his girlfriend in 2012. Last year, they quickly released star running back Kareem Hunt when video surfaced showing him shoving and kicking a woman in an Ohio hotel hallway.
Ex-Israeli minister gets 11-year jail term after spying for Iran  [SEP]  A former Israeli government minister will serve 11 years in prison after he confessed to spying for Iran. Gonen Segev agreed to a plea deal after admitting 'severe espionage' and passing information to an enemy. Segev, 63, served as energy minister under prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in the mid-1990s. He has previously served prison time for trying to smuggle drugs into the country using an expired diplomatic passport. The ex-minister was extradited from Equatorial Guinea and arrested upon arrival in Israel last May. He was detained on suspicion of acting as an agent for Iranian intelligence and relaying information about the 'energy market and security sites in Israel'. The Shin Bet security service initially said Segev met his operators twice in Iran, and also met Iranian agents in hotels and apartments around the world. Segev's lawyers said the plea bargain for the 11-year sentence removed an initial charge of treason. 'Indeed, Mr Segev did have contact with the Iranians but his motive was not to 'aid an enemy during war',' they said. He was earlier jailed in 2004 for attempting to smuggle 32,000 illegal Ecstasy tablets from the Netherlands to Israel using old diplomatic documents. A former doctor whose medical licence was revoked, Segev was released from prison in Israel in 2007 and had been living in Africa in recent years. Israel considers Iran to be its biggest threat, citing Iranian calls for Israel's destruction, Iran's support for hostile militant groups like Hezbollah and its development of long-range missiles. Israel has been an outspoken critic of the international nuclear deal with Iran and welcomed the US decision to withdraw from the deal. More recently, Israeli forces have carried out a number of air strikes on Iranian forces in neighbouring Syria.
Meghan Markle & Prince Harry Honor Princess Diana By Personally Telling Her Siblings Of Their Baby’s Birth  [SEP]  The British royal family welcomed their newest member early on Monday morning. The official Instagram page for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced the birth of a bouncing baby boy, adding that both mother and baby were doing well — and that the infant weighed a healthy 7 pounds, 3 ounces. A statement from Buckingham Palace revealed that Meghan Markle and Prince Harry paid a touching tribute to Harry’s mother, the late Princess Diana, by making sure her three siblings were among the first to hear about the baby’s birth. Following protocol, Queen Elizabeth II was the first person to hear about the birth of Baby Sussex. However, Diana’s siblings Lady Jane Fellowes, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, and Earl Spencer were also quickly notified of the news, according to The Daily Mail. When Prince Louis was born in the spring of 2018, the queen was told first — then the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, and Prince Harry were informed, in addition to other “members of both families.” In the official announcement of Baby Sussex’s birth, the palace wrote, “The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales, The Duchess of Cornwall, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Lady Jane Fellowes, Lady Sarah McCorquodale and Earl Spencer have been informed and are delighted with the news. The Duchess’s mother, Doria Ragland, who is overjoyed by the arrival of her first grandchild, is with Their Royal Highnesses at Frogmore Cottage.” In interviews with Prince Harry last year, Princess Diana’s and Prince Charles’ youngest son opened up about how hard it had been to lose his mother at the young age of 12. He detailed how he had bottled up his pain for many years before seeking professional counseling, wrote The Daily Mail. The Duke of Sussex went on to admit how the grief had caused him to come close to several mental breakdowns over the years, and had left him feeling very angry inside. Now, Prince Harry has reason to smile, given the birth of his first son. The prince expressed, shortly after the birth, that he was “over the moon” about welcoming his son into the world — and was “incredibly proud” of his wife.
British MPs pass Brexit delay bill with one vote majority – Dominica News Online  [SEP]  Members of the British parliament have voted by a majority of one, to force the prime minister to ask for an extension to the Brexit process in a bid to avoid any no deal scenario. The guardian reported that “A cross-party group of MPs, led by Oliver Letwin and Yvette Cooper, forced through a bill in less than six hours to instruct Theresa May to seek an extension to article 50 and avoid a no-deal Brexit.” Wednesday’s event has been described as rare as backbenchers don’t usually take control of parliamentary business and force through legislation in just one day. The situation has come about because Theresa May has no Commons majority and some Conservative MPs are willing to work with opposition parties to thwart a hard Brexit. The article went on to explain that the bill passed through the Commons by just one vote, is another unusual occurrence. Fiona Onasanya, a former Labour and now independent MP, voted in favour of the bill, prompting outrage among some Brexiters who believe she should have stood down following a jail sentence for repeatedly lying to avoid a speeding charge. Minutes before the narrow first vote, an amendment from Labour’s Hilary Benn, which would have allowed MPs to hold further indicative votes, was blocked in extraordinary circumstances, as the Speaker, John Bercow, was forced to make the casting vote after a tied result. The bill is going to the House of Lords, where there is a strong majority against a hard Brexit. However, there are more opportunities to filibuster in the Lords, where every amendment can be debated and voted on. Some hardline Tory peers may try to talk endlessly to waste time and delay the process but Labour sources in the Lords still believe it is pretty likely to pass though.
Islamic State attacks Syrian army, allies, killing dozens - monitor  [SEP]  BEIRUT (Reuters) - Islamic State attacks on the Syrian army and allied militias in central Syria have killed 35 soldiers over two days, a war monitor said early on Saturday. Although Islamic State lost its last territorial enclave in Syria at Baghouz near the Iraqi border last month to U.S.-backed forces, it still has fighters holding out in the remote central desert. The monitor, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said the attacks constituted Islamic State's biggest military operation since losing Baghouz and involved assaults in several parts of central Syria. The most intense attack was in the al-Koum area north of the ancient desert city of Palmyra, the Observatory said, where Islamic State militants killed 15 Syrian army and allied soldiers. Islamic State said in a message on its Amaq news outlet on Friday that it had killed 20 Syrian soldiers and injured others in the al-Sukhna region between Palmyra and Deir al-Zor in an ambush and clashes. Syrian state news outlets did not carry any reports of Islamic State attacks or of deaths among pro-government forces in clashes with the militant group.

federal judge to block Trump's new abortion rule: media,...  [SEP]  (Reuters) - A federal judge in the U.S. state of Oregon will block a move by the Trump administration to cut off federal money to family planning clinics that offer abortion or refer women to abortion providers, activists and media reports said late on Tuesday. President Donald Trump’s new Title X rule, set to take effect in May, would halt government funds for Planned Parenthood clinics that subsidize birth control for low-income women, and other clinics that provide abortions. Critics say the plan is aimed at fulfilling Trump’s campaign pledge to defund Planned Parenthood, an organization that provides abortions and other health services for women. Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the American Medical Association, along with several other parties, sued in federal court in Oregon to halt the new rule. U.S. District Judge Michael McShane said late on Tuesday that he will grant a preliminary injunction against the new federal restrictions, the Oregonian newspaper reported. It was unclear when the ruling would be made formal and how wide-sweeping it would be. The plaintiffs had sought a national injunction, but Judge McShane said he is reluctant to set national health care policy, the newspaper reported. The U.S. Justice Department, which opposed the injunction in court, asked that it only apply to the plaintiffs in this case, the Oregonian said. McShane said from the bench that the so-called “gag rule” would prevent doctors from doing their jobs, media reports said. The U.S. Justice Department was not available for comment on Wednesday. Congress provided $286 million in Title X grants in 2017 to Planned Parenthood and other health centers to provide birth control, screening for diseases and cancer, and other reproductive counseling to low-income women. The funding cannot be used for abortions, but abortion opponents have long complained that the money subsidizes Planned Parenthood itself. “Judge McShane got it exactly right when he called the new Title X rule a ‘ham-fisted’ approach to health care,” AMA President Barbara McAneny said in a statement. “The judge repeatedly asked how the new gag rule would improve health outcomes. The government was unable to answer,” she added. Leana Wen, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, called it a victory for patients and doctors. But she added in a statement “this relief is preliminary and we will continue to fight the Trump-Pence administration in court and in Congress to ensure our patients’ health.” Similar legal challenges are pending in other federal courts, including one brought by California, according to media reports.
Constance becomes first German city to declare 'climate emergency' | DW | 02.05.2019  [SEP]  The southern German city of Constance has become the first in the nation to pass a resolution declaring a climate emergency. The resolution, which was passed unanimously by the city council on Thursday, was urged by the local chapter of the environmental group Fridays for Future. Read more: Opinion: What actually happened at the Bonn climate conference — and why it matters The resolution has several aims, including a goal to provide a climate-neutral supply of energy to buildings and a new mobility management plan. The plan came about in February when environmentalists approached Mayor Uli Burchardt, who then tasked administrators with developing a provisional plan. "In order to ensure that the passage of this resolution is more than a symbolic act, we have to analyze who can and must contribute to it," said city representatives on Thursday. Members of Fridays for Future said the city had committed to providing annual reports to monitor progress in reducing its carbon emissions. "The Constance city council's climate emergency declaration is an important signal for the whole of Germany," they said in a statement. Read more: Opinion: Germany's climate activism is full of hypocrisy Although it has been acknowledged that the term emergency was not used in the traditional legal sense, council members found it important to acknowledge the acute threat posed by climate change, "and to make stemming the climate crisis and its grave consequences a top priority." A number of cities around the world, including Los Angeles, London, Vancouver, and Basel have recently passed similar resolutions. On Thursday, the British Parliament did so as well.

Central African Republic initials peace deal with 14 armed groups  [SEP]  KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Central African Republic initialed a peace deal with 14 armed groups on Tuesday following two weeks of talks in the Sudanese capital Khartoum. The peace deal was announced on Saturday by the African Union but the terms were not immediately released. Central African Republic has been rocked by violence since 2013 when mainly Muslim Selaka rebels ousted then-president Francois Bozize, prompting reprisals from mostly Christian militias. U.N. peacekeepers were deployed in 2014.
Texas judge rules US military draft only for men unconstitutional  [SEP]  AUSTIN, Texas — A court ruling in Texas declaring the U.S. military draft system unconstitutional because it applies only to men has left observers waiting to see what the government does next. The Justice Department declined comment Monday on the decision that has renewed attention over whether American women should be eligible for a military draft. U.S. District Judge Gray Miller didn't order any immediate action in his decision Friday. But he said the time to "discuss the place of women in the Armed Services" has passed. Former Nevada Rep. Joe Heck is leading a commission looking into whether the draft is still needed. He said Monday the court ruling won't influence their ultimate recommendations to Congress. The lawsuit was brought by the National Coalition for Men, a men's rights group.
Israeli shelling kills Gaza militant after officer wounded  [SEP]  JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli shelling of the Gaza Strip on Tuesday killed a Palestinian militant and wounded four others shortly after an Israeli soldier was shot on the border of the coastal enclave, authorities said. Following the incident, Israel said it would halt a key transfer of Qatari funds to the Gaza Strip. The Israeli military said that an officer was lightly wounded after a bullet hit his helmet "during a riot in the southern Gaza Strip" and that Israeli tanks fired at a Hamas militant position in response. The Gaza health ministry confirmed that the shelling killed a 24-year-old man and injured four people, one seriously. Mahmoud al-Nabahin was a member of Hamas' armed wing known as the Qassam Brigades, the group said in a statement. Later Tuesday, Israeli aircraft carried out multiple strikes on a Hamas military site in northern Gaza Strip, saying the Islamic group bears responsibility for violence emanating from the territory, Israel's military said in a statement. There were no reports of casualties. The violence escalated tensions at a sensitive time for both Gaza's Hamas rulers and Israel. A senior Israeli official said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to halt Wednesday's planned transfer of $15 million in Qatari funds for Hamas to pay salaries for civil servants. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. Netanyahu has previously stipulated that the cash injection was contingent upon calm along the Gaza border. For months, Hamas has held weekly protests along several sections of the Gaza-Israel perimeter fence, driven largely by economic hardship caused by the 11-year Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza. Qatar, a go-between for Hamas and Israel, is trying to mitigate the crisis in Gaza and consequently quieting the protests to prevent an all-out war between Gaza militants and Israel. Since they were launched in March, more than 185 Palestinians were killed in the demonstrations. An Israeli soldier was shot dead in July by a Gaza sniper. Associated Press writer Ilan Ben Zion reported this story in Jerusalem and AP writer Fares Akram reported from Gaza.
The Latest: UN's 20-year envoy on name dispute cheers vote  [SEP]  The Latest: UN's 20-year envoy on name dispute cheers vote ATHENS, Greece (AP) — The Latest on ratification of an agreement to resolve the place name dispute between Greece and Macedonia (all times local): The man who spent 20 years as the U.N.'s mediator in a name dispute between Greece and Macedonia says the Greek parliament's ratification of a reconciliation agreement "ushers in a new era for the consolidation of peace and security in the Balkans." Matthew Nimetz said in a statement that the Friday vote by lawmakers in Athens to endorse the deal also "opens the door to a new relationship" between the countries after the 27-year dispute over rights to the Macedonia name. Under the deal Nimetz helped negotiate, Macedonia will be renamed North Macedonia in return for Greece dropping objections to its membership in NATO and, eventually, the European Union. Macedonia's parliament approved constitutional changes to rename the country North Macedonia on Jan. 11. Nimetz was U.S. President Clinton's envoy in the mediation of the dispute for 1½ years and has been the U.N. secretary-general's representative on the issue since 1999. He says he looks forward to the completion of the process outlined in the agreement. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is praising Greece for the ratification of a deal to end a 27-year naming dispute with neighboring Macedonia, saying it will help promote reconciliation efforts beyond Europe. The Greek parliament approved an agreement on Friday to drop objections to Macedonia's membership in NATO and the European Union if its young neighbor is renamed North Macedonia. Macedonia's parliament approved constitutional changes to rename the country on Jan. 11. U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq says Guterres looks forward to completing the process outlined in the agreement, which was negotiated under U.N. auspices. Haq said: "The secretary-general commends the leaderships of both countries" for an agreement that "will strengthen peace and security in the region and provide a fresh impetus to reconciliation efforts in Europe and beyond." U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has welcomed the Greek parliament's ratification of a deal to end a 27-year dispute over neighboring Macedonia's name. In a statement Friday, Pompeo praised the Greek government's "vision, courage and persistence" in pushing ahead with the historic agreement. He says it will improve regional stability and allow Macedonia to take its "rightful" place in NATO with the new name of North Macedonia. Under the deal, Greece will lift its objections to its northern neighbor joining the alliance in return for the name change. Greece long argued that by taking the name Macedonia, the small country that had been part of the former Yugoslavia implied territorial claims to a northern Greek province of that name and usurped Greek culture and ancient history. Albania and Kosovo have hailed the vote of the Greek parliament ratifying the Macedonia name deal, saying it's a great contribution to regional stability. A statement Friday from Albania's Foreign Ministry considered the vote a "key contribution to stability, development and Euro-Atlantic integration of the whole region." Tirana considered it a "victory of diplomacy coming also as an irreplaceable contribution of the Albanian factor in Macedonia." Ethnic Albanians make up about a quarter of Macedonia's 2.1-million population. Kosovo President Hashim Thaci tweeted congratulations to Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras "for showing vision and courage." Thaci said "it is welcoming news for the whole region and a strong push for efforts to close all open issues between the countries of the Balkans." Britain's foreign secretary has congratulated Greek lawmakers for accepting a deal to resolve the protracted disagreement over the use of the name Macedonia. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt described the Greek parliament's ratification of the agreement on Friday as a "historic moment bringing a decades-old dispute close to an end." The deal will see the young nation of Macedonia renamed North Macedonia in return for Greece dropping objections to its northern neighbor's membership in NATO and, eventually, the European Union. Opposition to the country being called Macedonia has been fierce in Greece, where critics say it implies territorial claims on a Greek province named Macedonia. Hunt says the deal reached between the countries' prime ministers last year "brings the prospect of increased stability and prosperity to the wider region." Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has congratulated Greece following Friday's vote in the Greek Parliament to ratify the deal normalizing relations between the two countries. In a message to the Greek prime minister, Zaev wrote in English on Twitter: "Congratulations my friend, Alexis Tsipras. Together with our peoples we reached a historical victory. Long live the Prespa Agreement! For eternal peace and progress of the Balkans and in Europe!" Both prime ministers faced fierce political opposition and struggled to ratify the deal reached last summer at Lake Prespa, which borders both countries and Albania. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is welcoming the Greek parliament's ratification of the Macedonia name agreement, which paves the way for Skopje to join the world's biggest military alliance. Stoltenberg said in a tweet Friday that the vote is "an important contribution to the stability and prosperity of the whole region." He added: "I look forward to the future Republic of North Macedonia joining NATO." Efforts by the government in Skopje to join NATO have been blocked almost exclusively by the disagreement with ally Greece over the Balkan country's name. Top European Union officials are hailing as a historic moment the Greek parliament's ratification of the Macedonia name agreement, paving the way for the Balkan country to join NATO. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, the EU's top diplomat and the senior official supervising the bloc's enlargement, said jointly Friday that they "warmly welcome" the vote in Athens, which has "written a new page of our common EU future." They say that "it took political courage, leadership and responsibility on all sides to resolve one of the most entrenched disputes in the region. Both countries have seized this unique opportunity, which sets an example of reconciliation for Europe as a whole and will give a further boost to the European perspective of the region." Greek lawmakers have ratified an agreement for the country to drop its objections to neighboring Macedonia joining NATO if the small country's name is changed to North Macedonia. The deal faced fierce opposition and had already cost Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras his parliamentary majority. It passed Friday with the support of independent lawmakers. The ratification vote came after three days of acrimonious debate on the deal, which aimed to end a nearly three decade-long dispute that has kept Macedonia from joining the western military alliance and the European Union. Greece has long argued use of the term Macedonia implied territorial claims on its own northern province of the same name, and usurped its culture and ancient Greek history. Greek lawmakers are to wrap up three days of acrimonious parliamentary debate with a vote on a deal normalizing relations with Macedonia, under which Greece's northern neighbor will rename itself North Macedonia and Athens will drop its objections to the country joining NATO. More protests were scheduled in Athens and the northern city of Thessaloniki Friday. Opposition is particularly fierce in the northern Greek region of Macedonia, which borders the former Yugoslav republic that claimed the same name after declaring independence in 1991. Critics claim the deal signs away their identity and a cultural heritage dating back to Alexander the Great more than 2,300 years ago. The agreement has already cost Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras his parliamentary majority after the right-wing Independent Greeks quit the governing coalition in protest.
Supreme Court allows Trump administration to implement transgender restrictions in military  [SEP]  The Supreme Court is allowing the Trump administration to go ahead with its plan to restrict military service by transgender people while court challenges continue.The high court on Tuesday reversed lower-court orders preventing the Pentagon from implementing its plans. But the high court for now declined to take up cases about the plan. The cases will continue to move through lower courts.Military policy had barred service by transgender people until President Barack Obama's administration began allowing transgender people already in the military to serve openly and set a date when transgender people would be allowed to enlist.President Donald Trump's administration has revisited those policies. The Trump administration has sought to generally restrict service by transgender people to only those who do not seek to undergo gender transitions.
New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft charged with hiring a prostitute  [SEP]  JUPITER, Fla. - Police in Florida have charged New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft with misdemeanor solicitation of prostitution, saying they have videotape of him paying for a sex act inside an illicit massage parlor. Jupiter police told reporters Friday that the 77-year-old Kraft hasn't been arrested. A warrant will be issued and his attorneys will be notified. The charge comes amid a widespread crackdown on sex trafficking in the area surrounding Palm Beach County. About 200 arrest warrants have been issued in recent days and more are expected. The Patriots won the Super Bowl earlier this month in Atlanta. The team did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Russian Church Fires Back After St. Petersburg Choir Draws A Nuclear Bead On Washington  [SEP]  A choral reinterpretation of a Cold War ditty depicting a Russian nuclear attack on Washington has variously drawn wild cheers, contrition, and ridicule for its glib message amid mounting nuclear tensions between Russia and the West. The St. Petersburg Concert Choir capped its appearance in that northern capital's main cathedral on Defenders of the Fatherland Day with the song On The Wages Of Servicemen, which was written in 1980 by singer-songwriter Andrei Kozlovsky: The song's first verse describes a nuclear submarine with "a dozen little bombs of 100 megatons each" crossing the Atlantic. "I call to the targeting officer," the lyric goes, "'Take aim, Petrov, at Washington!'" It continues in the same spirit and ends with the line, May the land of the enemy burn to pieces." The St. Petersburg eparchy of the Russian Orthodox Church eventually expressed regret over the February 23 show. "Choir performances are held regularly in St. Isaac's Cathedral, and the fact that appropriate music is performed is not a problem," the press office of the Petersburg metropolitan said on February 26. "But this song performed by a fairly well-known choir, of course, is surprising." "We regret that this happened in St. Petersburg, and particularly in St. Isaac's," the statement concluded. When it was written, Kozlovsky's song humorously referenced the awesome responsibilities carried out by Soviet servicemen for paltry wages. "I can do anything for 3 rubles," goes the refrain. The performance stuck a nerve with many observers as video of it went viral on social media. It comes at a time of elevated nuclear tensions between the United States and Russia as Washington has accused Moscow of violating the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and announced its withdrawal from that 1987 agreement. During his state-of-the-nation address to the Federal Assembly on February 20, President Vladimir Putin praised new Russian high-tech nuclear weapons and said: "Our American colleagues have tried to gain absolute military supremacy by creating a global missile-defense system. They need to give up such illusions. Our response will always be real and effective." On February 23, state television commentator Dmitry Kiselyov ran a bellicose segment that showed a map of the United States depicting targets he said would be hit in the event of a nuclear war, including the Pentagon and the U.S. presidential retreat Camp David outside Washington. Nonetheless, Vladimir Berletsov, director of the St. Petersburg Concert Choir, called critics of the performance "f***ing idiots," noting that "the audience gave a standing ovation." Igor Stakheyev, press secretary of the St. Isaac's museum complex, told the website znak.com that "the song was definitely inappropriate." "The museum director is awaiting an explanation from the management of the choir," he added. St. Petersburg Archdeacon Andrei Kurayev noted that in Soviet times, the song "was taken as satire of Soviet propaganda." "But these days, in such a super-serious performance, there is no way to take it as a joke," he added. With reporting by znak.com, The Insider, and Interfax
Brussels extends Brexit deadline to 12 April as Theresa May fails to convince EU of orderly exit if MPs shoot down deal  [SEP]  Brussels: Over an agonising two-hour grilling, British Prime Minister Theresa May failed to convince exasperated European leaders she has any plan to deliver an orderly Brexit if MPs vote her withdrawal deal down. Tightlipped and evasive, she parried questions until EU chiefs asked her to leave Thursday's summit meeting and embarked on a negotiation among themselves to draw up a new Brexit timetable. "British politicians are today incapable of implementing what the people asked for," France's president Emmanuel Macron declared. EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker was "at the end of his tether", one diplomatic source told AFP. May's government is in crisis and she has proved unable to muster a majority to approve the Brexit withdrawal deal struck at a previous Brussels get-together in November. With a potentially catastrophic "no deal" departure looming on 29 March, the other 27 EU leaders were determined to take charge, and came to Brussels armed with the clear plan. As set out by host EU Council president Donald Tusk and in draft conclusions leaked to the media, they offered to postpone Brexit to 22 May if British MPs backed the prime minister's withdrawal agreement. But the leaders wanted to know what she would do if the deal fails again — as most observers believe is likely. "She replied that she has no plan B, but was sticking to plan A," one source said. "She didn't have answers to all the questions," Luxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Bettel told reporters on Friday morning. Once May had left the room, Macron told the meeting that he had arrived believing there was a 10 percent chance that May would succeed, according to several European sources. But, after hearing from her, he said: "I think there is a five percent chance". To which Tusk retorted: "You are very optimistic." While May lurked in her delegation's office space, and the leaders argued over dinner, a new conclusions document was drawn up. After six hours, they eventually agreed to add to their original offer an unconditional proposal to delay Brexit to 12 April. They were forced to postpone a planned discussion on relations with China — for which May had been due to rejoin them, over dinner — as different leaders set out different options. "It was very intense," said Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, a reflection echoed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel. At a press conference afterwards, Tusk insisted there was no rancour. "It was first and foremost a discussion about all possible scenarios. What if, what if — nobody knows," an EU source said. May stayed in the building, and was briefed three times by Tusk — once before the talks, once during a break and again after they finally reached an agreement at 11.20pm. Some of her team followed developments as they leaked out onto Twitter, with one official admitting afterwards that some of the options considered "would have been quite challenging". In the end, Britain accepted the offer, even if it fell short of May's proposal for a delay until 30 June, and several European leaders expressed satisfaction at the result. Belgian prime minister Charles Michel said the EU "hoped for a rational choice" from Britain, but there remains intense frustration at the deadlock in parliament. The EU had previously floated the idea of an emergency summit next week if MPs reject May's deal, but Macron warned this would put the responsibility to decide onto the leaders. "The EU doesn't have all the cards, because everything depends on the British vote," Macron told a late-night press conference. And Croatian prime minister Andrej Plenkovic said: "We're a little bit careful given the history of votes." The discussion over the extension threatened to undermine the unity of the 27, which has held remarkably well since Britain's 2016 referendum. But diplomats said that leaders are determined that Brexit wranglings will not disrupt preparations for European Parliament elections in May. "Now Brexit touches really the core of the functioning of the European Union," one said.

Scientists just got closer to solving one of astronomy’s biggest mysteries | The Star  [SEP]  These are fast radio bursts, some of the most enigmatic phenomena in astronomy. Scientists don’t know where they come from, or what celestial event could be so dramatic yet common enough to produce thousands of bursts every day. Imagine a flash of radio energy so powerful it outshines the sun. Now imagine a flash like this going off nearly every minute all across the cosmos. One of the newly detected bursts is a rare “repeater” — researchers saw six flashes coming from the same spot in the sky, which they hope will make it easier to pin down the source of the signal. Only one other repeating FRB has ever been found. But they think they’re closing in on an answer. At the winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society this week, researchers at a powerful new Canadian telescope announced the detection of 13 new fast radio bursts (FRBs) in a mere two months of observations — a 20 per cent increase over the five dozen bursts that have been found in the past 12 years. “These things are coming to us from halfway across the universe and we don’t really know anything about them,” said McGill University’s Shriharsh Tendulkar, a lead author of one of two papers in the journal Nature about the new findings. “Isn’t that exciting?” CHIME has been fully operational since September. Scientists on the project have hinted that at least 100 more bursts will be reported in the weeks to come. Work on the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME), which Tendulkar and his colleagues used for their research, was not quite complete when this initial baker’s dozen was detected last July and August. But the cylindrical instrument, which maps a 3-degree-wide swath of the sky every night, was already a dramatic improvement on more traditional telescopes, which can only focus on a single spot. “With fast radio bursts, it’s always felt like the more answers we get, the more questions we have,” said Sarah Burke-Spolaor, an astrophysicist at West Virginia University who was not involved in the new research. “But I think we’re reaching the peak of that mountain.” Cornell University’s Shami Chatterjee, a fellow FRB researcher, agreed: “This field is about to break wide open.” When the first fast radio burst was detected, in 2007, many scientists thought it had to be a result of some telescopic mix-up. The signals are so brief, they must come from something incredibly small (no bigger than New Jersey) yet they pack as much energy into a millisecond as the sun emits all day. They are also dispersed — high frequency wavelengths arrive earlier than lower-frequency ones — which suggest that they travel long distances across vast expanses of space to reach astronomers’ radio dishes. Scientists have scores of theories about what might create such stupendous signals — spinning cores of collapsed stars, powerful magnetic fields around black holes, the fog of dust and gas from which new stars form. But only one burst has ever been traced back to its source: a repeating burst called FRB 121102, which flickers periodically from a dim dwarf galaxy 3 billion light-years away. The repeater detected by CHIME bears a strong resemblance to FRB 121102, said Dunlap Institute astrophysicist Cherry Ng, lead author of the second Nature paper. Both have what Ng calls “structure” — distinctive patterns in the timing and frequency of the signals. “It’s really tempting . . . to think that this is maybe a defining feature,” Ng said. “But we have to be careful. We still have a sample size of only two.” The CHIME researchers are working with an array of antennas in central New Mexico to pin down the galaxy to which the second repeater belongs. (The fact that it repeats gives them a good chance of spotting it again.) They hope that tracing the radio signal back a known visible object may reveal what produced it. But that’s just one of the riddles associated with this “fantastic phenomenon,” said Tendulkar. Scientists are still debating whether repeating FRBs come from the same source as the one-time flashes, or instead represent a distinct type of event. They don’t know whether the bursts are like flashbulbs, lighting up the sky in every direction, or focused beams, which would require less energy but must be more frequent for Earth to see so many of them. It’s within the realm of possibility, he said, that there are several types of FRB, each created by a different kind of celestial cataclysm. The mystery of fast radio bursts has always been a large part of their appeal, Ng said. “I think we are just drawn to anything unknown.” But she is just as thrilled by the revelations that will emerge from solving this mystery. FRBs are among the few types of signal that interact with the diffuse fog of electrons that exists between galaxies. If scientists can figure out how FRBs ought to look when they leave their sources, they may be able to probe the intergalactic medium by studying the way the signals change. “We are very far from that yet,” Ng said. But she says the promise is what keeps her working. “It could be a start to a whole new field in astronomy.”
Trump calls Mueller and team wrong people , trying to bullshit  [SEP]  "I had a nasty business transaction with Robert Mueller a number of years ago. I said, why wasn't that mentioned? He wanted the job as FBI director. I did not give it to him. Why isnÃÂ¢ÃÂ¿ÃÂ¿t that mentioned?"ÃÂ Trump argued Washington D.C.: US President Donald Trump on Saturday (local time) addressed Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team of prosecutors as 'wrong people', adding that those people "tried to take him out with bullshit". "Unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions, and they leave people for a long time that should not be there. All of a sudden, they are trying to take you out with bullshit," Trump said on the last day of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) 2019. The remarks by the President came after the US Justice Department on February 23 confirmed that Mueller would not be delivering his report on Russian interference in the 2016 US Presidential election next week. Fox News quoted the President as saying that the reports were produced "by people who werenâ¿¿t elected." "I had a nasty business transaction with Robert Mueller a number of years ago. I said, why wasn't that mentioned? He wanted the job as FBI director. I did not give it to him. Why isnâ¿¿t that mentioned?"ÂÂ Trump argued. Mueller's findings have so far indicted close Trump aides for their activities during the 2016 elections. Roger Stone, a long time friend and advisor of Trump's is one of the most recent indictments, where Mueller's team has found Stone guilty of making "multiple false statements" about his interactions regarding WikiLeaks. Before this, Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen was handed a three-year prison sentence for lying to the US Congress, violating campaign finance laws and tax evasion, in December. He has pleaded guilty to Mueller's charge of lying to the US Congress regarding the timeline of talks regarding a proposed Trump Tower in Moscow which took place during the same time as Trump's Presidential campaign.

Arata Isozaki, Whose Hybrid Style Forged 'New Paths,' Wins Pritzker Prize  [SEP]  Arata Isozaki spent much of his childhood in the shadow of World War II. As a native of the city of Oita, the Japanese architect grew up just across a slim body of water from Hiroshima, where the U.S. dropped the first atomic bomb — and he says he saw firsthand the ease with which proud human achievements could be leveled. "It was in complete ruins, and there was no architecture, no buildings and not even a city. Only barracks and shelters surrounded me," Isozaki, now 87, recalls in a recorded statement. "So, my first experience of architecture was the void of architecture, and I began to consider how people might rebuild their homes and cities." Isozaki won the Pritzker Architecture Prize on Tuesday, a lifetime achievement award so prestigious, it's often known as the Nobel Prize for architects. And according to the prize's judges, it was in part Isozaki's endless attempts to rebuild — to make something new from old forms, to experiment on the edge of what's possible — that earned him the honor. "Clearly, he is one of the most influential figures in contemporary world architecture - on a constant search, not afraid to change and try new ideas. His architecture rests on profound understanding, not only of architecture but also of philosophy, history, theory and culture," reads the citation of the Pritzker jury, which was chaired this year by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. "He has brought together East and West, not through mimicry or as a collage, but through the forging of new paths." Isozaki's best-known works span the globe — from Tokyo to Milan, from Los Angeles to Doha, Qatar. They include the Shanghai Symphony Hall, a curving saddle of a building in the midst of the Chinese metropolis, and the Center of Science and Industry, a gently bending fixture of Columbus, Ohio. In Barcelona, his Palau Sant Jordi arena became a major venue at the 1992 Summer Olympics. And in more than a quarter-century since those Olympic Games, the massive structure has played host to some of the world's biggest athletes and celebrities — even as it came to be a star in its own right, frequently featured on postcards of the Spanish city. But, as the jury noted, Isozaki was not selected for his buildings alone. "He has set an example of generosity," its citation added, "as he supports other architects and encourages them in competitions or through collaborative works." David Gauld, an architect based in New York City, was among the younger practitioners whose careers Isozaki helped foster. Gauld studied under the Pritzker laureate at Harvard University and worked directly with him for years afterwards. "He's my mentor," Gauld says, "and in many ways, my hero." "He doesn't have a signature style. Like, some architects do a similar kind of style or look no matter what what the project is, no matter what the program is and no matter what the site is. Their buildings have a kind of similar look," Gauld says. "It was always [Isozaki's] approach to do something specific for the site, for the program. And so, consequently, no two of his buildings look alike." Case in point: LA's Museum of Contemporary Art, which Isozaki designed in the 1980s. The museum's director, Klaus Biesenbach, who calls the building "a jewel out of its time," says the brilliance of the structure resides at least partly in how well suited it is, both to its environment and to the artworks it houses. "So I think it's actually a very LA piece, because it has this sunken pool quality, with beautiful skylights, but it's also a very much dedicated to the art that this museum is famous for," Biesenbach explains. Isozaki becomes the eighth Japanese architect to win the Pritzker since it was founded four decades ago. Along with the honor, he receives a bronze medal and a $100,000 grant. Below, you can find a brief gallery of some of Isozaki's most recognizable works — structures plucked from a body of work spans roughly six decades. "He never merely replicated the status quo but challenged it," the Pritzker jury writes. "And in his search for meaningful architecture, he created buildings of great quality that to this day defy categorizations, reflect his constant evolution, and are always fresh in their approach."

Thailand’s king appoints his consort as queen  [SEP]  BANGKOK — Thailand’s King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who will have his official coronation on Saturday, has appointed his consort as the country’s queen. An announcement Wednesday in the Royal Gazette said Suthida Vajiralongkorn Na Ayudhya is legally married to the 66-year-old king, and is now Queen Suthida. Although she has been in the public eye for about three years, there has been little official information about her. She is reported to be 40 years old and to have previously worked as a flight attendant for Thai Airways International. She joined the palace guard in 2014 and is commander of the king’s bodyguard unit, currently holding a general’s rank. Vajiralongkorn, who has had three previous marriages, became king after the death in October 2016 of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Copyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

For Jussie Smollett, 1 story equals 16 felony counts | The Star  [SEP]  CHICAGO - News that a grand jury had indicted “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett for allegedly lying to Chicago police about being attacked by two masked men may not have made much of a splash except for one thing: The lone felony count that Smollett had been arrested on last month had turned into 16. The reasons Smollett is facing 16 counts rather than just one count of disorderly conduct — the felony in Illinois that people are charged with when accused of lying to police — are not fully explained in the indictment that a grand jury returned Thursday. But legal experts say indictments like that aren’t uncommon in Chicago, and there are some explanations as to how the grand jury could have arrived at the 16 counts, eight of them for Smollett’s comments to a police officer and eight others for what he told a detective. The first starts with something that has been apparent since Chicago police Superintendent Eddie Johnson briefed reporters last month on the investigation: Authorities are angry at Smollett. “What you have is a police department and prosecutors that are obviously mad at him for embarrassing the city so they took every one of his lies and made it into another count,” said Terry Sullivan, a prominent local attorney who as a young prosecutor helped convict serial killer John Wayne Gacy in 1980 of killing 33 young men. Smollett’s attorney, Mark Geragos called the 16-count indictment “prosecutorial overkill.” But prominent Chicago defence attorney Joseph Lopez, who is not involved in the Smollett case, said it’s the way prosecutors in Chicago do business. “It is common practice for the Cook County state’s attorney to charge as much as they can for any kind of crime,” he said. A former state appellate judge suggested such a strategy might be employed by prosecutors trying to protect themselves from the possibility that a jury or a judge might believe some, but not all, of the allegations. “If you only charge him with one or two counts and they find him not guilty of them, you’re done,” said David Erickson, who now teaches at Chicago Kent College of Law. “This gives the prosecution the ability to convict him of any one of these lies.” Lopez said it appears that when prosecutors went to the grand jury they simply dissected the case, breaking Smollett’s account into each individual pieces and accuse him of one count per detail they believe he made up. That means that one count might stem from Smollett’s contention that the men hurled racial and homophobic taunts at him and another for what he said was the way they beat him. Another could be tied to his claim that the men doused him with an unknown chemical and another still for his statement that one of them looped a rope tied like a noose around his neck. Then there was his assertion, police said, that he could see one of the men was white because he could see the skin around his eyes. The two men police say Smollett hired to take part in the attack are both black. Another explanation for the multiple counts is that perhaps Smollett gave multiple statements to the police, meaning that individual counts represent separate interviews with police. But Lopez finds that unlikely because all the counts list the same date — Jan. 29. Each count is a Class 4 felony, which carries a possible prison sentence of one to three years. If Smollett is convicted, a judge could allow him to be given probation instead of imposing a prison sentence. Lopez and Erickson agreed that if Smollett is convicted, it won’t matter whether it’s on one or several counts when it comes to sentencing. That’s because he would be sentenced for only one of them. “If you add them all up it’s still only one crime,” Erickson said. “That’s just how it is.” Smollett’s legal troubles may not begin and end with this one indictment. Johnson told reporters that police suspect that Smollett sent to Chicago studio where “Empire” is shot a letter threatening the actor. The FBI, which is investigating that letter, has declined to comment on the investigation. But if he did talk to the FBI, depending on what he said, he could be in more legal trouble. “Lying to the FBI is a crime,” said Erickson. Smollett is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday, where he will likely enter a formal plea to the 16 counts. “Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption,” Geragos, his attorney, said.

Alternative for Germany politician in hospital after being injured in attack  [SEP]  A local leader of the Alternative for Germany party has been attacked and injured in the city of Bremen. Bremen police said they believe the attack on Frank Magnitz, an MP in Germany’s national parliament who leads the party’s local branch, was politically motivated. They called for witnesses to the attack, which took place early on Monday evening near a city theatre, to come forward. Mr Magnitz was beaten over the head with an unidentified object by at least three men wearing dark clothing and hoods or hats, who then fled, police said. Blood on the ground in Bremen (Helmut Reuter/dpa/AP) Two workers who were loading a car nearby found him lying on the ground and called an ambulance. The 66-year-old was taken to hospital. The party, known by its German acronym AfD, said earlier that he was ambushed by three masked men, beaten unconscious with a piece of wood and then kicked in the head. “It was clearly an attempt to murder Mr Magnitz,” AfD co-leader Alexander Gauland told reporters in Berlin. “This is the result of the ostracism and agitation AfD faces,” he said, suggesting other parties were partly responsible for the attack because they had compared AfD to the Nazis. The party claims there have been “hundreds” of attacks against its members since its founding in 2013. Last week, an explosion outside one of its offices in the eastern town of Doebeln damaged windows and doors. AfD distributed a photo of Mr Magnitz lying on a hospital trolley, showing a bloody, gaping wound on his head and his right eye bruised and swollen. He told the dpa news agency he had been told he would need to remain in hospital until the weekend and had little memory of the attack. He added that while he had received threats, he had not considered any of them concrete. He is associated with the right wing of the party, including its firebrand leader in the eastern state of Thuringia, Bjoern Hoecke. Bremen, Germany’s smallest state, holds a regional election on May 26, the same day as European Parliament elections in which AfD hopes to make gains. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who has been a strong critic of AfD, tweeted: “Violence must never be a means of political confrontation — no matter against whom or what the motives are.” “There is no justification for this,” he said, calling for those responsible to be punished. That was echoed by other politicians from established parties, including prominent Green party politician Cem Ozdemir, who said that AfD must be countered by legal means, not violence. “Anyone who fights hatred with hatred always lets hatred win in the end,” he wrote on Twitter. AfD is represented in all of Germany’s 16 state parliaments. It entered the national parliament in 2017 and is currently the biggest opposition party there.
Dust Advisory Back On For Quesnel  [SEP]  It was a short reprieve from a dust advisory. The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy in collaboration with Northern Health reissued an advisory Friday afternoon for Quesnel. “Over the last 24 hours the roads have dried out again,” said air quality meteorologist, Ralph Adams. “I was in Quesnel last night and the roads were actually quite wet, but by the time I left the roads were drying out again so there is a forecast now for a period of this same sunny weather with low winds and that’s precisely the weather that gives rise to these high dust levels.” Adams said he expects unless the weather changes and until that material is picked off the streets we’re going to have these repeating dust events. “The traction material that’s on has been ground up over the winter and it’s now lying on or beside the road and as the cars go by or right over it, it kicks up the dust so the more traffic there is and the faster the vehicles are going you tend to get more dust,” he said. “That’s why as a rule of thumb if you’re sensitive to dust and you’re trying to avoid dust, it’s best to avoid busy roads with high traffic and or very heavy traffic like trucks and buses because they have more turbulence behind them and they tend to pick up more dust than say a car or a small pickup truck.”
Waves of 2020 Democratic candidates expected to announce  [SEP]  DES MOINES, Iowa — After months of speculation and secrecy, the 2020 presidential primary season is about to explode into public view. Several Democrats are already in the race, but a half dozen more are locking down final travel, staffing and strategy preparations to launch White House bids in the coming weeks. While plans may change in some cases, the announcements are expected to come in waves, the first featuring a group of ambitious Senate Democrats including New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. The second wave will likely include political heavyweights like former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke. Interviews with senior aides for several top Democratic prospects reveal that the waiting game is almost over.
Pulwama attack masterminded by Jaish, ISI; those who pick up gun will be eliminated: corps commander  [SEP]  Srinagar: The Pulwama suicide bombing was masterminded by Jaish-e-Mohammed and Pakistan’s ISI, a senior Army officer said on Tuesday, five days after 40 CRPF personnel were martyred in one of the deadliest terror attacks in the Valley. Corps Commander Lt Gen K J S Dhillon of the Chinar Corps said this in a joint press conference by IG Kashmir S P Pani and IG CRPF Zulfiqar Hasan. He also said he requested mothers of Kashmiri militants to persuade their sons to surrender.’ “Anyone who picks up the gun will be eliminated,” the officer said. According to Dhillon, security forces had been tracking the top leadership of the JeM since the February 14 bombing in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district. “We have eliminated the top commander who carried out the Pulwama attack,” Dhillon said. On Monday, three JeM terrorists were killed in a 16-hour encounter in Pinglan in Pulwama district, about 12 km from the site of the February 14 attack. An Army major and five others were also killed.

Instagram strips Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro of his blue check mark  [SEP]  The U.S. government has recognized his rival Juan Guaidó‏ as new interim president. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence lined up against him. A U.S. senator called him a terrorist. And now this. Instagram has apparently stripped Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro of his “verified” status on Instagram. Surely this will be the final straw that breaks Maduro politically in Venezuela. We’ll see. It’s unclear why the blue check mark vanished, but the politician’s loss of popularity might have something to do with it. (He said earlier today that Venezuela is breaking diplomatic relations with the United States.) The Facebook-owned social media site says it verifies accounts it believes are “in the public interest.” Blue checks are awarded to accounts that “represent a well-known, highly searched-for person, brand, or entity.” Despite his political status, Maduro is undeniably popular–and certainly newsworthy. Instagram didn’t immediately respond to requests for an explanation.
Former Maldives president makes comeback with landslide win  [SEP]  MALÉ: The exiled former leader of the Maldives has led his party to a landslide victory only five months after returning to the country, preliminary results showed on Sunday (Apr 7). Ex-president Mohamed Nasheed, 51, was set for a dramatic return to the top of the national parliament, with his Maldivian Democratic Party headed for a two-thirds majority in the 87-member assembly. Saturday's poll was the first test of public opinion since autocratic former president and Nasheed's arch-rival Abdulla Yameen was forced to stand down after his five-year term, facing charges of money laundering and embezzlement. Nasheed returned to the country after his former deputy President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih won an unexpected victory in September presidential elections for the MDP. Yameen had barred Nasheed from contesting. Preliminary results from Saturday's election showed the MDP winning 50 out of the 87 seats, while private media reports projected the party eventually getting up to 68 seats. "The Maldives is about to welcome a new dawn, a golden yellow dawn," Nasheed told his supporters in Male on Saturday. Yellow is the colour of his party. Election officials estimated the final turnout to be between 70 and 80 per cent, down from the 89 percent recorded at the September presidential election which unexpectedly toppled Yameen. Nasheed, now set to take over the leadership of the legislature, has promised to turn the country into a parliamentary democracy by scrapping the executive presidential system adopted under political reforms in 2008. President Solih said in a statement that the MDP had "secured a huge majority in Majlis (parliament)". "While we celebrate, we must also not forget the immense challenges that lie ahead of us," he said. Solih campaigned for the MDP asking voters to return a parliament that could work with him to deliver on his election promises in September to investigate corruption under Yameen. While Yameen was not a candidate, his Progressive Party of Maldives was seen as the main challenger to the MDP - but ended up with a poor showing, and is projected to get only four seats. Nasheed was jailed for 13 years on a controversial terrorism charge when Yameen was in power. However, the conviction was overturned last year after the presidency changed. Election commissioner Ahmed Shareef told reporters there had been no complaints of irregularities in the runup to the vote, during balloting or at the count. The Maldives was on the verge of being slapped with Western-led sanctions before Solih won the presidential election on a pledge to end corruption in the country best known for its luxury tourism.
Flash floods, slides in eastern Indonesia kill at least 50  [SEP]  A disaster official say days of torrential downpours have triggered flash floods and mudslides in mountainside villages in Indonesia's easternmost province, killing at least 50 people and injuring 59 others. National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said the disasters in Papua province's Jayapura district submerged hundreds of houses in neck-high water and mud. They also destroyed roads and bridges, hampering rescue efforts. He said 50 bodies had been pulled from the mud and wreckage of crumpled homes by Sunday, and another 59 people were hospitalized, many with broken bones. The dead included three children who drowned after the floods began late Saturday. He said the number of dead will likely increase since many affected areas have not been reached. More than 4,000 were people are in temporary shelters.
Factory tour for North Korea's Kim on secretive Beijing visit  [SEP]  A vehicle in the motorcade of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Beijing, China on Jan 9, 2019. [BEIJING] North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reportedly visited a pharmaceutical factory in China on Wednesday as he seeks economic support from his key ally along with diplomatic backing before his expected summit with Donald Trump. Kim arrived in Beijing on Tuesday for a fourth visit to his country's sole major diplomatic friend, a trip seen as a strategy session ahead of his possible second meeting with the US president on Pyongyang's nuclear programme. The unannounced trip has been largely shrouded in secrecy. Beyond confirming his presence in Beijing, there has been no detail provided from either the North Korean or Chinese side on his schedule. The North Korean leader met for one hour with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday - believed to be Kim's birthday - and the two later dined with their wives at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. The meeting focused on Kim's expected meeting with Mr Trump, according to Yonhap. But Chinese officials also likely want to impress on Kim - who has so far pursued only limited reforms to his statist economy - the benefits the giant Communist country has enjoyed in its transformation from impoverished nation to economic powerhouse. A motorcade left Beijing's Diaoyutai guest house for foreign dignitaries early Wednesday, with a high police presence and traffic blocked for the convoy. Yonhap reported that Kim toured a factory operated by medicine firm Tongrentang for about half an hour in an economic zone in the Chinese capital. "For North Korea itself, 2019 is his strategic turning point. If he wants to shift his focus to the development of the economy, he needs China's cooperation," said Lu Chao, a North Korea expert at China's Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences. "China will also introduce some successful experiences to Kim to help North Korea achieve economic transformation and realise the denuclearisation of the peninsula as soon as possible," Mr Lu told AFP. Hua Po, a Beijing-based political commentator, said changes in the economic model will affect politics, "which poses new challenges to his control over the country." "For this point, he must ask for advice from China." The motorcade likely carrying Kim was later seen leaving Zhongnanhai, China's central leadership compound next to Beijing's Forbidden City. Kim wraps up his visit - his longest trip to China - on Thursday. In a New Year speech, Kim focused on North Korea's moribund economy, saying that improving people's lives was his top priority and tackling energy shortages was an urgent task. But his looming summit with Trump is a pressing issue. In his speech, he warned that Pyongyang may change its approach to nuclear talks if Washington persists with sanctions. Relations between China and North Korea had deteriorated in recent years over Pyongyang's nuclear activities, but Kim has made sure to keep Mr Xi informed about his dealings with the United States and South Korea and ties appear to have warmed. "In order to resist the high pressure of the US, he must communicate with Xi in advance to see what steps he can take to deal with Trump," Mr Hua said. "Kim needs the support of Xi so as to ask the US to make substantial steps, such as providing assistance to North Korea and normalising relations with North Korea," Mr Hua said. Kim chose China for his maiden official trip abroad last year before holding meetings with South Korean President Moon Jae In and Mr Trump. Mr Trump said Sunday that the United States and North Korea are negotiating the location of their next summit. Discussions between the US and North Korea over Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal have stalled since Kim and Mr Trump's high-profile summit in Singapore in June where they issued a vaguely worded declaration about denuclearisation. The United States insists that United Nations sanctions must remain in place until North Korea gives up its weapons, while Pyongyang wants them immediately eased. China also wants the sanctions to be relaxed. The visit coincides with negotiations between US and Chinese officials in Beijing to resolve a bruising trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Some analysts say China could use its cooperation on the North Korean issue as a bargaining chip in the US trade talks. But Mr Hua said Kim's visit would have a "limited" effect on the trade negotiations. "The Sino-US trade negotiations are a matter between China and the US. The weight of North Korea is limited and cannot play a decisive role," he said.
The Latest: Graham eyes FBI use of dossier in Russia probe  [SEP]  The Latest: Graham eyes FBI use of dossier in Russia probe WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on the conclusion of the special counsel's Russia investigation (all times local): The Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee says his panel will "unpack the other side of the story" of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into President Donald Trump and his campaign. Sen. Lindsey Graham, who spent the weekend with Trump in Florida, said his committee will investigate the actions of the Justice Department in the Russia investigation, including the FBI's use of a dossier compiled by British spy Christopher Steele. Graham spoke Monday after Attorney General William Barr reported to Congress on Mueller's findings. Barr said Mueller found no evidence that Trump or his associates conspired with Russia. Mueller did not make a determination on whether Trump obstructed justice. Graham said he will be speaking with Barr at noon and wants him to testify before his committee. Vice President Mike Pence is claiming that special counsel Robert Mueller has delivered "total vindication" of President Donald Trump. Pence said Monday that despite the two-year Russia investigation and what he described as "reckless accusations by many Democrats and members of the media" the special counsel confirmed "there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 election." Pence claimed that Attorney General William Barr "also confirmed that there was no obstruction of justice." But according to Barr, Mueller reached no conclusion on whether there was obstruction of justice. Pence spoke at an annual convention of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders says President Donald Trump will let the attorney general decide whether the special counsel's Russia report should be publicly released, though she adds that "he's more than happy for any of this stuff to come out." Sanders spoke to NBC's "Today" show Monday as White House aides and allies blanketed television news broadcasts to trumpet a summary of the report that said that Robert Mueller did not find evidence that Trump's campaign "conspired or coordinated" with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election. Asked last week about publicly releasing the report, Trump said: "Let it come out. Let people see it. That's up to the attorney general." Asked whether Trump would support release of the report, Sanders told NBC, "I don't think the president has any problem with it," but stressed the decision was up to Attorney General William Barr. Barr issued a four page summary of Mueller's findings Sunday. Democrats are demanding the full report. Special counsel Robert Mueller did not find evidence that President Donald Trump's campaign "conspired or coordinated" with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election but reached no conclusion on whether Trump obstructed justice. That from Attorney General William Barr on Sunday. The report brought a hearty claim of vindication from Trump but set the stage for new rounds of political and legal fighting. Trump cheered the outcome but also laid bare his resentment after two years of investigations that have shadowed his administration. Democrats pointed out that Mueller found evidence for and against obstruction and demanded to see his full report. They insisted that even the summary by the president's attorney general hardly put him in the clear.
Six killed in IAF's Mi-17 chopper crash: Sources  [SEP]  All six officers on board the Mi-17 V5 helicopter of Indian Air Force were killed after it crashed in Jammu and Kashmir's Budgam on Wednesday morning, according to sources. "All six air warriors on board the helicopter suffered fatal injuries," sources told ANI. The Mi-17 V5 chopper that took off from Srinagar airfield at around 10 AM for a routine mission crashed around 10:10 AM, just 10 minutes after it went airborne. A court of inquiry has been set up to probe the matter. The crash comes a day after India carried out air strikes at Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. Meanwhile, earlier in the day India said it had foiled an attempt by Pakistan Air Force this morning to carry out strikes in Jammu and Kashmir by shooting down an F-16 fighter plane while losing its own MiG-21 jet after which a pilot was “missing in action”. The Pakistani Air Force plane was detected and the alert Indian Air Force responded instantly, foreign ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said, adding in the aerial engagement, one Pakistan Air Force plane was shot down by MiG-21 Bison fighter aircraft of India. “The Pakistani aircraft was seen by the ground forces falling from the sky on the Pakistan side, Kumar said. “In this engagement, we have unfortunately lost one MiG-21. The pilot is missing in action. Pakistan has claimed that he is in their custody. We are ascertaining the facts,” he said. (ANI)
Three-story building collapses in Lagos, Nigeria, and rescuers rush to pull out scores of children thought to be inside | myMotherLode.com  [SEP]  LAGOS, Nigeria — Three-story building collapses in Lagos, Nigeria, and rescuers rush to pull out scores of children thought to be inside.
FEMA Administrator Brock Long Says He Will Step Down  [SEP]  Brock Long, who led the Federal Emergency Management Agency during 220 declared disasters since 2017, announced his resignation Wednesday. In a statement, Long, 43, said “While this has been the opportunity of the lifetime, it is time for me to go home to my family — my beautiful wife and two incredible boys.” William “Brock” Long has led FEMA since June 2017. A former state emergency management director in Alabama, Long was faced with immediate challenges in the federal post, including hurricanes Harvey in Texas and Maria in Puerto Rico. FEMA’s response to Maria was widely criticized as slow and inadequate. Long was also found by the Department Of Homeland Security’s inspector general to have improperly used government vehicles and resources to travel back to his North Carolina home. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said of Long in a statement, “I appreciate his tireless dedication to FEMA and his commitment to fostering a culture of preparedness across the nation.” Nielsen said Deputy Administrator Pete Gaynor will become acting FEMA administrator upon Long’s departure. It’s not clear how much longer Long will remain at his position.
How frigid polar vortex blasts are connected to global warming  [SEP]  How frigid polar vortex blasts are connected to global warming (THE CONVERSATION) A record-breaking cold wave is sending literal shivers down the spines of millions of Americans. Temperatures across the upper Midwest are forecast to fall an astonishing 50 degrees Fahrenheit (28 degrees Celsius) below normal this week – as low as 35 degrees below zero. Pile a gusty wind on top, and the air will feel like -60 F. This cold is nothing to sneeze at. The National Weather Service is warning of brutal, life-threatening conditions. Frostbite will strike fast on any exposed skin. At the same time, the North Pole is facing a heat wave with temperatures approaching the freezing point – about 25 degrees Fahrenheit (14 C) above normal. What is causing this topsy-turvy pattern? You guessed it: the polar vortex. In the past several years, thanks to previous cold waves, the polar vortex has become entrenched in our everyday vocabulary and served as a butt of jokes for late-night TV hosts and politicians. But what is it really? Is it escaping from its usual Arctic haunts more often? And a question that looms large in my work: How does global warming fit into the story? Actually, there are two polar vortices in the Northern Hemisphere, stacked on top of each other. The lower one is usually and more accurately called the jet stream. It’s a meandering river of strong westerly winds around the Northern Hemisphere, about seven miles above Earth’s surface, near the height where jets fly. The jet stream exists all year, and is responsible for creating and steering the high- and low-pressure systems that bring us our day-to-day weather: storms and blue skies, warm and cold spells. Way above the jet stream, around 30 miles above the Earth, is the stratospheric polar vortex. This river of wind also rings the North Pole, but only forms during winter, and is usually fairly circular. Both of these wind features exist because of the large temperature difference between the cold Arctic and warmer areas farther south, known as the mid-latitudes. Uneven heating creates pressure differences, and air flows from high-pressure to low-pressure areas, creating winds. The spinning Earth then turns winds to the right in the northern hemisphere, creating these belts of westerlies. Greenhouse gas emissions from human activities have warmed the globe by about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 C) over the past 50 years. However, the Arctic has warmed more than twice as much. Amplified Arctic warming is due mainly to dramatic melting of ice and snow in recent decades, which exposes darker ocean and land surfaces that absorb a lot more of the sun’s heat. Because of rapid Arctic warming, the north/south temperature difference has diminished. This reduces pressure differences between the Arctic and mid-latitudes, weakening jet stream winds. And just as slow-moving rivers typically take a winding route, a slower-flowing jet stream tends to meander. Large north/south undulations in the jet stream generate wave energy in the atmosphere. If they are wavy and persistent enough, the energy can travel upward and disrupt the stratospheric polar vortex. Sometimes this upper vortex becomes so distorted that it splits into two or more swirling eddies. These “daughter” vortices tend to wander southward, bringing their very cold air with them and leaving behind a warmer-than-normal Arctic. One of these eddies will sit over North America this week, delivering bone-chilling temperatures to much of the nation. Splits in the stratospheric polar vortex do happen naturally, but should we expect to see them more often thanks to climate change and rapid Arctic warming? It is possible that these cold intrusions could become a more regular winter story. This is a hot research topic and is by no means settled, but a handful of studies offer compelling evidence that the stratospheric polar vortex is changing, and that this trend can explain bouts of unusually cold winter weather. Undoubtedly this new polar vortex attack will unleash fresh claims that global warming is a hoax. But this ridiculous notion can be quickly dispelled with a look at predicted temperature departures around the globe for early this week. The lobe of cold air over North America is far outweighed by areas elsewhere in the United States and worldwide that are warmer than normal. Symptoms of a changing climate are not always obvious or easy to understand, but their causes and future behaviors are increasingly coming into focus. And it’s clear that at times, coping with global warming means arming ourselves with extra scarfs, mittens and long underwear.

‘Avengers: Endgame’ obliterates records with $1.2B opening  [SEP]  NEW YORK (AP) — The universe belongs to Marvel. “Avengers: Endgame” shattered the record for biggest opening weekend with an estimated $350 million in ticket sales domestically and $1.2 billion globally, reaching a new pinnacle in the blockbuster era that the comic-book studio has come to dominate. The “Avengers” finale far exceeded even its own gargantuan expectations, according to studio estimates Sunday. The movie had been forecast to open between $260 million and $300 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters, but moviegoers turned out in such droves that “Endgame” blew past the previous record of $257.7 million, set last year by “Avengers: Infinity War” when it narrowly surpassed “The Force Awakens.” “Endgame” was just as enormous overseas. Worldwide, it obliterated the previous record of $640.5 million, also set by “Infinity War.” (“Infinity War” didn’t open in China, the world’s second largest movie market, until two weeks after its debut.) “Endgame” set a new weekend record in China, too, where it made $330.5 million. In one fell swoop, “Endgame” has already made more than movies like “Skyfall,” ”Aquaman” and “The Dark Knight Rises” grossed in their entire runs, not accounting for inflation. Alan Horn, Disney chairman, credited Marvel Studios and its president, Kevin Feige, for challenging “notions of what is possible at the movie theater.” “This weekend’s monumental success is a testament to the world they’ve envisioned, the talent involved, and their collective passion, matched by the irrepressible enthusiasm of fans around the world,” Horn said in a statement. To accommodate demand, the Walt Disney Co. released “Endgame” in more theaters — 4,662 in the U.S. and Canada — than any opening before. Advance ticketing services set new records. Early ticket buyers crashed AMC’s website. And starting Thursday, some theaters even stayed open 72 hours straight. “We’ve got some really tired staff,” said John Fithian, president and chief executive of the National Association of Theater Owners. “I talked to an exhibitor in Kansas who said, ‘I’ve never sold out a 7 a.m. show on Saturday morning before,’ and they were doing it all across their circuit.” Not working in the film’s favor was its lengthy running time: 161 minutes. But theaters dedicated more screens to “Endgame” than any movie before it to satiate the frenzy around Joe and Anthony Russo’s film, one which ties together the “Avengers” storyline as well as the previous 21 releases of the Marvel “cinematic universe” begun with 2008’s “Iron Man.” For an industry dogged by uncertainty over the growing role of streaming, the weekend was a mammoth display of the movie theater’s lucrative potency. Fithian called it possibly “the most significant moment in the modern history of the movie business.” “We’re looking at more than 30 million American and more than 100 million global guests that experienced ‘Endgame’ on the big screen in one weekend,” Fithian said. “The numbers are just staggering.” Further boosting the results for “Endgame” were good reviews; it currently ranks as 96% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, the best rating for any Marvel movie aside from “Black Panther.” If there was any shadow to the weekend for the theatrical business, it was in just how reliant theaters have grown on one studio: Disney. Disney now holds all but one of the top 12 box-office openings of all time. (Universal’s “Jurassic World” is the lone exception.) The studio is poised for a record-breaking year, with releases including “Aladdin,” ”Toy Story 2,” ”The Lion King,” ”Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” and “Frozen 2” on the horizon. Following its acquisition of 20th Century Fox, Disney is expected to account for at least 40% of domestic box-office revenue in 2019, a new record of market share. The company’s “Captain Marvel” — positioned as a kind of Marvel lead-in to “Endgame” — also rose to No. 2 on the weekend, eight weeks after it opened. But theater owners regularly speak of a “halo effect” around a movie like “Endgame.” Such sensations draw in new moviegoers and expose millions to a barrage of movie trailers. An enormous hit was much needed for a box office that, coming into the weekend, was lagging 16% of the pace of last year’s ticket sales, according to Comscore. “Endgame” moved the needle a little, but the boost was less since “Infinity War” opened on the same weekend in 2018. No other new wide release dared to open against “Endgame.” The guessing game will now shift to just how much higher “Endgame” can go. Given its start, it’s likely to rival the top three worldwide grossers: “The Force Awakens” ($2.068 billion in 2015), “Titanic ($2.187 billion in 1997) and “Avatar” ($2.788 in 2009).
In video message, IS chief emulates other hunted leaders  [SEP]  In video message, IS chief emulates other hunted leaders They make threats from their hideaway lairs and celebrate mass attacks. The ending isn't scripted for these hunted men with horrifying death tolls on their hands. When the reclusive Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi appeared in a video Monday, he was the latest in a series of most-wanted figures to use the medium to communicate with the outside world. Al-Baghdadi's goal was to dismiss suggestions of the extremist group's defeat and his own often-reported demise, claim responsibility for the recent Sri Lanka bombings on Easter and warn of a "long battle" ahead. In the video, released by an IS-run media outlet, al-Baghdadi — like others before him, such as Osama bin Laden — wanted to show he's alive and assure followers that the battle against "infidel enemies" continues. "Audio and video messages by hunted figures is their way of rallying and reassuring followers that the group must carry on," said Colin P. Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center. "In some cases, these messages could be intended to motivate supporters to launch attacks, either as individuals or in small groups." With a bounty on their heads, the fugitives record their videos clandestinely. Props are important. Al-Baghdadi in his latest video mirrored a picture of bin Laden — sitting cross-legged with an assault rifle kept against the wall next to him. Here's a look at some infamous and in some cases, chilling video and audio communications from terror leaders to a deposed president on the run: One of the most notorious figures in modern history, the al-Qaida chief bin Laden orchestrated various assaults building up to the September 11 attacks. Shortly after U.S. and NATO forces attacked Afghanistan in October 2001, a video statement emerged of him saying Allah had hit America at its "most vulnerable point ... destroying its most prestigious buildings." Two months later, Washington released an explosive video which featured bin Laden speaking with associates in Afghanistan discussing the 9/11 attacks in more detail. Speaking of the bombers, bin Laden says: "We did not reveal the operation to them until they are there and just before they boarded the planes." "Bin Laden really perfected the use of audio and video tapes," Clarke said. "When a new bin Laden tape was released, everyone stopped what they were doing to listen and see what the world's most wanted man had to say." After he was killed in a U.S. Navy SEAL raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in 2011, another video of bin Laden emerged. He cut an isolated figure as his group became divided and directionless, watching cable news and railing against his enemies. Years later, his son Hamza bin Laden now finds himself squarely in the crosshairs of world powers. He has been featured in about a dozen al-Qaida messages, delivering speeches on everything from the war in Syria to President Donald Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia. His style, heavy on poetry and religious symbolism, mirrors his father's. The current al-Qaida leader and bin Laden's successor has had far less of a global presence and has released few audio or video statements, in which he mostly appears in his trademark white robe and turban. Al-Qaida was in many ways supplanted in recent years by al-Baghdadi's Islamic State group and its brutal march through Iraq and Syria. IS held large swaths of territory — something al-Qaida never managed to do. There was also displeasure from al-Zawahri over IS's frequent targeting of Muslims. Al-Zarqawi led the precursor to the Islamic State group, Al-Qaida in Iraq, as the insurgency against the U.S. occupation raged there after the 2003 invasion. He claimed various attacks against the U.S.-led coalition and his group released gruesome videos showing the beheading of Americans and Britons. A video posted to the internet just months before his death showed him striding in the desert, calling on Sunnis to fight against U.S. forces. He was killed by an American airstrike in Baqouba, Iraq, in 2006. The Iraqi leader and his sons split up and fled Baghdad as U.S. forces closed in on them in the spring of 2003. Saddam released a series of short audio statements while on the run, extolling the Iraqi resistance and urging his countrymen to battle. In his waning days, Saddam resorted to increasingly religious rhetoric to whip up support. In one audio statement, he noted the loss of his sons, Uday and Qusay, killed in the city of Mosul that summer, praising their brave martyrdom for Iraq. He was caught later that year, in December, and the world saw a video of a disheveled once all-powerful dictator who had been hiding in a hole in the ground near his birthplace village. His subsequent trial and execution were broadcast around the globe. Associated Press writer Zeina Karam in Beirut contributed to this report.
U.K. defense secretary fired over Huawei leaks  [SEP]  British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson was summarily fired Wednesday after an investigation into leaks from a secret government meeting about Chinese telecoms firm Huawei. In a letter to Williamson, Prime Minister Theresa May said she “can no longer have full confidence” in Williamson in the wake of the investigation. In the letter released by Downing St., May told Williamson that there was “compelling evidence” suggesting his “responsibility for the unauthorized disclosure” from the National Security Council. “No other, credible version of events to explain this leak has been identified,” she said. There was no immediate comment from Williamson. Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, has been appointed as Williamson’s replacement. An investigation was launched last week after newspapers reported that the security council, which meets in private, had agreed to let Huawei participate in some aspects of Britain’s new 5G wireless communications network. The government insists no decision has been made about Huawei. The United States has been lobbying allies to exclude Huawei from all 5G networks, noting that the Chinese government can force the company to give it backdoor access to data on its networks. The security council includes senior ministers, who receive briefings from top military and intelligence officials, and its meetings are considered highly sensitive. The leak comes amid a Brexit-fueled breakdown in government discipline. With May weakened by her failure to take Britain out of the European Union, multiple ministers are positioning themselves to try to replace her, partly by cultivating positive press coverage. The Daily Telegraph said last week it had obtained details of security council meetings about Huawei. It said several ministers, including Williamson, had opposed letting Huawei work on Britain’s 5G network.
South Korea, US diplomats discuss preparations for 2nd Kim-Trump summit  [SEP]  South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung- and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have discussed coordination between countries to ensure of the upcoming second summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump in Hanoi, the South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Friday. "Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha met with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Warsaw, the Republic of Poland, on February 14 (local time), and discussed ways the Republic of Korea and the United States can work together to make a success of the second US-North Korea summit to be held in two weeks," the statement said. The ministry also stressed that the parties exchanged views on the recent progress regarding the Trump-Kim summit, including US Special Representative for North Korea Stephen Biegun's visit to North Korea. Trump announced on Twitter last Friday that the meeting would take place in the Vietnamese capital on February 27-28. He said he looked forward to meeting Kim to advance "the cause of peace" as they sit down to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Biegun and his North Korean counterpart Kim Hyok Chol held talks in Pyongyang on February 6-8 to prepare the grounds for the second Trump-Kim summit. Trump and Kim met for the first time last June. During the summit, Kim expressed commitment to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula, while Trump said Washington was ready to give security guarantees to Pyongyang.
Mozambique cholera cases now above 1,400; vaccines arrive  [SEP]  BEIRA, Mozambique — Cholera cases in cyclone-hit Mozambique have risen above 1,400, government officials said Tuesday, as hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses arrived in an attempt to limit the rapid spread of the disease. Authorities announced a second death from cholera, which causes acute diarrhea and is spread by contaminated food and water — conditions that some 128,000 displaced cyclone survivors now risk daily while living in temporary, often crowded, shelters. Cholera can kill within hours if not treated. The cholera outbreak has grown swiftly since it was declared last week with five confirmed cases. Now there are 1,428, most of them in the hard-hit port city of Beira, which has been the hub of relief efforts since Cyclone Idai roared in on March 14. The city of a half-million residents is most at risk from cholera but the disease also is reported in outlying communities in central Mozambique. The new death was in Dondo, government officials said. Monday's count of cholera cases had been 1,052. That figure was already more than double the 500 beds that are now open in seven cholera treatment centres across the region, though the World Health Organization said it plans to "boost the capacity significantly." Authorities on Tuesday also said the overall death toll in Mozambique from the cyclone had risen to 598. The number has been called very preliminary and the real toll may never be known, with some people quickly buried or washed away. Some 900,000 oral cholera vaccines arrived in Beira for the expected launch of a vaccination campaign on Wednesday. "The next few weeks are crucial and speed is of the essence if we are to save lives and limit suffering," WHO's regional director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti, said in a statement. Cyclone Idai also killed at least 259 people in neighbouring Zimbabwe and at least 56 in Malawi.
World's largest bee rediscovered in Indonesia – video  [SEP]  Once feared extinct, Wallace’s giant bee has been seen again in the North Moluccas. As long as an adult thumb, it has jaws like a stag beetle and is four times larger than a honeybee. A search team of North American and Australian biologists found the single female giant bee (Megachile pluto) living inside a termites' nest in a tree, more than two metres off the ground
Pope: Vatican next year to open archives on wartime Pius XII  [SEP]  Pope: Vatican next year to open archives on wartime Pius XII VATICAN CITY (AP) — Declaring that the church "isn't afraid of history," Pope Francis said Monday he has decided to open up the Vatican archives on World War II-era Pope Pius XII, who has been criticized by Jews of staying silent on the Holocaust. Francis told officials and personnel of the Vatican Secret Archives that the archive would be open to researchers starting March 2, 2020. Pius was elected pontiff on March 2, 1939, six months before World War II erupted in Europe. Pius died on Oct. 9, 1958, at the Vatican summer residence at Castel Gandolfo, near Rome. The Vatican usually waits 70 years after the end of a pontificate to open up the relevant archives. But the Holy See has been under pressure to make the Pius XII documentation available sooner and while Holocaust survivors are still alive. Vatican archivists had already started preparing the documentation for consultation back in 2006, at the behest of Francis' German-born predecessor, Benedict XVI. The Vatican has defended Pius, saying he used behind-the-scenes diplomacy to try to save lives. Francis indicated he, too, embraced that interpretation. Pius' actions will be scrutinized as part of efforts underway to decide if he should be declared a saint. Francis indicated that the church was confident that the papacy would withstand the findings by historians' studying the archives, saying Pius was "criticized, one can say, with some prejudice and exaggeration." In Jerusalem, the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial commended the decision and expressed the expectation that "researchers will be granted full access to all the documents stored in the archives." It noted that it had for years called for the opening of the archives, saying that will "enable objective and open research as well as comprehensive discourse on issues related to the conduct of the Vatican in particular, and the Catholic church in general, during the Holocaust." Israel's foreign ministry also expressed hopes that there would be "free access to all relevant archives." Francis expressed confidence it was the right move. "The church isn't afraid of history, on the contrary, it loves it, and would like to love it even more, like it loves God," Francis told staff at the archive. "Thus, with the same trust of my predecessors, I open, and entrust to researchers, this patrimony of documentation." Francis expressed certainty that historical research would properly evaluate Pius' legacy "with appropriate criticism." He said the Pius papacy included "moments of grave difficulties, tormented decisions of human and Christian prudence, that to some could appear as reticence." Instead, he said they could be seen as attempts "to keep lit, in the darkest and cruelest periods, the flame of humanitarian initiatives, of hidden but active diplomacy" aimed at possibly "opening hearts." Monday's announcement followed decades of lobbying by Jewish advocates for access to the documentation to help answer the long-standing question of whether Pius did all he could to save lives during World War II. In New York, Rabbi Rosen, the international director for interreligious affairs at the American Jewish Committee called Francis' decision "enormously important to Catholic-Jewish relations." He noted in a statement that he had raised the issue with Francis and his predecessors in meetings. "It is particularly important that experts from the leading Holocaust memorial institutes in Israel and the United States objectively evaluate as best as possible the historical record of that most terrible of times — to acknowledge both the failures as well as the valiant efforts made during the period of the systematic murder of six million Jews," Rosen said. Later this week, it said a delegation of the Committee's leadership will be given an audience with the pope at the Vatican. The organization has lobbied for more than 30 years for full access to the archives. Frances D'Emilio is on twitter at a href='http://www.twitter'www.twitter/a.com/fdemilio
SNAP benefits to be issued March 1  [SEP]  March Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits will be issued early to Illinois customers, according to the Illinois Department of Human Services. March benefits will be loaded into customers’ accounts on March 1. “Our communities shouldn’t have to suffer because of the federal shutdown, and we’ll continue to do all we can at the state level so that Illinoisans don’t see a disruption in their SNAP benefits,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said. “Our plan will reduce the waiting time for benefits for SNAP recipients so our vulnerable residents won’t have to worry about whether the shutdown will prevent them from accessing these services.” SNAP is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and distributed through IDHS in Illinois. Because of the way the USDA funded SNAP during the federal shutdown, February benefits were issued in January. These benefits are typically issued in February and intended for use in February. To reduce the time in between February and March SNAP issuances, IDHS created a new SNAP issuance schedule for March and April. IDHS will be issuing all March benefits on March 1. Customers typically receive their SNAP benefits at different times during the month, so this will be on schedule for some SNAP customers and early for others. IDHS plans to issue April benefits between April 1 and April 10. May benefits will be on the regular schedule. March SNAP benefits were funded through a recent federal stopgap budget. However, April and May SNAP benefits will depend on a new federal budget deal being reached. There is no need for customers to visit local IDHS offices or call their caseworkers. IDHS staff will be working in the upcoming days to implement the necessary changes to issue benefits early. SNAP customers will receive the normal amount of monthly SNAP benefits on their Link cards, the debit-like cards used to spend SNAP benefits and other cash assistance. IDHS will be working to communicate the new issuance dates to SNAP customers in the upcoming weeks through the IDHS website, Link website and phone line, a social media campaign and community outreach.
Toll from Niger tanker truck blast rises to 60: authorities  [SEP]  NIAMEY, Niger - The death toll from a tanker truck explosion near the international airport in Niger's capital, Niamey, has risen to 60, authorities said on Tuesday. The tally is likely to rise further as the prognosis is poor for several people who sustained severe burns, security official Hamani Adamou Abdoul-Aziz told state television. The overturned tanker exploded on Sunday night as crowds gathered to collect spilt fuel. Interior Minister Mohamed Bazoum, who inspected the site on Monday, said people on foot and motorcycle had rushed to the scene to take fuel. According to witnesses, one biker failed to switch off his engine, causing a spark that ignited the 50,000 litres of fuel. The driver of the tanker truck has told investigators that an electrical failure caused him to lose control of the vehicle and its brakes. The truck overturned as he tried to bring it to a stop, senior police official Boubacar Rabiou Daddy told a TV station. Before the blast, people ignored police trying to keep them away, and threw stones at firefighters, he added. The massive explosion on the RN1 route near the international airport left the burnt truck's wreckage, motorbikes and debris scattered over the road. About 40 people were reported injured, most of them in a very serious condition in hospital with severe burns.
Mariah Carey shakes off boycott calls for her Saudi concert  [SEP]  DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Mariah Carey, one of the world's most celebrated artists, is performing in Saudi Arabia on Thursday for the first time, but there's a growing chorus of Saudi women calling on her to cancel the concert to show support for detained women's rights activists. Carey is the highest-profile star to perform in the kingdom since it began loosening decades of restrictions on entertainment, music and fun as part of a push by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to overhaul the economy and transform society. But activists say her concert is an attempt by the government to polish its image after the Oct. 2 killing of Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. It's a dilemma that other celebrities could face as they ink multimillion-dollar deals to perform in Saudi Arabia. The kingdom's General Entertainment Authority has promised a roster of major performances and sports exhibitions by the world's biggest names. Carey's publicists told The Associated Press in a statement that when "presented with the offer to perform for an international and mixed gender audience in Saudi Arabia, Mariah accepted the opportunity as a positive step towards the dissolution of gender segregation." "As the first female international artist to perform in Saudi Arabia, Mariah recognizes the cultural significance of this event and will continue to support global efforts towards equality for all," the statement said, adding that Carey looks forward to bringing inspiration and encouragement to all audiences. In December, the kingdom hosted a Formula-E car race in Riyadh, where thousands of young Saudis and hundreds of international visitors partied into the night at concerts by Enrique Iglesias, The Black Eyed Peas and DJ David Guetta. Omaima Al-Najjar, a Saudi woman who fled the kingdom to seek political refuge abroad, said the concerts are a diversion from the Saudi-led war in Yemen against the neighboring country's Houthi rebels, human rights abuses committed under the crown prince and repressive male guardianship laws that restrict women's freedoms. "The Saudi government is using entertainment to distract the people from human rights abuses because it can sense the anger among the public," she said. Al-Najjar is a co-founder of Women for Rights in Saudi Arabia, or WARSA, which launched a petition calling on Carey to boycott the country. The petition aimed to publicly pressure Carey because "she has power to stand for women ... as an artist and as a female," Al-Najjar said. Activists are tweeting at Carey directly, urging her to take notice of the prominent Saudi women's rights activists imprisoned since May who had long campaigned for social changes and women's empowerment. The women, who include activists in their 20s as well as mothers, grandmothers and retired professors, have been accused of vague national security violations in connection to their human rights work. Al-Najjar said artists like Carey should make their performances in Saudi Arabia conditional on the release of the women's rights activists. A boycott would not impact ordinary Saudis because many cannot afford the concert's ticket prices anyway, she said. Tickets for Carey's concert start at around $80, and VIP seats — already sold out — cost $530. The average monthly wage for Saudis is around $2,600, according to the General Authority for Statistics. Alia al-Hathloul called on Mariah Carey to remember her sister, Loujain al-Hathloul, who she says has been abused and threatened with death while in detention because of her activism, which included defying the kingdom's ban on women driving before it was lifted last year. "Remember, thanks to my sister @LoujainHathloul, you r able to perform in Saudi Arabia. I wish she can attend your concert. But she's locked behind bars because she tried to improve women's condition. Don' forget to thank her on stage," she wrote to Carey on Twitter. Saudi female artist Ms Saffaa wrote on Twitter: "Will @MariahCarey be singing 'It's a long road when u face the world alone. No one reaches out a hand 4 u 2 hold' to imprisoned female #Saudi activists @LoujainHathloul, @Saudiwoman, & @azizayousef?" Both women, as well as Al-Najjar, made their pleas from abroad, where they do not face the prospect of arrest for speaking out. Carey is to perform at King Abdullah Economic City, a two-hour drive north of Islam's holiest site of Mecca. The Economic City, built as a sort-of enclave for foreigners and Saudis, is gated and can only be entered with permission from security. The concert, which includes DJ Tiesto, has also drawn the ire of some ultraconservatives on Twitter, angered that it is taking place in the greater region of Mecca. The General Entertainment Authority's online flyer for Carey's concert shows her only from the waist up, with a red scarf draped over her arms. Women in Saudi Arabia are required to wear loose, long black robes known as abayas in public. Most Saudi women also cover their hair and face. Still, a concert like this would have been unthinkable until recently. Religious police used to enforce strict gender segregation, scolded women for not covering their hair and barged into restaurants to demand music be turned off. The changes have a powerful backer in the crown prince, who is seeking to boost domestic spending and draw attention to his reforms. Efforts to brand him a reformer took a hit after Saudi agents close to the crown prince killed and dismembered Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who was critical of the prince's crackdown on dissent. The U.S. Senate and U.S. intelligence have blamed the crown prince for the killing, but Saudi Arabia insists he had no involvement. Thursday night's concert is taking place at the Saudi International golf tournament. The European Tour has drawn several of golf's biggest stars, including four of the top five players in the world. The purse is $3.5 million, though the primary income for these players is appearance money, likely to be in the $1 million range for the biggest names. The golfing champions signed up to play for the European Tour event last April, well before Saudi agents killed Khashoggi. Even so, at least one big-name player pulled back. UNICEF ambassador Paul Casey has also said he'd "sit this one out."

Money laundering case: Deepak Talwar offshore entitites projected as untainted in Indian firm, ED tells Delhi HC  [SEP]  The Enforcement Directorate (ED) Monday told Delhi High Court that about Rs 369 crore “laundered” through consultant Deepak Talwar’s offshore entities are “projected as untainted” in M/s Wave Hospitality Pvt Ltd which is an Indian company and holds Holiday Inn in Aerocity, Delhi. The agency disclosed this in the affidavit filed before the court hearing Talwar’s plea challenging his detention after he was deported from the UAE and arrested in connection with a money laundering case on January 31. Talwar, presently in judicial custody, allegedly facilitated dispersal of profit-making routes of Air India to private airlines using his connection with the then Civil Aviation Minister. In his habeas corpus petition, Talwar claimed his arrest and custody from January 30 onwards was illegal detention for which affirmative orders deserve to be passed to secure his personal life and liberty. Taking note, the court issued a notice to the ED and directed it to file a response. Praying for dismissal of Talwar’s plea on ground of “non-maintainability”, the agency said, “He is facing serious accusation of offence of money laundering and further investigation is ongoing”. It said so long as an individual is in custody in pursunace to a judicial order by the competent court, a writ of habeus corpus is “not maintainable”. “He acted as a middleman in the negotiations of the bilateral memorandum of understandings (MoUs). In lieu of the same, the entities directly or indirectly controlled by him have received the kickbacks after the signing of the MoUs,” the ED’s affidavit said. The affidavit also said Talwar is beneficial owner of offshore entities such as Asiafield Limited where money from Qatar Airway and Air Arabia was received. They said huge amounts of funds were moved from Air Arabia/Qatar Airways to Asiafield Limited, then to Wave Impex Pvt Ltd, and then to Wave Hospitality Pvt Ltd and all these entities were beneficially owned and operated by Deepak Talwar and his family members. “It is pertinent to mention here that the layering and laundering of funds in these entities is continuing till date since the year 2008. Further the funds laundered through entities such as Asiafield Limited, Gilt Asset Management Limited, are projected as untainted in M/s Wave Hospitality Pvt Ltd which is an Indian Company and holds hotel Holiday Inn in Aerocity, Delhi.

Vietnam memorial to North Korea pilots marks bygone alliance  [SEP]  BAC GIANG, Vietnam (AP) — In a rice field in northern Vietnam, 14 headstones are an enduring symbol of the wartime friendship of Vietnam and North Korea. They mark the original burial ground of North Korean pilots who died while secretly fighting alongside Vietnamese comrades against U.S. Air Force and Navy planes during the Vietnam War. The role of North Korea is a footnote in the sweeping history of that conflict, one that speaks mostly of the fraternal relations of two nations that separately fought bruising armed conflicts against the United States in the context of the Cold War. Decades later, the communist nations’ friendship is apparent as Vietnam gets ready to host a summit of the North Korean and U.S. leaders later this month. “When they died, Vietnamese people treated them the same as Vietnamese martyrs who sacrificed for the country,” Duong Van Dau, the caretaker of the memorial said last week. On the high ground where the fallen pilots were interred, their tombs all face northeast, toward their homeland. South Korea’s role in the war is much better known. From 1964 to 1973, Seoul deployed more than 300,000 military personnel to help the U.S. effort in South Vietnam against the communists. By contrast, the North Korean air force contingent deployed near Hanoi in what was then called North Vietnam — the communist half of the war-torn Southeast Asian nation — had 200-400 personnel, including about 90 pilots over more than two years, according to postwar Vietnamese accounts. In September 1966, according to Vietnamese historical documents obtained and translated by CIA analyst-turned-scholar Merle Pribbenow, Hanoi accepted an offer by Pyongyang to send three companies of pilots who would form a regiment equipped with 30 aircraft in total. They were to wear North Vietnamese uniforms and Vietnam would provide the aircraft, facilities and equipment. It was timely assistance. Vietnam’s fleet of aging Russian-made MiG-17 fighters was taking heavy losses defending against the U.S. bombing campaign against North Vietnam, Operation Rolling Thunder. China and Russia provided material assistance, but the number of trained Vietnamese pilots was shrinking by attrition. The first North Korean contingent, also destined to fly Mig-17s, were sent before the end of 1966 to Kep air base in Bac Giang province, 70 kilometers (40 miles) northeast of Hanoi, to aid in training and to carry out combat missions. “The agreement was signed by the two governments, but we didn’t know anything about it. I did know that North Korea wanted to send pilots to Vietnam so that they could practice and gain experience with the aim of building its air force,” Vu Ngoc Dinh, one of the Vietnamese pilots who served alongside the Koreans, recalled in an interview with István Toperczer, a Hungarian air force officer turned historian. “The pilots were their best ones whose parents or relatives were working for the Politburo of the North Korean Central Party Committee,” Dinh is quoted saying in Toperczer’s book, MiG Aces of the Vietnam War. “They sent their pilots and commanders to Vietnam and we provided the hardware they required during their service.” “They kept everything secret, so we didn’t know their loss ratio, but the North Korean pilots claimed 26 American aircraft destroyed,” said Dinh. “Although they fought very bravely in the aerial battles, they were generally too slow and too mechanical in their reactions when engaged, which is why so many of them were shot down by the Americans. They never followed flight instructions and regulations either. “ Dau, the cemetery caretaker, is also a war veteran. He joined the army and marched south in 1966 to fight for the communist side in South Vietnam. He was discharged three years later after getting shot in the knee in fighting just outside of Saigon, now called Ho Chi Minh City. “For the North Korean pilots who fought to protect our country and died for our country, I salute them. Being a soldier myself, I have great compassion for them. I see them as my comrades, regardless of the nationality,” Dau said. In 2002, the remains of the pilots were repatriated from Vietnam to North Korea in a ceremony held by the military of both countries. But the headstones remain, lined up in two rows behind a memorial marker with an inscription in Vietnamese: “Here used to lie 14 North Korean comrades.” Since the repatriation, the number of visitors to the site has declined. But Dau said he would continue to care for the gated memorial to the fallen pilots. Only in 2000-2001 was the participation of the North Korean pilots officially acknowledged by Hanoi and Pyongyang. Since then, there has been a trickle of additional details about North Korea’s involvement in the Vietnam War, teased out mostly from Vietnamese memoirs and state press accounts and Eastern European diplomatic archives. What has also emerged is a revisionist view of North Korea’s assistance, which suggests Pyongyang would have been happy to see Hanoi fight to the last Vietnamese. “Sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire of the Vietnam War, the U.S. government did not want to open a new front in Korea if it could help it,” wrote Balázs Szalontai, a Hungarian historian of North Korea. He alleges that North Korea’s then-leader, Kim Il Sung, “had much to gain from keeping America bogged down in Vietnam” and for that reason went out of it way to sustain North Vietnam’s struggle. Conversely, “the very fact that North Korea’s assistance to Hanoi was strongly motivated by self-interest also implied that Pyongyang would not take kindly to any steps that could potentially enable the U.S. to get off the Indochinese hook and refocus its attention on the Korean peninsula,” he noted in an essay in nknews.org, a website with news and analysis about North Korea. When Washington and Hanoi began peace talks in Paris in 1968, North Korean aid began to tail off sharply, noted Szalontai, Pyongyang greeted the 1973 Paris Peace Accords coldly.

Watch: Spokane astronaut Anne McClain takes part in third ISS spacewalk of 2019  [SEP]  Spokane native and NASA astronaut Anne McClain is participating in her second spacewalk of the year on Monday. McClain and David Saint-Jacques of the Canadian Space Agency are working to upgrade the International Space Station power systems and expand wireless communications coverage for the ISS. The power update will also help supply the space station’s robotic arm. The spacewalk began at about 4:31 a.m. on Monday and is expected to continue for about 6.5 hours. Monday’s spacewalk marks the third in less than a month for the Expedition 59 crew and the second of 2019 for McClain. It is the last spacewalk in a series of three for the crew. On March 22, the first spacewalk of 2019 was completed by McClain and Hague. On March 29, astronauts Nick Hague and Christina Koch set out on the second spacewalk. RELATED: Spokane astronaut Anne McClain takes part in first spacewalk of 2019 For those watching the live stream on Monday, McClain is wearing the spacesuit with red stripes. A spacewalk is the equivalent of running a marathon, according to Hague. He said astronauts wear spacesuits for nearly 12 hours and only have 32 ounces of water. In March, McClain was set to take part in what would have been the first all-female spacewalk. NASA announced that it would not happen due to an assignment change stemming from spacesuit availability. NASA tweeted that they have more than one medium spacesuit torso aboard the International Space Station but needed to change spacewalker assignments rather than reconfigure spacesuits for safety reasons and to stay on schedule with upgrades. On Twitter, McClain said NASA’s decision was based on her recommendation. RELATED: 'The dream's got to die': SNL pokes fun at NASA over Anne McClain's canceled spacewalk RELATED: NASA clarifies why it put all-female spacewalk on hold In early April, McClain, along with fellow astronauts Hague and Christina Koch, appeared on the Today Show.

U.S. Charges Chinese Telecom Giant Huawei, Asks Canada For CFO Extradition  [SEP]  The Justice Department unsealed criminal charges against China's most important telecommunications company on Monday, in a deepening of the ongoing geopolitical chill across the Pacific Ocean. Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said Huawei has been indicted on 13 criminal counts and that he is requesting that Canada extradite its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1 on a U.S. warrant. Meng was released on bail but has not been able to leave Canada given the expectation that Washington might ask to put her on trial. The Wall Street Journal reported last April that the Justice Department was investigating Huawei for potentially violating U.S. sanctions on Iran. Whitaker said that Huawei has been trying to steal American telecommunications technology and also lying about its relationship with its Iranian subsidiary. The Chinese parent company claimed that it had sold its Iranian division, he said, when actually it had kept control and ownership of it. That meant that American banks doing business with Huawei were inadvertently violating American restrictions on economic activity linked to Iran. The Trump administration appears to have decided to make an example of Meng, who is not only a top corporate officer but also the daughter of the founder of Huawei — which is one of China's most important global brands and seen as an arm of its power around the world. The announcement on Monday was the latest example of the Justice Department raising the alarm over what it calls the loss of billions of dollars' worth of American intellectual property to Chinese cybertheft. U.S. and allied intelligence officials also fear that Huawei's technology helps with Chinese government espionage. It has been barred from selling network equipment in countries leery about Beijing's ambitions. "As Americans, we should all be concerned by the potential for any company beholden to a foreign government — especially one that doesn't share our values — to burrow into the American telecommunications market," said FBI Director Christopher Wray. "That kind of access could give a foreign government the capacity to maliciously modify or steal information, conduct undetected espionage, or exert pressure or control." Beijing is expected to condemn the announcement. The Chinese government already has responded to Meng's arrest by taking a number of Canadians into custody and applying pressure on its relationship with Ottawa. So far, the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has held fast, although cracks have begun to appear. Trudeau fired Ottawa's ambassador to China after the envoy mused about the case that Meng might make to keep from being extradited to the United States and about how much better for Canada it might be if the United States dropped its extradition request. Canada's foreign minister said the former ambassador's comments had made it untenable for him to remain in his job, according to Reuters. With sanctions and the threat of more economic restrictions, President Trump has sought to pressure China into accepting broader concessions in the bilateral trading relationship. A delegation from China is expected in Washington as part of the ongoing trade dispute, but White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Monday that the charges announced at the Justice Department are not a negotiation tactic. "It's a totally separate process," she said. Whitaker also was asked about the broader bilateral situation between the United States and China. He said the Department of Justice acts independently of the White House and it had arrived at the need to charge Huawei as the result of its own investigations. Canadian officials also have sought to separate themselves from the U.S.-China tensions, arguing there's no cause for China to detain the Canadians it has taken into custody since Meng's arrest. China's ambassador to Canada shot back earlier this month that Ottawa is guilty of "white supremacy" and of applying a double standard in asking for its citizens to be free while Meng remained unable to travel and subject to extradition to the United States.
Fire in centuries-old part of Bangladesh’s capital kills 70  [SEP]  DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — A devastating fire raced through densely packed buildings in a centuries-old shopping district in Bangladesh’s capital, killing at least 70 people, officials and witnesses said Thursday. The fire in Dhaka’s Chawkbazar area was mostly under control after more than 10 hours of frantic firefighting efforts. Some of the about 50 people injured were critically burned. The district dating to the Mughal era, 400 years ago, is crammed with buildings separated by narrow alleys, with residences commonly above shops, restaurants or warehouses on the ground floors. Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up The blaze started late Wednesday night in one building but quickly spread to others, fire department Director General Brig. Gen. Ali Ahmed said. Many of the victims trapped inside the buildings, said Mahfuz Riben, a control room official of the Fire Service and Civil Defense in Dhaka. “Our teams are working there but many of the recovered bodies are beyond recognition. Our people are using body bags to send them to the hospital morgue, this is a very difficult situation,” he told AP by phone. The fire services director, Maj. AKM Shakil Newaz, said 70 dead have been recovered and were taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Ambulances were arriving carrying bodies, and relatives were mourning in front of the morgue. Most buildings in Chawkbazar are used both for residential and commercial purposes despite warnings of the potential for high fatalities from fires after one had killed at least 123 people in 2010. Authorities had promised to bring the buildings under regulations and remove chemical warehouses from the residential buildings. Such tragedies are shockingly common in Bangladesh, where fires, floods, ferry sinkings and other disasters regularly claim dozens of lives or more. In 2012, a fire raced through a garment factory on the outskirts of Dhaka, killing at least 112 people trapped behind its locked gates. Less than six months later, another building housing garment factories collapsed, killing more than 1,100 people. The death toll from the latest fire could still rise as the condition of some of the injured people was critical, said Samanta Lal Sen, head of a burn unit of the Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Sen said at least nine of the critically injured people were being treated in his unit. Witnesses told local TV stations that many gas cylinders stored in the buildings continued to explode one after another. They said the fire also set off explosions in fuel tanks of some of the vehicles that got stuck in traffic in front of the destroyed buildings. Some reports suggested many of the dead were pedestrians, shoppers or diners who died quickly as several gas cylinders exploded, and the fire engulfed the nearby buildings very quickly. Officials said the firefighters struggled to get close to the scene because of heavy traffic and narrow alleys that were busy when the fire started.
'Never gonna give EU up' - Hundreds of thousands march through London to demand new referendum on Brexit  [SEP]  Hundreds of thousands of people opposed to Britain's withdrawal from the European Union marched through central London on Saturday to demand a new referendum as the deepening Brexit crisis risked sinking Prime Minister Theresa May's premiership. Hundreds of thousands of people opposed to Britain's withdrawal from the European Union marched through central London on Saturday to demand a new referendum as the deepening Brexit crisis risked sinking Prime Minister Theresa May's premiership. 'Never gonna give EU up' - Hundreds of thousands march through London to demand new referendum on Brexit Marchers set off in central London with banners proclaiming "the best deal is no Brexit" and "we demand a People's Vote" in what organisers said could be the biggest anti-Brexit protest yet. After three years of tortuous debate, it is still uncertain how, when or even if Brexit will happen as May tries to plot a way out of the gravest political crisis in at least a generation. May hinted on Friday that she might not bring her twice-defeated EU divorce deal back to parliament next week, leaving her Brexit strategy in meltdown. The Times and The Daily Telegraph reported that pressure was growing on May to resign. "I would feel differently if this was a well managed process and the government was taking sensible decisions. But it is complete chaos," Gareth Rae, 59, who travelled from Bristol to attend the demonstration, told Reuters. "The country will be divided whatever happens and it is worse to be divided on a lie." While the country and its politicians are divided over Brexit, most agree it is the most important strategic decision the United Kingdom has faced since World War II. Pro-EU protesters gathered for a "Put it to the people march" at Marble Arch on the edge of Hyde Park around midday, before marching past the prime minister's office in Downing Street and finish outside parliament. While there was no official estimate of the numbers, campaign organisers said hundreds of thousands of people were in the crowd as it began to march. Organisers were confident that the size of the crowd would exceed a similar rally held in October, when supporters said about 700,000 people turned up. Phoebe Poole, 18, who was holding a placard saying "never gonna give EU up" in reference to a song by 1980s popstar Rick Astley, wasn’t old enough to vote in the 2016 referendum. "We have come here today because we feel like our future has been stolen from us. It is our generation that is going to have to live with the consequences of this disaster," she told Reuters. "It is going to make it harder to get a job. You are already seeing a lot of large companies leaving. I am worried about the future." Two hundred coaches from around Britain were booked to take people to London for the march. One coach left the Scottish Highlands on Friday evening, and another left from Cornwall on England's western tip early on Saturday morning. A petition to cancel Brexit altogether gained 4 million signatures in just 3 days after May told the public "I am on your side" over Brexit and urged lawmakers to get behind her deal. In the June 23, 2016 referendum, 17.4 million voters, or 52pc, backed Brexit while 16.1 million, or 48 percent, backed staying in the bloc. But ever since, opponents of Brexit have been exploring ways to hold another referendum. May has repeatedly ruled out holding another Brexit referendum, saying it would deepen divisions and undermine support for democracy. Brexit supporters say a second referendum would trigger a major constitutional crisis. We already put it to the people. And the people roared," pro-leave group Change Britain said in a tweet. Supporters of Brexit say that while the divorce might bring some short-term instability, in the longer term Britain would thrive if cut free from what they cast as a doomed experiment in German-dominated unity that is falling far behind other major powers. Some opinion polls have shown a slight shift in favour of remaining in the European Union, but there has yet to be a decisive change in attitudes. Many voters in Britain say they have become increasingly bored by Brexit and May said on Wednesday that they want this stage of the Brexit process to be "over and done with." But protesters disagreed with May's claim that she is on the side of the British public, with one placard reading: "You do not speak for us Theresa."
Early results: No party secures majority in Moldova ballot  [SEP]  CHISINAU, Moldova (AP) — Near-final results from Sunday's parliamentary elections in Moldova showed no party secured a majority, a result that could leave the former Soviet republic in limbo between pro-Western and pro-Russia forces. With 97 percent of the votes counted early Monday, the broadly pro-Russia opposition Socialists had 31.5 percent, while the pro-European group ACUM had 25.9 percent. The incumbent Democratic Party was trailing in third place with 24.1 percent. The election comes as the Democratic Party's governing alliance has lost support over rampant corruption, falling living standards and the erosion of democracy in Moldova, a small landlocked nation between Romania and Ukraine. President Igor Dodon forecast another election in the coming months. "We have a major risk of early elections," he said after casting his ballot. An inconclusive outcome could lead to instability, and Dodon and pro-Europe leader Maia Sandu have warned of demonstrations if elections are found to be marred by fraud. If lawmakers fail to form a governing coalition within 45 days of the election result, the president will dissolve the legislature and call a new vote. More than 3 million voters were eligible to choose representatives for the next four years to the 101-seat legislature. Parties needed to win a minimum of 6 percent of the ballots to enter Parliament. Election authorities said voter turnout was just over 49 percent when polls closed. ACUM party leader Maia Sandu told The Associated Press that the election was "the most undemocratic in the history of Moldova." "A gang of thieves ... has captured the state institutions" and are "scaring ... threatening and impoverishing us," Sandu said Sunday as she urged Moldovans to vote. One voter, Svetlana Druta, said she had voted to change the judicial system. "We need to start from the top and then (change) elementary schools and kindergartens, and then we need a good health" system, she said. Last year, the European Parliament called Moldova "a state captured by oligarchic interests." The European Union also froze aid to Moldova after a local court invalidated the 2018 Chisinau mayoral election on a technicality, a move to thwart the apparent victory of a pro-Europe candidate. But Vladimir Plahotniuc, the Democratic Party chief and the country's de facto leader, insisted Sunday that the ruling party had brought "order and discipline" through its economic policies. Despite that claim, an estimated 1 million Moldovans have moved abroad to find jobs, mainly in the EU and Russia. Moldova's voting system has been changed in what critics say is a ploy to help the two main parties — the Socialists and the Democrats — carve up influence. About 340 international observers from 38 countries monitored the ballot. Associated Press writers Alison Mutler in Bucharest, Romania, and Corneliu Rusnac in Chisinau, Moldova, contributed to this report.
Hungarian party faces discipline from center-right EU bloc  [SEP]  BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — A senior lawmaker from Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel's party says Hungary's ruling Fidesz party may be suspended from the main center-right bloc in the European Parliament. Prime Minister Viktor Orban's authoritarian style and anti-European Union, anti-migration policies have long put him at odds with many members of the European People's Party, whose delegates are meeting Wednesday to debate possible disciplinary measures against Fidesz. Inge Graessle, an EU parliament lawmaker from Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, told Germany's SWR2 radio that she believes the EPP will "temporarily suspend his membership today — that is the step before expulsion — and then he can choose how he wants to continue." Graessle said Orban, who had led Fidesz practically unchallenged since the early 1990s, "has to show credibly that he will change."
Snooki Wants The Donald…Trump That Is, To Run For Prez  [SEP]  Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi expressed her dissatisfaction of the 2012 presidential candidates at the launch of her Team Snooki Boxing press conference. Snooki chatted with Jo Piazza of the Huffington Post saying she would vote for ‘The Donald,’ “I thought Trump was gonna run … But he’s not, right? I would endorse him and vote for him.” Celebrities have a knack for getting involved in politics and possibly swaying voter decisions, does Snooki have that kind of influence?

US-Taliban talks: Is Afghanistan ready for real peace?  [SEP]  For Abdul Hamid Wardak, whose uncle and brother-in-law were executed by the Taliban, even a glimmer of peace brings some level of hope. “When I heard that peace is coming, I was very happy,” he says. “I felt good for the whole country.” “The new situation we are facing is a combination of optimism and fear,” says Orzala Nemat, director of a think tank in Kabul. “The optimism comes from the fact that there seems to be a serious opportunity to end the bloodshed,” she says. “The fear that I have is: What will this new peace look like? Is it taking us back to the Stone Age?” A series of contacts between US officials and the Taliban have raised hopes for peace in Afghanistan. Yet concerns abound. Even as the Taliban mount a charm offensive, they refuse to speak to the Afghan government and identify as representatives of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, which ceased to exist in 2001. For many Afghans who have seen advances in women’s rights and other gains in civil society, the question remains: How much have the Taliban changed? With the United States eyeing a withdrawal from America’s longest war, a fledgling peace process in Afghanistan involving direct talks between the US and Taliban insurgents has created the most optimism in years. But serious concerns abound, not least due to reports the Taliban are preparing for a new fighting season even as they negotiate. The colossal challenges yet to come in bringing the Islamist Taliban and Afghan government to a peace agreement are encapsulated in a story surrounding a single “hanging” tree in Wardak Province, southwest of Kabul. It was from that tree that the Taliban, three years ago, hung the body of Rahmatullah, an off-duty army officer and father of seven, after kidnapping, starving, and torturing him for two weeks. Attached to the tree they left a small note of explanation: “Anybody working with the government, this is the result.” “It is not only our family that has made sacrifices; every family in Afghanistan has losses like this,” says Rahmatullah’s brother-in-law, Abdul Hamid Wardak, a quiet 26-year-old who was shocked to see the state of his relative’s body. Months later Mr. Wardak’s uncle also was murdered, accused of being a government spy and shot dead by Taliban gunmen. Wardak had to move away and today runs a vegetable shop in Kabul. “That’s clear, how bad the Taliban are,” says Wardak. He says he can’t forgive the Taliban for the killings that have devastated his family, but he sees a higher aim in a peace that could end the bloodshed – a trade-off that will have to be embraced by many Afghans if a peace deal is to prevent future slaughter. “When I heard that peace is coming, I was very happy. I felt good for the whole country,” says Wardak. “Conflict and war are not only in my province; they are all over Afghanistan.... We urgently need peace.” That peace is not imminent, and the “most optimism in years” is a low bar. But analysts say factors are lining up in ways they have not before: President Trump has expressed a determination to withdraw the 14,000 US troops from Afghanistan, and while the Taliban have made battlefield gains for years, few analysts expect that outright military victory over the government – backed for now by US and NATO forces – is possible. Signs of progress are plentiful: Taliban negotiators have met several times with US officials in recent months and agreed in principle to a framework that would exchange a US troop withdrawal for the Taliban ensuring that Afghan soil is never again used to mount terrorist attacks abroad. There is a sense of urgency engendered by Zalmay Khalilzad, the US special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, who said a week ago there was “a lot of work” still to be done but that he hoped a deal could be finalized before July, when Afghanistan is due to hold presidential elections. Mr. Khalilzad will next meet the Taliban Feb. 25 in Doha, Qatar. The Taliban, however, refuse to speak to the Afghan government, which they call a puppet of the US. And so far the government is not part of the US-led process, nor was it invited earlier this month to Moscow, where the Taliban met other Afghan politicians, including former President Hamid Karzai. US officials increasingly speak of the need to bring all Afghan parties together. President Ashraf Ghani nevertheless called Monday for a national loya jirga, or consultative assembly, by the end of March. “We have to determine those values which should not be compromised,” said Mr. Ghani, who recently stated that 45,000 Afghan security force members have died since he took office in 2014. “The scale of flexibility and the cost of peace must be clarified.” Yet there is no agreement on how the Taliban might be integrated into current state structures – which the Taliban have fought for years, with widespread assassination and intimidation campaigns – or even if the Constitution might be changed. And crucially, for many Afghans who, since the US toppled the Taliban in 2001, have seen advances in women’s rights and education, the rule of law, a free press, and other gains in civil society, the question remains: How much have the Taliban changed? During Taliban rule, Afghan women were not allowed to work. Nor were they allowed to leave their home without wearing an all-enveloping burqa. Girls were forbidden from going to school. “The new situation we are facing is a combination of optimism and fear,” says Orzala Nemat, director of the Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit (AREU), a think tank in Kabul. “The optimism comes from the fact that there seems to be a serious opportunity to end the bloodshed, to end the killing of Afghans, [because] I see the graveyards getting larger across the country,” she says. “The fear that I have is: What will this new peace look like? Is it taking us back to the Stone Age?” Aside from stopping the fighting, Ms. Nemat says, peace “also means that, when I am engaging in my public life, I will not feel threatened by anyone. So that’s the other side, and women take that very seriously.” Taliban delegates to the talks present themselves in public as members of a wiser, media-friendly organization that has learned from mistakes in the past. Analysts note in recent years that, despite the violence, the Taliban have often shown increased flexibility to accommodate local wishes in areas under their control. And yet the Taliban also publicly downplay the scale of civilian casualties, suggest vaguely that women’s rights will be beholden to Islamic law – their interpretation of it – and speak in the name of their former regime, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, which ceased to exist in 2001. The result, says Thomas Ruttig, co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts Network in Kabul, is that much more needs to be done. “Let’s not expect that all the mess of 40 years of conflicts in Afghanistan can be cleaned out in six months, because in the last 17 years there was progress here and there, but also new problems,” he says. “We are at the very beginning of a very long way, and it is not a smooth path,” says Mr. Ruttig. “There is potential conflict about every meter of that way, because it is about rights, about what a future state should look like.” To maximize their leverage, the Taliban appear to be on a diplomatic charm offensive. “We know that ... taking the whole country by [force] will not help, because it will not bring peace in Afghanistan,” Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, the Taliban political chief, told the BBC in Moscow. “We wanted to solve these things on the table, in a peaceful manner,” said Mr. Stanikzai. “So after the withdrawal of foreign forces, there should be no fighting among Afghans. There should be peace forever.” Stanikzai said that after the withdrawal of US forces, “we want to be friends with you in the future. So the Americans should come back to Afghanistan and work with us in rehabilitation and reconstruction.” But those optics are misleading, says Nader Nadery, a senior adviser to the Afghan president. “America’s efforts for peace are very much welcomed, but we need to be mindful that, if we rush things, that will send the wrong signal to the Pakistanis and the Taliban,” he says, referring to Pakistan’s long-term, deep support for the Taliban. “That sense of urgency we understand; we Afghans have that sense of urgency. But rushing it through is making the Taliban more arrogant, to feel that they have the upper hand and feel that the US is desperate,” says Mr. Nadery. “The outcome will not give the Afghan people and the Americans what they want: a stable country that will build on the gains that have been made in the last 17 years, at the cost of blood and treasure.” How far the Taliban’s diplomatic rhetoric affects the battlefield is hard to gauge, since it comes after a stepped-up American bombing campaign that has killed more than 30 Taliban commanders since December, according to Western and Afghan sources. In fact, the peace effort comes after US airstrikes hit a decade high in Afghanistan, with 7,362 weapons released in 2018 – more than the previous three years combined – according to the US Central Command. At the same time, the Taliban have been preparing through the winter for a new season of fighting as if peace were not an option, says an Afghan intelligence officer of the National Directorate of Security, who asked not to be named. Replacement commanders installed by the Taliban have been among the most hardened. “I am on the front line; I am collecting information from everywhere,” says the intelligence officer. “Every day we see [Taliban] restructuring, and new responsible people coming from Pakistan. They are distributing weapons, preparing suicide attackers, preparing car bombs.” “If such a thing [peace] will be their next plan, why are they working on their new war strategy for the next year?” he asks. “There is also a difference between the Taliban. Some of them want peace and accept the voice of the leadership. And some of them don’t know who they are or what they are doing. They only need to be at war. Their lifestyle is like this.” And the Taliban have another problem as they try to reenter politics. When they first took control in 1996, they were welcomed by many, despite their strict Islamist rules, for ending years of brutal fighting between mujahideen warlords. “The Taliban today have a much harder time to convince people that they are not going to deceive Afghans by saying, ‘Oh, we are the peace-bringers in this country,’ ” says Nemat of the AREU think tank. “Because [they have] the fresh blood [on their hands] of young journalists being killed, young teachers, young students, young girls and boys, and even the elderly, with no reason.”
Protests expected as Venezuelan blackout continues  [SEP]  March 12 (UPI) -- Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said schools and businesses will be closed Tuesday and Wednesday because energy officials are still struggling with a blackout that has paralyzed the nation since last Thursday. "I expect that between tonight and tomorrow we will have a more stable result," Maduro said during a televised speech, El Nacional newspaper reported Tuesday. Maduro made the comments as the few areas in Venezuela with electricity are receiving, at best, intermittent service. Public transportation was brought to a halt and the population is picking up water in containers from unsafe sources, as the power failure has cut off access to safe water from pumps. National Assembly leader and self-declared interim leader Juan Guaido called for protests Tuesday afternoon to put pressure on the government to solve the energy crisis, which has affected hospitals by interrupting some vital services, such as dialysis. "I call for Venezuelans to go and protest to their closest avenues and streets. The end of the usurpation depends on our massive and organized mobilization," Guaido said. There have been at least five incidents of attempted looting, with at least 50 arrests reported. Guaido said Monday that looting is a consequence of the government preventing a solution by not making a transition of power possible. The National Assembly has declared Maduro's presidency illegal and vacant, and wants him to step down. "Without light, water, and food the despair can drive our people to a state on the edge to obtain nourishment for their own," Guaido said in an El Nacional report. Venezuelan State Attorney Tarek William has said that Guaido's comments appear to be inciting crimes against property, adding that he would be investigated for participating in alleged sabotage. Maduro's government has claimed that the cause of the blackout is a cyberattack launched from the United States, as well as attacks on electric substations. However, Guaido has blamed the Maduro's government's inefficiency for the blackout. Maduro said Tuesday that his country's efforts to try to recover electricity are affected by "high frequency electromagnetic" interference that is interrupting the efforts to normalize electricity, according to an audio of his speech in Telesur, a television channel financed by Caracas. He said he ordered flights over the country and other actions to neutralize the alleged cyber and electromagnetic attacks as of Tuesday morning. According to a report in El Tiempo, experts in the Venezuelan electricity system said it could not have been target of a cyberattack because it is an analog system and is not digital. The power failures are more likely the consequence of poor maintenance, experts said. Maduro said that the opposition is taking advantage of the blackout to seek a coup. Maduro has in recent years blamed the country's ills on the United States. Venezuela is going through an economic and political crisis that has led some 3 million to flee the country in recent years. The country suffers from hyperinflation and political violence has taken the country's homicide rate soaring to the highest level in all of Latin America starting in 2018.
42,000 Coast Guard Members Miss 1st Paycheck Due to Shutdown  [SEP]  The nation's 42,000 active-duty Coast Guard members missed their scheduled paycheck Tuesday, as the only military branch to work without pay during the government shutdown, NBC News reported. Because the Coast Guard is under the Department of Homeland Security, it is getting no funding during the shutdown. All other parts of the military are under the still-funded Department of Defense.
Strong earthquake shakes areas north of Philippine capital  [SEP]  MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A strong earthquake has shaken the area around the Philippine capital, prompting thousands of people to flee to safety. There were no immediate reports of injuries or widespread damage. The U.S. Geological Survey says the magnitude 6.3 quake struck northwest of Manila on Monday afternoon. It says the quake was centered near the town of Gutad on Luzon island. Philippine Institute of Seismology and Volcanology chief Renato Solidum says the quake, which was caused by movement of a local fault, was not strong enough to trigger a tsunami or cause widespread damage. However, some officials reported damage to a church in northern Pampanga province and said boulders rolled down a mountain, blocking a highway. Thousands of residents and office workers dashed out of buildings in Manila.
A look at the 2 candidates for North Macedonia's presidency | Kathimerini  [SEP]  Presidential candidate Stevo Pendarovski (c) from the ruling SDSM addresses the Roma community as candidate Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova (c down) from opposition VMRO-DPMNE watches on the last day of the presidential campaign in Skopje, North Macedonia, Friday. More than 1.8 million voters choose between two candidates in the second round of North Macedonia's presidential election which is scheduled for Sunday. Newly renamed North Macedonia heads to the polls on Sunday for runoff presidential elections. Two candidates, both university professors, are competing for the post after the third candidate was knocked in last month’s first round. Although the president has a largely ceremonial position, with some powers to veto legislation, the outcome of the vote could trigger early parliamentary elections in a country deeply polarized between the governing Social Democrats and the opposition VMRO-DPMNE conservatives. Turnout will be crucial, with 40 percent needed for the election to be valid. The first round barely made it past that point, with a turnout of 41.8 percent. Campaigning in the first round centered on a recent deal the Balkan country reached with neighboring Greece to rename itself North Macedonia in exchange for Athens dropping objections to it joining NATO and the European Union. This time round, the candidates have focused more on the issues of corruption, crime, poverty and brain drain. Here is a look at the two contenders for North Macedonia’s presidency. Gordana Siljanovska Davkova, 63: The first woman to run for president since the country declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. Known for her love of yoga and rock ‘n’ roll, Siljanovska, a constitutional law professor, first emerged as a non-partisan candidate promoted by her university. Her nomination is now supported by the main conservative opposition VMRO-DPMNE party. Siljanovska campaigned under the slogan “Justice for Macedonia, fatherland calls.” She has been a vocal opponent of the deal with Greece that changed the country’s name to North Macedonia and had hinted she would challenge the name agreement in the International Court of Justice in The Hague. But last week, Siljanovska said during a debate on national television MTV she will not “spend the whole mandate in reviewing the name agreement with Greece.” “I will fight for democratization of the undemocratic Macedonian political system,” she added. During a campaign speech, Siljanovska said her country needs a “radical reversal,” and described it as being “in many elements a failed state.” Siljanovska served as minister without portfolio in 1992-1994 in the first government after independence and participated in writing the country’s first constitution. Stevo Pendarovski, 56: A former national security adviser for two previous presidents and until recently national coordinator for NATO, this is Pendarovskis second bid for the presidency after being defeated by Gjorge Ivanov in 2014. Pendarovski is running as the joint candidate for the governing social democrats and the junior governing coalition partner, the ethnic Albanian Democratic Union for Integration party. His candidacy is also supported by 29 smaller political parties. He has defended the name deal with Greece, arguing it paved the way for the country to nearly finalize its NATO accession and led to hopes EU membership talks will begin in June. His slogan “Forward Together” reflects his main campaign platform of unity, and he has made NATO and EU membership a key strategic goal, saying they will bring foreign investment, jobs and higher wages and prevent young people leaving the country. “People should know what is at stake, they should not stay passive,” he said during the television debate. “They have to go out and choose between two concepts – the one that is for progress, cohesion and integration in the strongest international organizations, [and] the other that draws the country back in time.” [AP]
Afghan official: vice president unhurt in Taliban ambush  [SEP]  KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — An Afghan official says that Afghanistan's vice president, Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, has escaped unharmed after Taliban ambushed his convoy while traveling form northern Balkh to neighboring Zawzjan province. Munir Ahmad Farhad, spokesman for the provincial governor of Balkh, said Sunday that a security guard in the convoy was killed, and two others wounded, in the attack. Farhad says Taliban militants attacked the convoy at two points, in the Char Bolak and then Faiz Abad district, Saturday afternoon. A statement by Afghanistan's army says four Taliban were killed, and seven others wounded, during the two assaults. Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, claimed responsibility for the attack against Dostum.
Man killed in Salmon Arm church shooting remembered as father figure to many  [SEP]  Gordon Parmenter was a church elder known for his skill connecting with people Gord and Peggy Parmenter hold a family tree diagram which their son David said is now missing an important root after Gord was killed in a shooting at the Salmon Arm Church of Christ on Sunday, April 14. (Photo Contributed) Gordon Parmenter is remembered as a father figure to many who had a way of connecting with people. Parmenter, 78, was killed Sunday, April 14, during a shooting at the Salmon Arm Church of Christ that left another man injured. “There’s a lot of people he informally parented through the years, just being there for people who are struggling,” said Gordon’s son David, deeply shaken by the loss. David said his father lived his faith and took his role as church elder seriously. “For him it wasn’t just work, he was actually there for people,” David said. “He just 100 per cent gave of his time and his energies to serving others.” Every Sunday afternoon, after church, Gordon would meet with elderly members of the congregation who have difficulty leaving their homes.

He worked as a manager for Coca Cola, a job which brought him to the Vernon area in the 1980s. The Parmenter family came to the Shuswap when Gordon bought a stake in a pig farm in Tappen in the late ‘80s. “He loved this area, he loved the people here,” David said. In his spare time, Gordon tried his hand as a pilot, scuba diver, rock hound and cabinet maker. David said his father accomplished a lot in his life and was always learning and trying new things. A fire, which the police called suspicious at the time, tore through the trailer Gordon lived in on March 14. The family escaped the fire unharmed.

Venezuela Supreme Court judge flees to US to protest Maduro  [SEP]  Venezuela Supreme Court judge flees to US to protest Maduro CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — A Venezuelan Supreme Court justice who has been a longtime government loyalist has fled to the U.S., saying he's protesting President Nicolas Maduro's plans for a second term. Christian Zerpa told Miami-based broadcaster EVTV that Venezuela's high court has become an appendage of Maduro's inner circle since he and a group of ruling party members were appointed to the bench in 2015. He said Sunday that he decided to break with Maduro because he didn't want to play a role legitimizing his rule when the Supreme Court swears him in for a second term this week. Supreme Court chief justice Maikel Moreno said Sunday that Zerpa fled to escape allegations of sexual harassment. Zerpa is among top Venezuelan officials who have been sanctioned by Canada.
Five arrested over Brazil mining dam collapse as community demands answers  [SEP]  Brazilian authorities have arrested five people in connection with a dam collapse that killed at least 65 people as it plastered part of a city with reddish-brown mud and mining waste. The arrests came as rescue crews worked for the fifth day and searched for survivors or bodies of the hundreds missing. Three employees of Brazilian miner Vale SA and two other engineers working on behalf of the company have been arrested, deepening a crisis for the company after another deadly disaster at one of its mines. Vale said it was cooperating with the investigators probing the mining catastrophe, which is likely to leave a death toll of more than 300 people. Two of Vale's senior managers at the Corrego do Feijao mine — where a tailings dam burst last Friday, drowning the nearby town of Brumadinho in mining waste — were among those arrested, according to Minas Gerais state judge Perla Saliba Brito. The job of the third Vale employee was not immediately clear. Two other engineers, who worked on behalf of Vale and are accused of attesting to the safety of the dam, were arrested in Sao Paulo, state prosecutors said. State investigators issued a total of five arrest warrants and seven search warrants, on suspicion of murder, falsification of documents and environmental crimes, the judge's decision showed. Offers of recompense from Vale have largely fallen on deaf ears. Chief financial officer Luciano Siani said Vale was doing all it could, offering money to mourners, extra tax payments to local government, a special membrane to remove mud from the river and major investments to make its dams safer. Yet residents in the devastated town of Brumadinho have been unmoved, watching in shock and anger as one dead body after another has been pulled from the mud. The collapse of the dam in the hilly, pastoral region has caused 65 confirmed deaths so far, according to firefighters' count on Monday night, with another 279 people lost and likely dead. This latest disaster's proximity to the Samarco breach has made Vale unforgivable in the eyes of many Brazilians. "There's anger, sadness, everything," he said, holding back tears as he surveyed the destruction in Corrego do Feijao, a small hamlet within Brumadinho that gave its name to the mine at the centre of the disaster. Mr Siani said the company would donate 100,000 reais ($37,350) to each family that had lost a loved one, adding the company would continue paying mining royalties to Brumadinho despite a halt in operations there. The company was building a membrane to stop the flow of mud now snaking down the Paraopeba River. A "bold" investment plan would also speed up the process of making dams more secure, he said. Vale and Brasilia agree that regulations are broken Prosecutors and politicians have not been impressed. Brazil's top prosecutor said the company should be criminally prosecuted and executives held personally responsible. Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque said the regulatory model for the mining industry was broken. In a TV interview on Sunday, Vale CEO Fabio Schvartsman seemed to agree.
Daily Bulletin: Pak to release IAF pilot; Sushma to attend OIC meet in Abu Dhabi; Netanyahu may be indicted; day's top stories  [SEP]  Indian Air Force pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman is set to return after two days in Pakistani captivity. The announcement by Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan on Thursday evening brought relief to Indians. The IAF pilot was captured on Wednesday after his MiG-21 fighter jet crashed in an aerial combat with a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet. Soon, videos surfaced showing him being captured and in the custody of the Pakistani army. The information technology ministry has directed YouTube to remove 11 videos showing the Wing Commander. The Wing Commander's family is expected to receive him, along with Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh. Sources have told News18 that the pilot will be brought from Rawalpindi to Lahore by a special plane and then handed over to the Indian side. Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj will attend the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation's Foreign Ministers Conclave as guest of honour in Abu Dhabi on Friday. After initially saying that he would boycott the meet, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi announced on Thursday that he would attend too. Swaraj will attend the inaugural plenary of the two-day meeting on Friday. This is the first time that India has been invited to an OIC meeting as a guest of honour. The Indian Air Force on Thursday showed parts of Advanced Medium Range Air-To-Air Missile (AMRAAM) missiles as proof that F-16 aircraft from Pakistan attacked the Indian military. New Delhi has alleged that Pakistan resorted to unprovoked ceasefire violations in response to the counter-terror strike carried out by India. Bilateral ties between the two countries has deteriorated in the wake of the 14 February Pulwama attack by Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed and India's subsequent strikes on the organisation's camp at Balakot. Pakistani authorities have suspended the Samjhauta Express train service between Pakistan and India until further notice. Reports say Indian Railways too has plans of scrapping the train service. Modi to address rallies in AP, TN; Rahul in Maharashtra The Praja Chaitanya Sabha, a public meeting organised by the Andhra Pradesh chapter of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at Visakhapatnam will be addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The prime minister will also address people at Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu, where he is set to launch and lay the foundation stones for highway projects worth Rs 2,995 crore. Meanwhile, Congress president Rahul Gandhi will be launching the party's Lok Sabha poll campaign in Maharashtra from Dhule. He will also address rallies in Mumbai. Benjamin Netanyahu may be indicted on bribery charges Israel's attorney general is set to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for bribery, breach of trust and fraud, media reports said Thursday ahead of a widely expected announcement. Various Israeli outlets said Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit would move to indict the premier pending a hearing, where Netanyahu would be given a chance to defend himself before charges are filed. However, Netanyahu's Likud party dismissed corruption allegations against him as "political persecution" after media reported that the attorney general was set to move to indict him for bribery. No nuclear agreement between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un The nuclear summit between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Hanoi ended without an agreement Thursday, the White House said after the two leaders cut short their discussions. They had "very good and constructive meetings" and "discussed various ways to advance denuclearisation and economic driven concepts", White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. But she went on, "No agreement was reached at this time," adding that their "respective teams look forward to meeting in the future." No joint communique was issued, despite high expectations beforehand for progress. Following several disturbing reports of flourishing paedophile networks on YouTube and of harmful content on videos for kids, YouTube has started taking steps to protect minors. The first of these steps involves comments, which will now be disabled by default on videos featuring minors. A new classification system for comments will also be introduced and stricter policies will be put in place for dealing with content creators who cause “egregious harm to the community.” The Reserve Bank of India approved the amalgamation of " DBS Bank, India" with "DBS Bank India," the entity which has been granted permission to operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary (WOS) of the Singaporean lender. DBS used to operate in the "branch model" and is among the first foreign lenders to come forward and operate as a WOS. In a press release, the RBI said the scheme of amalgamation between the two entities has been sanctioned under the provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The scheme will come into force with effect from today (1 March) and all the branches of DBS Bank in India will function as branches of DBS Bank India, it added. DBS has 12 branches in the country at present and has drawn up plans to take it to 50 branches in 30 cities.

Former finance minister Michael Wilson dead at 81 | The Star  [SEP]  Michael Wilson, a highly respected former politician, Canadian businessman and passionate mental health advocate, has died at the age of 81, according to several media reports. In an emailed statement, Toronto Mayor John Tory said the former federal finance minister — who helped negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement and ushered in the federal goods and services tax — was “one of the most intelligent, decent people I have ever met, inside or outside of politics and public life.” “He was a steady, capable MP, minister and ambassador and led in historic changes such as free trade and the GST which transformed Canada for the good,” Tory said. “But if it’s possible, he may have contributed even more in his life after politics when he became a pioneer in raising awareness of mental illness and for his incredible contributions to post-secondary education through the University of Toronto. “Michael Wilson was a gentle, considerate giant in business, in public life, as a diplomat in Washington, and in our community,” he continued. “He will be sadly missed and on behalf of all of the people of the city of Toronto, I express sincere condolences to his wife, Margie, and the entire Wilson family.” Michael Holcombe Wilson was born on Nov. 4, 1973, and raised in Toronto, where he attended Upper Canada College and the University of Toronto. He worked on Bay Street for two decades before diving into politics and being elected as Conservative MP for Etobicoke Centre in 1979. At the time of his death, Wilson was serving as chairman at Barclays Capital Canada, a position he assumed in 2010. His death was confirmed to the Globe and Mail on Sunday by Bruce Rothney, chief executive officer of Barclays Capital Canada, who said that Wilson died after a battle with cancer. Wilson previously served as Canada’s ambassador to the United States from 2006 to 2009 and as finance minister and industry minister under former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. He was also appointed chancellor of the University of Toronto in 2012 and served two terms before he was succeeded by Rose Patten. Wilson was more recently recognized for his passionate advocacy for mental health, becoming chair of the Mental Health Commission of Canada in 2015. His son, Cameron, died by suicide in 1995 at the age of 29, a personal tragedy that Wilson touched upon in a recent Toronto Star opinion piece. “Mental health has always been an area where I advocated, even before Cameron became ill,” he wrote in the November 2018 op-ed. “I used whatever influence I had to spark quiet conversations in the halls of Parliament and in my constituency office. “For every life that ends in suicide, at least 25 people are forever changed,” he continued. “My life is one of them — and it has taken a winding path.” Jennifer Yang is a Toronto-based reporter covering identity and inequality.

France's yellow vest protesters join union march, a first  [SEP]  PARIS (AP) — France's yellow vest protest movement joined ranks Tuesday with a major union, a first for both, in a day of nationwide protests over taxes and buying power that brought tens of thousands into the streets. Brief scuffles marked the mostly calm Paris demonstration. Police fired several rounds of tear gas, clearing troublemakers from the Place de la Concorde, which borders the U.S. Embassy. Tear gas was also used in Lille and elsewhere. However, tension was minimal compared with the weekly protests held since mid-November by the yellow vest movement to demand fiscal and social justice in a major challenge to President Emmanuel Macron. As protesters marched, lawmakers in the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, voted 387-92 to pass a bill aimed at preventing violence during protests, and helping authorities maintain order. The bill would, for instance, authorize regional prefects to prevent people seen as a serious threat to public order from protesting, or force protesters involved in violence to pay for damage. The bill, which must go before the Senate, would also make it a crime for protesters to conceal their faces — a common occurrence during Saturday protests by the yellow vest movement, by both those trying to offset the effects of tear gas and by troublemakers concealing their identities. Meanwhile, the Communist-backed CGT union marched from Paris City Hall to the Place de la Concorde side-by-side with protesters from the yellow vest movement, which takes its name from the safety vests they wear that are required in all cars. Union chief Philippe Martinez cheered the hand-in-hand protests with the yellow vests, promising daily initiatives and "something big" each Tuesday. He noted overlapping demands between his union and yellow vest protesters. "There's no reason why we shouldn't demonstrate next to each other or one behind another. What's important is that our first day together is a success, in the middle of the week," he said. "I find business leaders have it easy and it's time we hold big company bosses in this country accountable," Martinez said. The grassroots yellow vest movement has no anointed leader and an array of demands. However, increasing buying power and ending what they perceive as favoritism toward the powerful at the expense of the less fortunate are leading demands.

MEPs vote in controversial laws that places copyright responsibility on Google and YouTube  [SEP]  THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT today approved a controversial EU copyright overhaul that hands more power to news publishers and record companies against internet giants like Google and Facebook. Despite an intense debate in parliament and furious lobbying ahead of the vote, MEPs meeting in Strasbourg ended up passing the draft law with 348 votes in favour, 274 against, and 36 abstentions. Under the reform, European law for the first time would hold platforms legally responsible for enforcing copyright, requiring them to check everything that their users post to prevent infringement. European lawmakers were sharply divided on the copyright issue, with both sides subjected to some of the most intense lobbying the EU has ever seen from tech giants, media firms, content creators and online freedom activists. The culmination of a process that began in 2016, the revamp to European copyright legislation was seen as urgently needed, not having been updated since 2001, before the birth of YouTube or Facebook. The reform was loudly backed by media companies and artists, who want to secure revenue from web platforms that allow users to distribute their content. But it was strongly opposed by internet freedom activists and by Silicon Valley, especially Google, which makes huge profits from the advertising generated alongside the content it hosts. After the vote, a Google spokesperson warned that the reform “will still lead to legal uncertainty and will hurt Europe’s creative and digital economies.” The Irish Music Rights Organisation‘s CEO said that this was a “historic day for Irish music and the broader European cultural sector”. The final days before the vote were marked by marches and media stunts, including tens of thousands of people protesting in Germany on Saturday under the slogan “Save the Internet”. A group of people is demonstrating in Nurnberg against the copyright law passed by the EU Parliament. Source: DPA/PA Images There were similar protests in Austria, Poland and Portugal, while major Polish newspapers on Monday printed blank front pages in an appeal that MEPs adopt the reform. “I know there are lots of fears about what users can do or not – now we have clear guarantees for freedom of speech, teaching and online creativity,” Commission vice president Andrus Ansip said after the vote. Germany was at the heart of the anti-reform movement, led by Julia Reda, a 32-year-old Pirate Party MEP who spearheaded a campaign against two of the law’s provisions that have become flashpoints in the debate. Reda said the vote marked a “dark day for internet freedom” and decried that MEPs refused, albeit narrowly, to modify the text before the final vote. For Reda and her supporters the main worry was Article 13, which aims to strengthen the bargaining power of rights holders with platforms such as YouTube, Facebook and Soundcloud, which use their content. Reda and her supporters warned that Article 13 would require platforms to install expensive content filters that would automatically and often erroneously delete content from the web. Speaking after the vote, Reda told AFP that she still hoped the German government would bow to public pressure and demand changes to the law before it is formally adopted. After that, seen by most observers as a formality, member states will have two years to transpose the EU directive into their own legislation. “I think what the ultimate result will be that the internet will become more like cable television,” Reda told AFP. “That generally there is going to be less diversity of online platforms because the risk of running a platform legally will become much higher.” Backers of the law, led by MEP Axel Voss, answered that filters are not a requirement but they do not explain how companies can comply with Article 13 without them. The second article advocated the creation of a “neighbouring right” to copyright for news media. This is designed to enable news companies to demand payment when their output is used by information aggregators like Google News or social networks such as Facebook. Major publishers including AFP have pushed hard for the reform, seeing it as an urgent remedy to safeguard quality journalism and the plummeting earnings of traditional media companies. The reform, if properly implemented by member states “can help to maintain journalism in the field, which all evidence shows is still the best way to combat misinformation,” said AFP CEO Fabrice Fries. But opponents have called it a “link tax” that will stifle discourse on the internet and pay only big media companies, with no real benefits for journalists or news gatherers. The reform is staunchly backed by France and several other member states, but some countries may decide to use the flexibility built into the reform that allows a loose interpretation of the rules.
Preliminary report says Ethiopia crew followed Boeing rules but couldn’t stop crash  [SEP]  The Ethiopian Airlines crew of the jet that crashed last month performed all the procedures recommended by Boeing but could not control the jet, states the preliminary report of the data from the plane. The doomed flight experienced "nose dive conditions," according to the investigation announced Thursday by Ethiopia's Minister of Transport Dagmawit Moges. The preliminary report recommends that the flight control system should be reviewed by Boeing and that aviation authorities should verify the system before the aircraft is released to operation. Boeing declined to comment pending its review of the preliminary report. The Boeing 737 Max 8 jet crashed on March 10 shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa, killing all 157 on board. It was the second crash of a 737 Max within five months, following a Lion Air crash in Indonesia. Following the Ethiopian disaster, the Max jets have been grounded worldwide pending a software fix that Boeing is rolling out, which must still receive approval from the Federal Aviation Administration and other regulators.
Japan's Okinawa votes on controversial U.S. base move  [SEP]  'It can be a test to gauge if democracy is working in Japan,' says Ryukyu University professor Jun Shimabukuro OKINAWA, Japan – Residents of Japan's Okinawa were casting ballots Sunday, February 24, in a closely watched referendum on the controversial relocation of a United States military base to a remote part of the island. The vote is seen as highly symbolic but is also non-binding, raising questions about what effect it will have, even if opponents of the move, including Okinawa Governor Denny Tamaki, prevail. The ballot asks residents whether they support a plan to reclaim land at a remote coastal site for the relocation of the Futenma base from its current location in a heavily-populated part of Okinawa. It was initially planned as a yes-no vote on the move, but a "neither" option was added after several cities with close ties to the central government threatened to boycott the vote. Polls opened early on Sunday morning, with about 1.15 million Okinawans eligible to vote. The Jiji Press agency reported around 20.5 percent of eligible voters had already cast ballots in early voting by Saturday. "They are using a lot of tax money and manpower for this referendum, even though the result will not have any legal power. So we thought that we should take this opportunity and think very carefully about this issue," said Yuki Miyagaki, after casting her ballot at a local school. "We usually shout no to the new base construction. This is a good opportunity to tell the government directly with concrete numbers: 'No'. This is an important vote," 32-year-old Narumi Haine told AFP. Although the referendum is not legally binding, "it is significant that people in Okinawa can express their will through the vote," said Jun Shimabukuro, a professor at Ryukyu University in Okinawa. "It can be a test to gauge if democracy is working in Japan," Shimabukuro told Agence France-Presse before voting opened. The relocation of Futenma to Nago, 50 kilometers (30 miles) away, was first agreed in 1996 as the US sought to calm local anger after US servicemen gang-raped a local schoolgirl. But the plan has long been stalled in part over local opposition. 'Making a fool of Okinawa' The Futenma base has stoked tension with local residents over problems ranging from noise and military accidents to crime involving base residents. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government says the relocation will address those concerns, but many in Okinawa want the base relocated elsewhere in Japan. They argue that the region bears a disproportionate burden when it comes to hosting US military troops in the country. Okinawa accounts for less than one percent of Japan's total land area, but hosts more than half of the approximately 47,000 American military personnel stationed in Japan. Anti-base rallies have been staged daily in Okinawa since campaigning for the referendum began in mid-February. But the vote has not stopped reclamation work at Nago, with construction workers continuing to shovel dirt into the ocean offshore with bulldozers. "We hope the referendum will boost the momentum of our fight," demonstrator Masaru Shiroma told AFP on Friday, as more than 100 fellow activists tried to block trucks entering the construction site on Friday. "The government is making a fool out of Okinawa." 'Precious votes' The ballot closes at 8:00 pm with exit polls expected soon after and official results from as early as midnight. Okinawa's governor is required to "respect" the vote's outcome if at least a quarter of eligible voters — around 290,000 votes — vote for any one option. Tamaki has urged residents to turn out and cast their "precious votes" in the poll. An opinion poll by the Asahi Shimbun newspaper this week found 59 percent of people in Okinawa oppose the reclamation while 16 percent support it. (READ: Eyeing China, U.S. to hold missile drill in Japan's Okinawa – report) The survey also found 80 percent of respondents want Abe's government to respect the results. But there has been little sign Abe's government will shift course if the vote goes against the move, with Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga saying there were no plans to halt the relocation regardless of the outcome. Japan's military alliance with the United States is seen as a key partnership, and Okinawa's location near Taiwan has long been viewed as having huge strategic importance for US forward positioning in Asia. – Rappler.com
Scotland lose to Kazakhstan and fans are RAGING - Should McLeish and McFadden be SACKED?  [SEP]  Scotland are losing to Kazakhstan and fans want Alex McLeish sacked Scotland sent an under-strength side out to Kazakhstan for their first European qualifier for next summer’s tournament. A number of star men are missing from Alex McLeish’s side due to injury. But the Scots were nonetheless not expecting the thrashing dished out by their hosts in Astana. Scotland were 2-0 down within 10 minutes and conceded again early in the second half.
Guatemala presidential candidate targeted over financing  [SEP]  GUATEMALA CITY — Prosecutors in Guatemala sought Wednesday to have presidential candidate Sandra Torres Casanova’s immunity from prosecution withdrawn over a case of millions in alleged illicit campaign financing four years ago. Juan Francisco Sandoval, head of the anti-impunity prosecutors’ office, or FECI, said Torres’ National Unity of Hope party is suspected of receiving about $2.5 million for the 2015 presidential election from businesses, contributions that were not reported to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. “The crimes which would be charged are illicit association, perjury, illicit and unreported electoral financing and tax fraud,” Sandoval said. At a news conference, Torres laid blame on former chief prosecutor Thelma Aldana, who is planning her own presidential bid, and accused Sandoval of persecuting her at Aldana’s bidding. “We see dark political intentions behind all this. Behind all this there is a person (Aldana), a criminal structure embedded in the FECI. It wants to harm me,” Torres said, adding that she would not allow the election to be “stolen.” Torres ran in the 2015 race, which was won by current President Jimmy Morales. She was accredited Tuesday as a candidate for the election this June, a status that confers legal immunity from prosecution. Sandoval also said four people were arrested, prosecutors were seeking to lift the immunity of four lawmakers from the same party and the party’s headquarters were being searched for documents related to the case. Under Guatemalan law the request to withdraw Torres’ immunity will go to the Supreme Court for consideration. Wednesday’s announcement by prosecutors arose from an investigation in partnership with a U.N.-sponsored anti-corruption commission that Morales has moved to sideline after it pressed investigations of him, some relatives and some associates. The president denies wrongdoing. As chief prosecutor Aldana worked closely with the commission, known as CICIG, bringing graft cases that swept up dozens of public officials and businesspeople including then-President Otto Perez Molina. That record brought her acclaim at home and abroad and put her in position to launch a presidential bid this year. National Unity of Hope is the party of former President Alvaro Colom, who was elected in 2008 and is currently free on bail while under investigation for purported embezzlement. He, too, denies wrongdoing.
Pakistan minister says ready to return pilot to ease India tension  [SEP]  ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan would be prepared to return the Indian pilot shot down and captured this week if it helped ease the crisis with its neighbor, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told Pakistani television station Geo TV on Thursday. “We are willing to return the captured Indian pilot if it leads to de-escalation,” he was quoted as saying. He also said the Saudi foreign minister was expected to visit Pakistan with a special message from Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who visited both Pakistan and India earlier this month.
Venezuela’s devastating blackout stretches into Friday  [SEP]  Venezuela’s massive power outage stretched into a second day on Friday, with schools and offices closed while millions were left stranded by what the government called an act of sabotage. Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said on the Venezuelan state TV network Telesur that President Nicolás Maduro had ordered schools and offices shut on Friday because of the blackout. The state electricity company, Corpolec, said the blackout was due to “sabotage” of the Guri hydroelectric complex in southern Bolivar state — the source of most of the country’s electricity. But authorities provided no evidence of that. President Nicolás Maduro blamed the United States for the outage in a late night tweet. “The power war announced and directed by U.S. imperialism against our people will be defeated. Nothing and no one can defeat the people of Bolivar and Chavez. Total unity of the patriotic people!” Blackouts have become common in Venezuela as a severe economic crisis has made it difficult to perform maintenance or purchase imported spare parts. But the outage Thursday appeared to be broader than usual, with local media reports saying it had hit nearly all of the country’s 23 states. Wealthier neighborhoods awoke Friday to the sound of generators, but in the poorer areas, the lack of electricity also meant no running water because the water pumps weren’t working. Opposition leader Juan Guaidó tweeted late Thursday that the blackout had gone on for a record number of hours in Caracas. “This power outage is evidence of the inefficiency of the usurper,” he said, referring to Maduro. “The recovery of the electrical sector — and the country” — will come through ending the usurpation.” Guaidó maintains that Maduro has “usurped” power by winning a second term in an election marred by widespread irregularities. Venezuela is especially tense at the moment, as a U.S.-backed opposition movement seeks to push Maduro from power. Over 50 countries have recognized the National Assembly speaker, Juan Guaidó, as the legitimate president of Venezuela, citing irregularities in Maduro’s reelection last year. The opposition leader is planning a massive rally Saturday. Maduro accuses him of attempting a coup with help from Washington. The U.S. government in January imposed stiff sanctions on Venezuelan oil — its principal export — but there was no sign the blackout was related to that. In a series of tweets overnight, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ridiculed the Venezuelan government for blaming outsiders for the power outage. “The power outage and the devastation hurting ordinary Venezuelans is not because of the USA. It’s not because of Colombia. It’s not Ecuador or Brazil, Europe or anywhere else. Power shortages and starvation are the result of the Maduro regime’s incompetence,” he wrote. “No food. No medicine. Now, no power. Next, no Maduro,” he added in another tweet. [How bad is Venezuela’s economy? Even the criminals are struggling to get by.] The outage began about 5 p.m., at the start of rush hour. In some office buildings in Caracas, people were trapped in elevators. Long lines stretched along main avenues as residents scrambled to get on the few public buses that were still running despite a shortage of parts. Traffic clogged the streets, as traffic signals stopped working. Maria Lopez, 35, a cleaning woman, normally rides the metro but was forced to walk to her home — several miles away — after the trains shut down. “I live so far away. And all of Caracas is without power,” she said, as she trudged along a main avenue. Tomas Castro, 36, a government employee, watched throngs of people pouring down the street in a central business district. “This is not going to lead to any uprising. People have grown used to it,” he said, predicting that Maduro’s government would be removed only by force. “Today there’s a blackout. Tomorrow there are shortages. Then there is the insane crime,” he said, ticking off the city’s problems. Nonetheless, anger at the government was palpable. Periodically, pedestrians broke into a popular chant, disparaging Maduro’s mother. Blackouts are just one of the problems that are increasingly crippling the country. There are frequent water shortages, inflation is soaring toward 10 million percent, and over 3 million people have migrated abroad in the past few years.

What we know about the disappearance of Emiliano Sala  [SEP]  PARIS, France, Jan 22 – Premier League club Cardiff City’s record new signing, Argentine striker Emiliano Sala, is missing presumed dead after a light aircraft he was travelling in disappeared over the English Channel on Monday. Here’s what we know about the incident: Sala, 28, signed for Cardiff for a fee reported to be around £15 million ($19 million) last weekend and was heading to the Welsh capital after saying his final goodbyes to former team-mates at French Ligue 1 Nantes on Monday. He had scored 13 goals for the club this season, which attracted Cardiff’s interest as they fight to avoid relegation from the Premier League. Sala had posted a photo on his Instagram account surrounded by players from the French club saying “La ultima ciao (the last goodbye).” French civil aviation authorities confirmed that Sala was on board a single-propeller Piper light aircraft that went missing off the Channel Islands on Monday night. A statement from police on Guernsey, a British Crown dependency just off the coast of France, said the pilot had requested to lower his altitude shortly before air traffic control in neighbouring Jersey lost contact with the plane when it was flying at 2,300 feet (700 metres). After a search was called off on Monday because of high winds, two helicopters, five aircraft and a lifeboat joined renewed efforts on Tuesday morning to find the plane. One of the rescuers said they were fearing for the worst especially due to the cold temperature of the sea. Guernsey police noted the chances of survival were slim and the efforts would resume at sunrise Wednesday. The Malaysian-owned Welsh club’s executive director Ken Choo expressed his shock as he awaited more information on the missing plane carrying the Argentinian. Nantes president Waldemar Kita said in an official statement his thoughts were with Sala’s friends and family. Nantes fan group ‘A La Nantaise’ released a statement calling for supporters of Sala’s former club to gather in the centre of the city for a vigil at 6:30pm (1730 GMT) on Tuesday.
Coal mine collapses in northern China, killing at least 21  [SEP]  Coal mine collapses in northern China, killing at least 21 BEIJING (AP) — Twenty-one coal miners were killed when a mine collapsed in northern China, state media reported Sunday. The disaster occurred Saturday in Shenmu in Shaanxi province in the heart of the country's coal-mining belt, according to state TV and the Xinhua News Agency. Sixty-six other miners were rescued, the city government said in a statement. The number of fatalities reported in cave-ins, explosions and other disasters in Chinese coal mines has fallen sharply over the past decade but the industry still is the world's deadliest.
The Latest: Israeli military reports air-raid sirens  [SEP]  JERUSALEM (AP) — The Latest on Israel-Gaza (all times local): The Israeli military is reporting air-raid sirens in southern Israel, signaling new rocket fire out of the Gaza Strip. The apparent rocket fire came in response to Israeli airstrikes, launched after an early rocket attack on Tel Aviv. The army's announcement early Friday gave no further details. The Israeli military says it has begun attacking sites in the Gaza Strip in response to a rocket attack on Tel Aviv. The attacks were taking place in the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) south of Gaza City. The warplanes could be heard flying overhead in Gaza City, where smoke from the explosions could be seen in the distance. In a statement early Friday, the army said it was targeting "terror sites." It gave no further details. Palestinian media said a Hamas naval base had been targeted. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip fired two rockets toward Tel Aviv late Thursday, the Israeli military said, marking a significant escalation that raised the likelihood of a harsh Israeli reprisal. The rocket barrage triggered air raid sirens across the city, which is Israel's densely populated commercial and cultural capital. No damage or injuries were reported. But it marked the first time that Tel Aviv, some 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Gaza, has been targeted by rocket fire since a 2014 war with Gaza militants. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rushed to the military headquarters in Tel Aviv and was conferring with senior army officials about a response. In Gaza, there was no immediate claim of responsibility. Brig. Gen. Ronen Manelis, the Israeli army's chief spokesman, said officials had no prior warning of the attack and were trying to determine who fired the rockets. Israel holds Gaza's Hamas rulers responsible for all fire out of the territory. Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai said he had ordered the city to open public air raid shelters as a protective measure. But he said there were no special instructions and encouraged residents to stick to their daily routines. "Continue life as usual," he told Channel 10 TV. "Be calm, but be alert." Gaza is controlled by Hamas, an Islamic militant group that seeks Israel's destruction. Israel and Hamas have fought three wars since Hamas sized control of Gaza in 2007. Hamas possesses a big arsenal of rockets and missiles, but it has sought to contain violence with Israel since the last war in 2014. Hamas denied responsibility for the attack on Tel Aviv, saying the rockets were launched when the group's military wing was meeting with Egyptian mediators to try to strengthen a cease-fire between Gaza militants and Israel. In an unusual step that indicated Hamas was attempting to prevent further escalation, the Hamas Interior Ministry said the rocket fire went "against the national consensus" and promised to take action against the perpetuators.
